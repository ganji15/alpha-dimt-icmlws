you know , one of the big pieces of travel , and one of the pleasure in the ethnographischen research is to live with the people that can remember the old days , which their past the past are still in the wind , they touch on the rain , geglätteten stones , they don &apos;t taste the bitteren of plants .
now , in the himalayas , in the himalayas , in the himalayas , in the himalayas , is even true of the world of anthropology , which is even more important in the himalayas , in the himalayas , is that the central revelation of anthropology is even more important , but that in the himalayas , in the himalayas , in the himalayas , that it &apos;s still true , the central revelation of reality , but only as a model of reality , as a result of a group of certain ways that our wisdom , although many generations .
and of course , we all share the same anpassungsnotwendigkeiten .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing kids to the world .
we go through initiationsrituale .
we have to deal with the unaufhaltsamen trennung trennung through death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dance and art .
but interesting is the unique kind of tonfall , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the penan in the woods forests , or the voodoo-akolythen in the forests , or the voodoo-akolythen in the forests , or the voodoo-akolythen in the forests , or the voodoo-akolythen in the sahara , or the voodoo-akolythen in the sahara , and this is to be the colleague that i &apos;ve traveled to desert a month ago , or even a yak-hirte on the edge of the qomolangma , everest , the gottmutter of the world .
all of these people teach us that there are other existenzmöglichkeiten , different ways , other ways , different ways of light on earth .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it can be done only with hope .
together together , the myriad cultures of the world are a network of spirituellem and kulturellem life , which is the earth , and for the earth , the earth is as important as important as biology , that you know as biosphere .
you can imagine that this cultural lebensnetz as a ethnosphäre , as an ethnosphäre of all the thoughts of all thoughts and dreams , myths , inspiration and intuitionen , by the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness of consciousness .
the ethnosphäre is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are , and what we &apos;re doing as an amazing species .
and as well as the biosphere , this was what was done with the ethnosphäre -- only greater speed .
no biologist , for example , for example , that 50 percent or more of the species of extinction , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , this -- the apokalyptischste szenarium in the field of biological diversity -- is not very much of what &apos;s known to us as a optimistischstes in the field of cultural diversity .
and the crucial indicator of this is extinction .
when any of you were born in this room , 6,000 languages were spoken on earth .
now , a language is not just the set of the vokabulars or a series of grammatikregeln .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means of the soul of a particular culture access access to the physical world .
every language is like a altbestehender forest of the mind , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , they &apos;re not geflüstert in the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught kleinkindern . that if nothing &apos;s done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could lonely be , to be one of the last of your people who speak your language , not to have a way to give the wisdom of the ancestors , or expect the hope ?
and yet , this terrible destiny actually happens to someone somewhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , one of the elderly is dying , and he takes the last silben of an old language to the grave .
and i know that some of them say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; the world doesn &apos;t be a better place if we all talk a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s have this language . let &apos;s be kantonesisch .
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
and then you would suddenly see what it would be if you could not speak your own language .
so i &apos;m going to take you on a journey today through the ethnosphäre , a short journey through the ethnosphäre , to try to understand you what actually lost .
now , there are some of us who are in a sense that i remember , when i say , &quot; different ways of being , &quot; really different ways of being .
so , for example , this child &apos;s child in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the anakonda , believe that they mythologisch the milchfluss from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
this is a people who are not cognitively in between colors and green , because the himmelszelt the forest of the forest depend on the forest .
they have a strange language and a heiratsvorschrift the linguistic exogamie , you know , you have to marry someone who is talking to another language .
all of this is wurzelt in the mythologischen past . this is the funny thing about these big houses that are talked about six or seven languages , but you know , you never hear anyone learning a language .
they &apos;re just listening and start to speak .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the waorani in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first time , friedlich .
in 1957 , five missionare were trying to record five missionare and made a schwerwiegenden mistake .
they warfen photos from the air , which we would judge as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people from the rainforest in their life had never seen anything else in their life .
they lifted these photographs of the forest floor , trying to see the face or the character , nothing and schlussfolgerten that this is a business business business cards , and killed the five missionare with the spear .
but the waorani didn &apos;t only kill the spear .
they durchbohrten each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened by durchbohrungen .
we followed the geneaologie eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we were looking at the people with a little bit about it , they gave them that one of the people had become so old that he died because of his age , and we killed him to the spear .
but at the same time , they had a clear idea of forest that was amazing .
their jäger could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps away and determine what animal animals that owned .
so in the early few years , i got a really amazing task , when my professor asked , if i was interested in to go to haiti and the secret to the secret societies that were the source of duvalier and tonton macoutes , and the poison that was used for this to make zombies , to make sure .
so to give sense , of course , i had to believe something about this remarkable belief , of course , and voodoo is not a cult of the black magic .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex kind of structure .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i was asking them , the great world world , what would you say ?
christianity , buddhism , buddhism , judaismus or whatever .
a continent is always left because the guess that there was no religious faith in sub-saharan africa , of course , there was a religious belief , of course , and it &apos;s just a überbleibsel of these very profound religious religious thoughts , which is during the tragic diaspora of sklavereizeit .
but what makes so interesting is that living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living gave the minds .
the minds can be heraufbeschwört under the big water , answers to the rhythm of the living vorübergehend , so that the akolyth for a brief glänzenden moment is going to be to the god .
deshab likes to say , &quot; your white one goes to church and talk about god .
we &apos;re dancing in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to take it from the mind . how can you do damage ?
you see this amazing : voodoo-akolythen in a trancezustand , the glühende coal , which has an amazing visualization of the ability to influence the body so that this is aushält when it will be versetzt in a state .
well , from all the people i &apos;ve met , the kogi of the sierra nevada de de marta in nordkolumbien , the most special .
nachkommen of the old tyrannischen civilization that die the heart of the karibische civilization , who came up with this people in a isoliertes vulkanisches massive that is rising on the karibischen karibischen .
in a blutbefleckten continent , these people were the only ones who have never been erobert by the spaniern .
to today &apos;s day , you &apos;re regiert by a ritual of a ritual , but that is very extraordinary .
the young akolythen are separated at the age of three and four years from their families , and in a schattenhaften world , in a schattenhaften world for 18 and four years from their families , for 18 years from their families at the age of the glacier for 18 years , for the nine months of pregnancy that they did in the lap of their mother &apos;s lap , now , in the lap of the great mother .
and during all this time , they will be introduced to the values of their society , values that keep the claim that their prayers and just their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say that the ecological balance .
so , at the end of the first time in the end of the first light of the first light , you know , you know , all of the time , when the sun begins , suddenly , you know , all you see in the abstract beautiful scale , all of a sudden , all of a sudden , what you &apos;ve been learned in the abstract scale , and the priest comes back , and the priest comes back and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really how i told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , the destruction of the world &apos;s destruction .
now this level of intuition is very important .
always when we think about eingeborene and landscape , we either think of rousseau and the old gerücht , and the old wild , which is an rassistischer thought , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
so , then , eingeborene are not sentimental , you get out of the nostalgie .
it &apos;s not a lot of space in the malariaverseuchten of asmat or the cold winds of tibet , but they still have shaped through time and ritual , which is not shaped in the idea of being close , but on a very subtileren intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist , because it &apos;s going to be in human consciousness .
well , what does that mean ?
and it means that a little bit of the anden , he &apos;s going to be a little bit of another person who &apos;s going to be a apu-geist , which is going to be a apu-geist , which is going to be a apu-geist , and a different relationship to this resource or this place , as a little kid from montana , which is going to think that a mountain is a bunch of rocks that can be abgetragen .
whether he &apos;s a aufenthaltsort of a mind or a bunch of erz , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defined the relationship between the individual and the nature .
i grew up in the forests of britisch colombia , and believed that these forests are there to be gerodet .
and that made me a different person than my friends , who believe that these forests are the aufenthaltsort of the aufenthaltsort and the gebogenen , and the kannibalischen and the kannibalischen minds , who are in the nordende of the world who are living in the world who would be involved in their hamatsa-initiation .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took only last april april in the amazon .
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard of , the most powerful psychoaktive involvement from the repertoire of the schamanen .
this is not just made of two different things , which is a number of two different sources , is not just the most important potential of this präparats , and on the one side -- on the one side , and on the one side of two different sources of betakarbolinen -- on the one hand , there &apos;s a series of two different sources . on the one hand , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , as if a blue trüber smoke .
this plant contains a few very strong tryptamine that are very much similar to the serotonin , dimethyltryptamin-5 and methoxydimethyltryptamin .
if you &apos;ve seen the yanomami , you &apos;ve seen this stuff , that substance that they make in different ways contains in different ways .
this powder is to schnupfen something like this as a gewehrlauf shot , gesäumt of barocken paintings , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it won &apos;t produce a verzerrung of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i &apos;ve even got out with my professor , richard evan shultes , who has been talking to the psychedelische in mexico 30iger , and i &apos;ve been talking about it . i said that you could not as a halluzinogen in the moment , because at the moment you feel the effects , you &apos;re not there anymore to experience a halluzination .
but the thing about tryptaminen is that they can &apos;t be taken oral , because she &apos;s in the human gut , of course , vorkommendes enzym by namen , .
you can only deal with some different chemicals with some other chemicals , which the mao denaturieren .
now the amazing thing is that the betakarboline , which are in the liane , in the same way , in the way that are necessary to potenzieren , you know , ask yourself .
how can these people find out of a typical species of adstringierender plants , these two morphologisch plants , these two morphologisch plants that , if in this way , in this way , create a kind of biochemischer version , so that the whole greater than the sum of its parts is ?
we use this great grant , trial and mistakes , which it turns out .
but you ask the indians to say , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the cofan , did 17 varieties of ayahuasca that all of them in the forest , which are in the forest for our eyes .
and then you ask them how they put their taxonomie , and they say , &quot; i thought you understand some plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties of vollmond and you can sing in a different tonlage .
now , this is not a ph.d. at harvard at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than stamina .
now , this is the problem that even those of us who have a sympathy for the difficult of native people , they as orginiell and farbenfroh , they &apos;re sort of looking at the past , as the real world , that means our world .
so , in fact , you know , in the 20th century , in 300 years , we don &apos;t remember the 20th century , for 300 years , in 300 years , in a era , in 300 years , it &apos;s about a era that we &apos;ve been in and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth either or passive or passive . so the problem is not the change .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new lebenmöglichkeiten .
and the problem is not the technology .
the sioux-indianer didn &apos;t have heard less in the sioux , as you have the bow and arrow the arrow , as americans stopped being americans , when they &apos;re horse and pferdewagen .
not change and technology bedrohen the integrity of ethnosphäre . it &apos;s power . ugly face of regime regime .
and in fact , you know , you know , in the flussufer , you know , you know , if you can see , that cultures are going to be verdrängt on the horizon , which is going to be bereit in front of the südchinesische , which is going to be bereit in front of the südchinesische , who are willing to be verdrängt on the horizon , who are willing to be frei on the horizon , who are willing to put their schiffsräume with raw baumstämmen , which they entrissen the forest , or like in the case of the yanomami , where they are krankheitsträger , that became eingeschleppt during the goldrauschs .
or if we go to tibet , where i do a lot of research , you &apos;ll see ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the phyische extinction of people in general , but the ethnozid , the destruction of people &apos;s lives , is not verurteilt , but in general and vielerorts as part of a entwicklungsstrategie .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering if you don &apos;t have experienced it at unterster .
i had a young colleagues of chengdu von by chengdu überland by südost-tibet durch durch by südost-tibet durch , and i saw the face of the statistics of the statistics , 6,000 holy monuments , 6,000 , 6,000 , 6,000 holy monuments that were verwandelt , 1.2 , 1.2 million people who were killed during the cultural revolution .
the father of this young manns was identified as followers of the panchen lama .
that meant he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle is floh with her holiness to the diaspora people who brought people to nepal .
his mother became locked , as punishment punishment for -- for the crime .
he was geschmuggelt in the age of two years in prison to hide under her rockzipfel , because she couldn &apos;t live without it .
the sister who was doing these brave , was brought into a erziehungslager .
and one day , she came out of a armband , and she had to work on a schweres , for seven years .
the suffering can be unerträglich , but the erlösende spirit of people is something unvergessliches .
and in the end , we really have a choice , and we want to live in a monochromatischen world of monotonie , or in a polychromatischen world of diversity ?
margaret mead , who said it was going to say that it &apos;s their greatest fear that as she died , it &apos;s their greatest fear that while we died , the whole range of human imagination , we &apos;re not only able to see the whole range of human imagination , but that we &apos;re going to wake up one day from a dream , and forget that there &apos;s ever been other possibilities .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species has been there for 600,000 years .
the neolithische revolution that brought us to agriculture , and at this moment , in this moment of saatkorns unterwarf , the poetry of the priesterschaft , the poetry of the priesterschaft priesterschaft and hierarchy , specialization -- found only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we are in the next millennia .
if we weltkulturen the importance of people &apos;s meaning to the meaning of human beings , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song we &apos;ll be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be aware of the importance of the importance of all people who are aware of all the people and gardens have a room , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took on the northern end of the baffin-inseln , when i went to narwhal-jagd , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the 50iger years of the etablierung of our regime , they were forced to draw in settlements .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather refused to be refused .
the family , the fear of his life , he took all the guns and all the tools .
now you have to know , the inuit are not afraid of the cold , they used it to their advantage to their advantage .
the gleitschienen of their schlitten were originally made out of fish that were made in karibu-haut .
the man &apos;s grandfather was not frightened of the arctic night or the white storm .
he schlüpfte out , his pants made out of seehundsfell and defäkierte into his hand , and when the feces started to cold , he formed it in the form of a messers .
he sprühte speichel the pages of the fäkalien-messers , and when it was completely frozen , he got a dog with it .
he enthäutete the dog and improvisierte a geschirr , the skeleton of the dog , and improvisierte a schlitten , spannte another dog , and entschwand a anderen on the eisschollen on the gürtel .
you can &apos;t do something out of anything .
and this is in many ways a symbol of the resistance and all of the resistance in the world &apos;s resistance .
the canadian government gave the inuit to the complete control of the entire control of a field that &apos;s bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country , and it &apos;s called nunavut .
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control mineralvorkommen .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state , the wiedergutmachung wiedergutmachung with his people .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are traveled to these distant aim of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they &apos;re the heimatländer of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that zurückreichen in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children are going to be , like the dreams of our own children are part of the geography of hope .
what we end up trying to do at national geographic is that we think politicians will never achieve anything .
we think that polemik -- we believe that polemik is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably probably the best institution for storytelling in the world , our website takes 35 million hits every month .
156 nations send our fernsehkanal .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we take a series of travel in the ethnosphäre that we &apos;re going to take with our audience in places like this , and you know , you know , you know , in the ethnosphäre , you know , that the world has made it , in different ways that we can find a lebensmöglichkeit in a really multicultural world in a really multicultural pluralistischen world , where the wisdom of all people can contribute to our shared well-being .
thank you .
what i &apos;m first going to show you , as quickly as as as possible , is a new technology , a new technology , a new technology that we &apos;re building microsoft as part of a year in a year , in a year , and it &apos;s seadragon , and it &apos;s an environment where you can either deal with huge amounts of visual amounts of data .
we see many , a lot of gigabytes of digital photographs here , which you can get and heranholen , you know , you know , in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are the digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the kongressbibliothek , and it &apos;s in a field of 300 megapixeln .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that the performance of a system can be constrained like this is the number of a system like this einschränken , in every single moment . it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of nichtbild-daten .
this is bleak house of the dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not about a picture , we can do something like that to really show that this is a real representation of the texts and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a e-buch .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a realistischerer case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a abschnitts .
and that gives you really the pleasure and the good experience of a magazine or a paper or reading , which is a kind of a medium with a new scale .
we also did something on the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a false ad with very high resolution that is much higher than a normal display , and we added extra content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even some technical .
and this actually reaches these ideas , these limitations for the available place on the screen .
we hope that this is no more pop-ups and other nonsense -- that shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re going to be contributing to this area .
but these are all the streets in the united states .
übereinandergelagert up on the erdräumlichen image of nasa .
now let &apos;s take something else .
this is now live on the internet . you can nachprüfen it .
this is a project called photosynth , which connects really two different technologies together .
one is seadragon , and the other is a very good research about computervision , which is a universitätsstudenten snavely , in the university of noah , under the advice of steve seitz .
and rick szeliski from microsoft research was done by microsoft research . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by seadragon .
you can see that if we can penetrate this kind of view of view where we can penetrate through images and make this experience of mehrfachen resolution .
but the spatial length of the images is actually meaning .
the computervision-algorithmen , together , these pictures , they &apos;ve got the real space in which these images that are all done to the grassi lakes in the kanadischen rockies in the canadian rockies , you can see the elements of stabilisierten slides or panoramischer bildverarbeitung , and these things have been set up to each in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i &apos;ve got time to show you other environments .
there &apos;s a lot of räumlicher .
so , i &apos;d like to take one of the most of the originalen datensätze , and this is from a very early prototype of photosynth that we &apos;ve been working on in summer to show you that what i think is really the punchline behind this technology , which is photosynth-technologie , and this isn &apos;t necessarily obvious , if you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers , etc .
this is a rekonstruktion of the cathedral , and there &apos;s , in the computer with flickr of flickr of flickr on the computer in the computer with flickr , and you &apos;ll just give pictures of men in t-shirts and on the universitätsgelände , and so on , and each of these orange evidence represents a picture that was discovered as this model .
so this is all flickr-bilder , and they &apos;re all in context in relation to each other .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i ended up working on microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the head here .
i guess you can see that this is many different kinds of cameras : it &apos;s all about the handy-kamera to professional slrs , a pretty large number of you who are all zusammengeflickt in this environment .
and as possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the weird ones .
many of them are verdeckt on faces .
there &apos;s a series of photographs here -- here you are .
this is actually a poster from the notre lady that was really recorded .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , and we &apos;re all collected data from all -- from the whole collective of it , like this , visual the earth -- and everything is going to connect .
all these photographs are being connected , and there &apos;s something bigger than the sum of the parts of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all over the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen stephen lawlers earth .
and this is something that people use to use with the complexity that people use it , and it &apos;s going to use its use for the user .
their own photos are going to come up with metadaten to a different person .
if someone has the trouble , and that tells you all of these saints , and you can use when you &apos;re going to use all of this data , and i can use them as a starting point to go into this room , into these metaverse , the photos of other people , and so a kind of übergreifender modaler of social experience with the use of other anbietern .
and of course , nebenprodukt of all of these are the huge virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not only given by überflüge or images and so on , but collective memory .
thank you .
i understand it right ? your software allows you to be in a certain point in the next years , within the next years , all the images that are used to be used by somebody in the world &apos;s principle ?
yeah . it doesn &apos;t matter anything else .
if you want to make it hyperlinks between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting , if you think about the fülle information that has a lot of these images .
as if you do a websuche for pictures , where you run sentences and the text of the website , a lot of information has a lot of information about it is .
but how would it be if the picture it with all your pictures ?
then the scope of the semantischen querverbindung , and the abundance that makes it , really enormous . it &apos;s an classic netzwerkeffekt .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . herzlichen .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book that i hope , in harmony with other things that you &apos;ve heard already , and i &apos;m going to try and make yourself a few connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed these .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official dogma . &quot;
the official dogma of what ?
the official glaubenssatz of all western industrialized societies .
the official dogma works like that , if our goal is that &apos;s the common part of our citizens , it &apos;s all about the maximierung of the individuals .
the reason for this is that freedom in itself is good , valuable , sense , a unverzichtbare premise for human .
when people have freedom , each one of us is for themselves to do the things that we maximize , and nobody has to decide for us .
the way of freedom to maximize freedom is choice .
the more freedom of people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom you have , the more common you have .
so this is , i think , i think , as deep in our water would come to question to question it .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us possible progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say a little bit about salatdressing .
there &apos;s 175 dressings in my supermarket , if you can &apos;t mitzählen those 10 extra olivenöle , and 12 balsamico-essig you could buy to make a large number of your eigenen dessings , in the unlikely case , that none of the 175 is right in the store for you .
so this is what the supermarket is .
and then they go to the verbraucher-elektronik business on a stereo -- speaker , cd-player , a kassetten-player , radio , verstärker , verstärker . and in this one electronics , there are so many stereo facilities .
we can have 6.5 million different assets from the components that are offered in this one business .
you have to admit that this is a great choice .
in other fields -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , because you could have all of the phone on the day , as long as long , and as long bell .
they rented her phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
now , we have an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- mp3-player- , nasen-haar-trimmer and crème brûlée .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that until now in your business , you can be sure that you will soon be .
and what it does is it makes people walk into the business and put this question .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , which are very much more bedeutsamer than buying objects , the same explosion of the choice is .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , we could make a piece or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a has got these benefits and risks and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
and the result is -- we call it &quot; patients autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift of responsibility to someone who knows something about a little bit of people who knows and most likely to be sick and likely to be sick , and that &apos;s why not in the best constitution is to make a decision -- namentlich the patient .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for people like you and me , if you &apos;re thinking about it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they operate around us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the answer is , they expect to call the doctor in the next morning , and to ask a change .
something like our identity is now a question of the choice is to be a question of how this slide is to show .
we don &apos;t erben identity ; we invent it .
and we &apos;re oft ourselves as often as we want .
that means that every day , if you wake up the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard-annahme was , that almost everybody had one , and they could as quickly as they could , and then they got kids as fast as they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
today , everything is easy .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re engaged with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i get married or not ? should i get married ?
should i get married later ? should i have children , or do you make a career ? &quot;
these are all einnehmende questions .
and you &apos;ll answer these questions , whether this means to do all the tasks that i &apos;m going to get to you and not a good note in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to beantwortende questions .
work -- we &apos;ve been blessed , as carl shows , with the technology that allows us every minute of every time on the planet to work on the planet -- until the randolph hotel .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way that i &apos;m not going to tell you about , that the wirelesslan works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions , again , again , again and again , if we should work or not work .
we can look at our kids at football , and we &apos;ve got our mobile phone on this one of the hip hip , and our back of other hip to other , and our laptop , probably on our own lap .
and even if you &apos;re all off , every minute in which we &apos;re verstümmeln , every minute in our child &apos;s child , we ask , &quot; should i accept this call ? &quot;
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even when the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be the experience of your child &apos;s experience very different than it was .
everywhere we look , big things and small things and lifestyle things , life is a question of choice .
and the world we lived in the world .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in which we live now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects of people .
an effect , paradoxer way , is that it &apos;s lähmt rather than free .
with so many options you can choose , it makes people really hard to decide .
and i &apos;m going to give you another drastisches example , a study about investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to investitions-akten of vanguard , the giant fondgesellschaft of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 investmentfonds that was the company anbot , took the participation to two percent .
they offer 50 investmentfonds -- 10 percent less employees are taking part of them as if they only offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investmentfonds , which are the choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide which to choose to choose it in tomorrow .
and then tomorrow and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course never comes .
you know , this is not only means that people have to eat food food , when they go to ruhestand , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go down , which means that they make decisions so hard that they are missing their company .
by not participation , they &apos;re not spending to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the arbeitsgeber who would be happy to replicate their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it &apos;s worried that the world looks like this .
they want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s the last , right ?
they don &apos;t want to pick up the wrong investment , or the wrong salatdressing .
so this is an effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome paralysis and make a decision , we end up with less pleased with the outcome of choice , as if we had the opportunity to decide more than less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
and so one of you know , by being able to take a different choice , and it &apos;s not a perfect thing , and what happens is that you can &apos;t have a different decision , and what happened is that you can have a different decision , and what happens is that you could have a different decision , and what &apos;s going to happen is that you feel negative , and this is what you feel negative that you have made of your actions , even if it was a good decision .
the more possibilities there is , the more that there is nothing to regret it is so disappointing for the choice they meet .
secondly , what economists call oppertunitätskosten .
dan gilbert has made a big point in this morning by telling how much the way that we do things , depends on what we compare it .
well , if there &apos;s lots of alternatives to think , it &apos;s just a dynamic properties of traits that you throw away , that makes you feel less with the alternatives that you chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorker , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what they should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of them .
very expensive property .
beautiful beach . great day . you &apos;ve got it all for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my manhattener neighborhood is gone .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and he &apos;s spent two weeks from the thought that he &apos;ve missed the opportunity to have missed a great lot of parking day .
oppertunitätskosten , the happiness we get through our choice , even if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more possibilities there are the choices , the more attractive properties of these selection will take into oppertunitätskosten .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon is some aussagen .
he makes a statement about it right now , and perhaps to do things slowly .
but an important point that he &apos;s doing is : always who you decide for one thing you don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things like lots of attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re going to do less powerful .
third : eskalation for expectations .
this has met me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in just the jeans of a way , and they bought them , and they were doing bad , they were incredibly unkomfortabel , and if they were using them for a long time , and they had lost them long enough , they started &quot; ok &quot; ok .
so to get new jeans to buy new jeans after many years of the tragens of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the sales person said , &quot; do you want to be schlanke , easily anliegende or long ?
do you want the buttons buttons or reißverschluss ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you want to cut down too far , kegelig , blah blah blah , &quot; and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way that the only way that . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour all of these damn jeans , and come down the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best jeans i &apos;ve ever had .
i &apos;d better . all of these choices allowed me to have better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it myself .
the reason that i felt worse was that i felt worse , with all those available opportunities , my expectations of what a good few jeans is , went up .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have a concrete expectations when there was only in a way .
when they came in 100 species , verdammt , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i was expected to do , and what i was expected , and what i had was disappointing to what i expected .
and we add ways of opportunities to people &apos;s lives in the lives of people , the expectation of people who have to be able to be good about how well these possibilities .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of marketings knows this , because if you were , you don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that that used to be better than everything was worse than anything was worse , it was possible for people to make a pleasant surprise .
now , in the world we live in -- we live , wealthy , developed , developed citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best you can ever do is things as well as well as you expect .
they &apos;ll never be pleasant überrascht. because their expectations , my expectations , are haushoch .
the secret to the glücklichkeit -- that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all come to -- the secret to glücklichkeit are low expectations .
i want to say -- a quick autobiographischer moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t niedergelassen myself .
but niederlassen is not always a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of a schlecht of a bad , if you &apos;re left , and you ask to wonder why is responsible , and you know , the answer is responsible . what would you have done ?
if hundreds of different kinds of stuff are available , and you buy one that &apos;s so disappointing , and you ask why who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is , you .
they could have done better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in schaufenster , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions , and even if the results of decisions are good , you feel good about it , you &apos;re beschuldigen yourself .
clinical depression exploded in the last generation in the last generation .
i think a signifikanter -- not the only one , but a signifikanter beiträger of the depression -- not the only one , but you know , you know , you know , people are so high because their standards are so high , and then if they have to explain these experiences themselves , think it would be their fault .
and so the bilanzergebnis is that we &apos;re doing better , in general , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dogma that we &apos;re all holding for right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that a little choice is better than , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choice is better than some choice .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point of a long time to the choice of the choice .
now , as a rule question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a rule question , the thing about thinking about this , which is what all of these choices enables in the industrialized societies is the material of wealth .
there are a lot of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of you , whose problem is not too big choice .
your problem is you have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry is : steve levitt has told you yesterday about how these more expensive and hard car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that this expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help you .
they even hurt .
they worry about that we are worse .
if something from what the people of our society allow decisions to make decisions to the societies where people have shifted to some choice of choice , not only the lives of people &apos;s lives , but we would also be improved .
economists call this a pareto-verbesserungs application .
einkommensumverteilung is going to make it all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big selection .
finally , please read this cartoon , you know , a general person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this goldfischglas . &quot;
verarmten imagination , a kurzsichtige view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to think of the fish that knows something .
because the truth is that if you break the goldfischglas , so everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the goldfischglas , so everything is possible , you get your happiness .
they raise the paralysis and reduce the happiness .
everybody needs a goldfischglas .
this is almost limited to complete security -- perhaps for the fish , definitely for us .
but the abhanden is a metaphor of elend , a recipe for misery , and i suspect disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects before the human genome and what that could mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
we actually start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code in a new phase of biology by building new life and building new life .
we always tried to ask significant questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something that i think many biologists to understand , and that &apos;s on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried several ways to simplify it up to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve digitized almost 20 years . when we sequenced the humangenom , the transition from the analog world of biology to the digital world of biology .
now we try to ask whether we can regenerate or do we make new life , from this digital universe ?
this is a map of a little organism , mycoplasma geitalium geitalium , who &apos;s the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do it with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it to about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that &apos;s here .
but if we look at this metabolische map , which is very simple , compared to ours . trust me , that &apos;s simple , but if we all look at these genes that we can get to another one after another one , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to the front of this chromosome , in fact , in fact , what allows us to actually vary individual components , and so some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started thinking about the question , can we put a chromosome ?
does it allow the chemistry to make these really big molecules that have never been done before ?
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome chromosome is just a piece of inertes chemical material .
our steps in the united states was exponentially .
and our ability to write genetic code has become very slowly , but still increased , and our last point would now be on an exponential curve now .
we started it 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years starting with a bioethischen review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out to be very hard .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world to make the little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters , but it &apos;s a degenerativer process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put these little pieces and correct the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome of the genome .
it &apos;s a small virus of bacteria .
we made small pieces , and they made a dna molecule and had a dna molecule about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came to when we took this piece of inerte chemical , and we gave it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then freigegeben by the cells , and they came back and killed e. e. .
so recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said that model this model .
they laughed more than her here .
so we think that this is a situation in the software that can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole bakterielles chromosome . we wanted to build an entire bakterielles chromosome . so we thought we &apos;re building it in the size of the size of the virus that we could vary the size of the kassetten to understand what the individual components of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you &apos;re going to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information needs to be completely accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the fehlerrate was at a mistake of a mistake .
we found 30 mistakes , when we used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to make pieces that are 50 letters long letters for the 50 letters long letters long letters , in order to make a little sub-einheiten that they fit together .
we have a unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have waterzeichen .
think about this : we have a 4-buchstaben code : a , c , g and thomas
triplets of these letters -- these letters kodieren about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
at the beginning , we only signed .
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry .
we &apos;ve designed the pieces that we could just take them apart with enzymes , and there are enzymes that can fix these and together .
and we have started making pieces , starting with the five to siebentausend letters , they put these together together , in order to zusammenzufügen these together , to 72.000 them .
in every step we have these pieces of these pieces of these things that we could sequence them , because we were trying to create a very robust process of what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point .
so , this looks like a basketball-playoff .
if we get to these really big bits -- over 100,000 basenpaaren -- and then they &apos;re not going to grow in e. of modern biology , which is beyond all the possibilities of modern biology , and so we applied to other mechanisms .
we knew from a mechanism of homologe rekombination rekombination , which is using biology to repair dna that can build these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s one organism called deinococcus radiodurans of the three million wheel of radiation .
you see in the upper field that its chromosome just falls apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything came up like this .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be completely ausgetrocknet , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life is in space and move , looking for aquatischen conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot out there .
here &apos;s a gefügeaufnahme of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve been using hefe-mechanismen with the right design of the right design of the pieces , we have eingepasst them . yeast puts them together .
this is not a elektronenmikroskopaufnahme mikroskopaufnahme .
it &apos;s a big molecule that we can actually see it with the lichtmikroskop .
these are footage over a duration of six seconds .
that &apos;s the paper we &apos;ve just done recently .
this is about 580.000 letters of genetischem code , and it &apos;s the biggest molecule that has ever been created by people .
it has a molekulargewicht of over 300 million .
if we put it up with a schriftgröße of 10 and without distances , it would be 142 pages , just around this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s a very simple one , it &apos;s very simple . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier when you &apos;re doing it , and you &apos;re going to do it , you just take the core out and there &apos;s another place , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about this cloning .
in archaebakterien , the chromosome is in the cell , but only recently we showed that you can do a complete transplant on a chromosome to another one from a cell to another one .
we &apos;ve got the chromosome of this chromosome . we &apos;ve been able to zerstören this chromosome , and we &apos;ve got to destroy this chromosome , and we &apos;ve been able to destroy this chromosome to zerstören all of the proteins , and it was very amazing than we put it in a cell -- and you &apos;ll estimate our very ausgereiften visual .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to make a little further .
this is the hauptmechanismus of evolution here .
we find all sorts of species here that have a second chromosome or a third chromosome of irgendwoher , every thousands of characteristics in only one second of a species .
so people who think about evolution as a gene is going to be changed at a moment of biology .
there are enzymes called the restriktionsenzyme , which are actually verdauen dna .
the chromosome in the cell was no ; the chromosomes that we put together .
it was exprimiert in the cell and recognized the other chromosome as foreign materials material , and so we just had a cell with a new chromosome .
it verfärbte blue because of the genes that we put .
and after a very brief time , there was all the characteristics of species , and konvertierte completely into a new species based on the new software that we have in the cell .
all of the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we transferiert .
it may sound like green alchimie , but we can change the software-dna , things really change .
now i argumentiert that this is not the genesis -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years .
and i argued that that we might be able to build a new form of the prefrontal explosion in which there could be a massive new artenbildung based on this digital design based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re anzuwachsen up to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet has been in 1946 , within 40 years , within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for common billion people .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 30-plus billion barrels of oil , that &apos;s a hundred million barrels a day .
when we think about biological processes or any process of a process to replace this , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the carbon co2 from this material in the atmosphere .
we &apos;ve now , from our discoveries all over the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the designkomponenten of the future .
the elektronikindustrie had a dozen components , and you see the diversity of this .
we &apos;re in first line from the limits of biological reality , and those of our imagination .
we have these technologies today because of these fast synthesemethoden , to do what we call kombinatorische genetics .
we &apos;ve now created a large robot to build the millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine to make these 20 million different kinds of different genes , or to optimize those 20 million of vaccines or drugs , or drugs , new vaccines , we can change a little bit more biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just nurmale selection . we can go to lebensfähigkeit selektieren , production of chemicals or treibstoffproduktion and so on .
this is a shot of real design-software that we &apos;re actually working with , and we &apos;re actually designing new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it looks like , we know exactly what the genetic code will look like .
we &apos;re now focusing on loss of the fourth generation .
you &apos;ve recently seen corn ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we have fuels of the zweiten- and third generation that will have been going to have much higher zuckerwertigkeiten , like oktan or different kinds of butanol .
but how we think the only way of biology is going to have a big impact without the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost or the limitation of their availability , when we look at co2 as a material , and therefore we &apos;re working on the cells .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first generation with treibstoffen of the fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is a organism we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about ein-einhalb miles deep , in almost kochenden wassertemperaturen .
it uses co2 co2 in methane to use of hydrogen as a source of energy .
we &apos;re exploring if we can use carbon co2 , which could be easy to be brought to produktionsplätzen , the co2 in fuel to run this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- moderate goals like the ersatz of the entire petrochemischen industry . right . so , if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where else is to be a hauptquelle of energy .
but as well , we &apos;re working on right now , the same approaches for building vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen it this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year , and you have a dollar , if it comes to the right vaccine .
and i think that &apos;s going to be changed by rekombinante vaccines .
that &apos;s what the future might look like with changes , can be accelerated today with synthetic bacteria , archaen , and perhaps eukaryonten .
we are entfernt years of improving people better . our goal is that we have a chance to survive for a long enough to survive . thank you very much .
on the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to tell you how the machine works .
so it &apos;s that way . and for all those days , the lhc were not there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that has ever been made -- 27 miles across the diameter .
its job is to create the conditions that are less than a milliardstel second after the universe -- and that up to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take images of these mini-urknalle in detectors .
i &apos;m at this work . it &apos;s called the atlas detector detector -- 44 feet in the diameter , 22 feet in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of atlas in the construction so that you see the scale .
on the 10th last year , the machine went to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it caused huge jubel in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first strahlenpartikels that the lhc around the lhc , then , in order to make a part of the lhc , to make an rain of particles from particles to the detector .
in other words , when we saw this image on the 10th of september , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was erzeugte the largest jubel , or that when somebody went to the google side and found the front page so found .
it means that we reached an cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with this wires .
these wires lead 13-tausend ampere when the machine is on hochleistung .
well , the engineers among you will look at them and say , &quot; no , they don &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford this , because if you get it very far , you will become something like supraleitern .
so at minus 271 degrees , cooler than the space between the stars , these wires can sustain tension tension .
in one of the connections , between neuntausend magnet in the lhc , there was a manufakturdefekt .
and then heat down the wires and 13-tausend ampere , suddenly elektrischem resistance .
this was the result .
now , this is what it &apos;s a wonderful thing , when you imagine that the magnet weigh over 20 tons and shifted to about 30 inches .
so we extract about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we did .
we konditionierten them , reparierten them .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
at the end , the lhc will be funktionsfähig again .
we &apos;re going to turn it up , and expect to take the first data on june or of july , and they &apos;re going to take the journey to figure out what the building blocks are the universe .
well , of course , in a kind of entfachen these accidents , these accidents about the value of science and ingenieurskunst on like this . it &apos;s easy to reject this .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to do the fact that we reach beyond our limitations , is the value of things like the lhc .
and i &apos;m going to leave the nutzlosen experiments of his lehrlings , his apprentice , who i guess , when he had the nutzlosen experiments of the development of the human mind , to assume that our scientific ideas are good for that there &apos;s no mystery in nature that our triumphe are vollzählig , and that there are no new worlds . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
to write books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , life and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change .
but the recent thing is a little bit weird in my life and my career , which has brought me to think about this work completely .
this strange event was that i &apos;ve written a book recently -- a biography called „ eat , pray , love “ -- that , unlike all of my previous books for some of some reasons in the world , and a big mega-ereignis , international bestseller-ding .
the result is that i don &apos;t matter where i &apos;m going to be treated as i &apos;m going to be treated .
seriously -- the untergang !
for example , they &apos;re very concerned to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that success will never be übertreffen ?
don &apos;t have a fear of all their life , and never created a book that anyone cares in the world ? never again ?
okay , that &apos;s really the courage .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago , when i was a teenager for the first time , when i was the first time to be a writer , i wanted to be confronted with the same kind of angstbesetzter response .
people said , „ , don &apos;t you fear , never succeed ?
do you have no fear that &apos;s a absage ?
don &apos;t you worry that you &apos;re going to live your life for your life , and you never come into it , and you &apos;re going to die on a schrotthaufen geplatzter dreams -- your mouth , your mouth full of failure ?
so about , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : „ yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had .
and i &apos;ve got a lot more afraid that no one was going to find .
like algae -- and other furchteinflößende things .
but if it &apos;s about writing about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it for more recently , why ?
is that rational ?
is it logical that it should be expected to be afraid that he was afraid of doing the work he feels ?
and what &apos;s going on is going on with the creative enterprise that they make us insecure about the other quality of mortality -- in a way , how does other jobs do not do ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can &apos;t remind myself at the situation in his 40 years as a chemist , remember if he was afraid to be a chemist .
with your chemiker-blockade , john -- how do you do it ?
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists did not get the call of alkoholsüchtigen manisch-depressive people .
we may seem to have that kind of call , but not only have the writers , but the creative of all genres , they seem to have this call to be mentally tremendously unstable .
all you need to do is to look at the bitteren todeszahlen from the 20th century from the 20th century , who died young and often died of their own hand .
and even those who didn &apos;t actually have their own suizid , seemed to be neglected by their talent .
norman mailer said shortly before his last interview , „ each of my books have killed me a little bit further .
a extraordinary statement that you can do about your work .
but we wouldn &apos;t even be able to hear somebody like this , if we &apos;re going to hear somebody like this kind of a long time , because we &apos;ve been able to know the notion of work and collective , that creativity and suffering , of course , that creativity and that art -- at the end of the end , always .
the question i want to ask you today is : is this idea for you all right ?
do you know ? because with only one centimeter , i don &apos;t feel like that at all .
i find it abscheulich .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch it in the next century .
i think it better when we encourage our great creative creative .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation -- in my situation -- very dangerous , in my situation , the dark path of the idea of the idea -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career i &apos;m in my career right now .
that means -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 arbeitsjahre in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now from the world is going to be the work that &apos;s going to be the abgefahrenen success of my last book , was right ?
i say it geradeheraus , because we &apos;re now all of these friends -- it &apos;s most likely that my biggest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
this is the kind of thoughts that you can get someone to drink at 9 o &apos;clock in the morning and i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;d rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of the reflektierens , it seems to me that i can continue to create a kind of schützendem psychological study .
somehow , i have to find a way of writing a safe distance between me and my very natural beklemmung about how the reaction is going to be on the writing .
and as i &apos;ve been looking for models in the past year , to find this , i &apos;ve been looking for the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they might have better or more powerful ideas about that than we can help , as we can be able to deal with the emotional risks that are connected to creativity .
this quest led me to old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will end up again .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of göttlicher diener-geist , which was from a distant , unknown source to people -- from unerklärlichen , unknown reasons .
the greeks were calling these göttlichen diener-geister of creativity dämonen .
by socrates , he was known that he believed he had a dämon who mitteilte it from ferne .
the roman one had the same idea , this kind of körperlosem creative mind called a „ genius .
this is great . the roman didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they thought a genius was this kind of magical göttliches creatures , that it was literally living in the walls of a künstlerateliers -- something like dobby , the hauself -- the rauskäme and the artists in the work in a sense of life is invisible and making the outcome of work .
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s a distance that i talked about -- the psychological forms that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everyone knew that it worked , right ?
the artist of the altertums was protected certain things , like , for example , too much narzissmus , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew that you had this körperlose genius that helped you .
if your work floppte -- not entirely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew your genius was paralyzed .
so the people in the west have been thinking about creativity .
and then the renaissance came and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- about all the gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no room for a mystic creatures that are orders from the divine .
and it &apos;s the beginning of rational and the people started to think that creativity came completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , people will hear this or a genius -- instead of that he has a genius .
i have to tell you : i think that was a big mistake .
you know , if you know , you know , you know , or it &apos;s like the essence and the essence , and the essence of all , and the source , creative , unbekanntem , endless mysteriums , is a little bit too much responsibility to a lot of responsibility , human psyche .
it &apos;s like somebody to eat the sun .
this entstellt and verzerrt whole egos , and it creates all these unerreichbaren expectations of success .
i think this erfolgs-druck our artists in the last 500 years has vernichtet .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
perhaps a ancient understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just auslöschen it for 500 years in a 18-minütigen talk .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience who are really berechtigte scientific doubt about the notion of -- basically -- feen , the people nachfolgen , and so on their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question that i want to say is : why not ?
why not thinking about this ?
because it makes sense as much as anything else i &apos;ve heard about when it went to explain the absolutely crazy machende of the creative process .
a process that &apos;s -- like everybody knows it has ever been trying to make something -- in other words , in fact , everyone here -- it &apos;s not always sensible .
in fact , he can sometimes feel paranormal .
and i had a close of the extraordinary american poet ruth stone stone ruth , who was now traf , but she told me that she was growing up when she was growing up in the fields , and she said , she was working on the fields , she said she would feel and hear a poem about the landscape on them .
she said it would be like a donnernder train .
that &apos;s about the country on her country .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet .
she knew that she was just going to do a moment , and that was -- in her words -- „ race like the devil “ .
she ran like the devil &apos;s house as she went from this poem at this poem , and it was just about that enough enough to get to a piece of paper and a pen , so you could capture it with it through them , to capture and capture on the sheet .
it was not very fast . she ran , and she ran , and she ran , and she walked through her house , and she did it . she said it would go to the land and -- as she said -- „ after another poet .
and then there were these moments -- the part i never forget -- she said that there were moments where they were almost missed it .
so , she runs up to the house and looking for the paper , and she &apos;s going to go through it , just when it comes through them , and then -- she said -- it was as if it was going to reach with your other hand and get it .
and she caught the poem in his tail , and he pulled back in her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
and in these opportunities , the poem was einwandfrei and intact on paper -- but backwards -- the last word for the first .
so when i heard that , i was creepy -- this is exactly how my creative process is happening .
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a maultier . to work , i have to get up every day at the same time and sweat , abmühen and really awkward durchquälen .
but even in my maultierart , sometimes , sometimes this thing , sometimes .
and i guess many of you have done that .
and i had work or ideas that i actually can &apos;t identify from a source of me , which i can &apos;t really identify .
what is this one thing ?
and how do we get to lose with this without losing our minds , but to keep ourselves in the opposite of health ?
for me , the best living example of how to create this one of the musicians , tom waits . i was allowed to interview it for a few years ago .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of his life was tom the embodiment of the gepeinigten modern artist who was trying to get these unkontrollierbaren creative impulse that lived in him and do with them with them .
but then he got older and calm . he told me that he &apos;d go one day in los angeles , and that &apos;s all for him .
he went up with high speed when he suddenly hear a little fragment of a melody of a melody , it &apos;s hard to be greifbar , and he wants to have it . it &apos;s prachtvoll . he &apos;s prachtvoll after that , but he can &apos;t believe it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he has no kassettenrekorder .
so he starts to come up with this old beklemmung in him , like „ i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i will be followed by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough ; i don &apos;t do it .
but instead of geraten , he just heard .
he ended all the thoughts and did something completely new .
he looked up in the sky and he said , „ , can &apos;t you see that i &apos;m going to drive car ?
so i look like this as if i write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a günstigeren moment when i care about you .
if you don &apos;t , quäle today .
go und cohen cohen cohen .
his whole arbeitsprozess has changed after that .
not the work itself . it &apos;s continued to be as dark as ever .
but the process and the severe beklemmung that has around him was more , when he was das , where he was not doing anything like in trouble , and then where he came up with , and he realized that it &apos;s not a verinnerlichtes thing .
it could be a eigentümliche , wonder , bizarre , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the fremdartigen thing that was not quite tom .
when i heard this story , it also has a little bit of the way i worked , and it &apos;s been saved me .
and this idea saved me when i was in the mitten of „ eat , pray , love “ , and i fell in the middle of the zweifels of zweifels , when we &apos;re working on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you start to think it &apos;s going to be a disaster . this is going to be the worst book ever written .
not only bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just einstampfen the project .
but then i remembered what tom was talking to the free sky , and i tried .
so i raised from the manuscript , and i talked about my comment in the direction of the empty corner of space .
i spoke loudly : „ , you know , you know , you know , i know , if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i have everything i have , invest . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to show up here and pass your proportion of deal with it .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what the hell do with it .
i &apos;m still going to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to go on the record that i was here for my part of the jobs today .
because ... in the end , it &apos;s like following , in the end , in centuries , in the deserts , in the deserts , in order to mondscheinfesten people , in order to mondscheinfesten people who were ran for hours , for hours -- to dawn to dawn .
these were always great , because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but over and over again , very rare , something special happened . one of the actors actually became überweltlich .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know that you all in your life in your life .
it was as if the time stillstehen and the dancers in a form of pforte , and he did nothing else than he ever did it before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything added together .
and all of a sudden , he seemed more human .
it was erhellt up from inside , and it &apos;s erhellt up from a göttliches fire .
as something happened then , people knew what this was . they called it in his name .
they put their hands together and they started singing : „ allah , allah , allah , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historic fußnote : when the mohren südspanien came into this practice , they took this practice , in the course of the centuries of „ allah , allah allah , allah “ , allah “ , olé “ , olé , olé , which you still hear at stierkämpfen and flamenco-tänzen .
if a performer in spain , something impossible : „ allah : „ , olé , olé , olé , allah , allah , großartig , unfassbar , you know , that &apos;s a flüchtiger look at god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
but , the tricky part of the next morning , when the dancers wake up and realize that it &apos;s 11 in a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer a fünkchen of god in it .
it &apos;s just a alternder sterblicher with schmerzenden knee , and maybe he will never rise to these heights again .
and maybe somebody &apos;s going to call god &apos;s name when he turns around , but what does he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the schmerzhaftesten korrekturen of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be that full of pein if you didn &apos;t believe that , if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects remember .
if you just believe that you &apos;re a loan -- from a unvorstellbaren source of your life of your life that &apos;s passed on somebody else when you &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and i think in the last months , while i was working on the book , it will seem soon -- as the dangerous , frightening , scary , a lot of the most expected of my abgefahrenen success .
what i &apos;m constantly saying to myself , if i &apos;m crazy about it , is not fear .
not entmutigt .
just make your job .
continue to be on your contribution , whatever he might be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the dumb divine genius , which gives you to the side , decides , for a brief moment , to show a miracle of wonder through your effort , then „ olé .
and if you don &apos;t , dance dance .
and „ olé ! “ for all of this .
i believe it , and i feel that we should teach this .
„ olé ! “ for all of this , simply that you have the mere human love and the eigensinn , to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
olé !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic eiskappe , which had 10 million years the size of the bottom of the bottom states , has gone down 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t push a lot of the seriousness of this particular problem because it &apos;s not the thickness of the ice .
in some sense , the arctic eiskappe is the beating heart of our global klimasystems .
it grows in winter and the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a zeitrafferaufnahme that happened in the last 25 years .
the dauereis is labeled with red .
as you see , it grows on the dunkelblau , and this is the annual ice of the winter , and it &apos;s schrumpft in the summer .
that &apos;s called the dauereis , five years old or older , almost like blood , which out of the body here .
in 25 years , it will be gone from here .
this is a problem , because warming is the frozen reason for the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s huge amounts of gefrorenem of carbon , which , if he &apos;s auftaut from microbes to methane .
compared to the whole amount of klimaverändernden materials in the atmosphere , that amount could double when we cross this critical point .
already , in some flat , today , today &apos;s methane methane is methane from the water .
professor katey walter at the university of alaska , with another group in a different flat sea of the last winter .
wow !
you &apos;re fine . the question is , how will it ergehen us .
and one reason is , this enormous wärmespeicher erwärmt greenland from the north .
this is a jährlicher tauwasserfluss .
but the volume are much bigger than ever before .
this is the kangerlussuaq river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the sea level is rising by landeisschmelze in the ocean .
these rivers are rapide .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest eismasse on the planet .
last month , researchers signed researchers that the entire continent has now an negative eisbilanz .
and the westantarktis that &apos;s shown over a few unterwasserinseln showed up is particularly stark .
this is 20 feet meereshöhe , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the drittgrössten eismasse , they see new lakes that were a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people on the world get half of their trinkwassers from this schmelzwasser .
in the anden , this glaciers is the trinkwasserquelle for this city .
the wassermengen have been vergrössert .
but if you &apos;re versiegen , most of the water .
in california , there was a 40 percent reduction in the moment .
this is the speicherbecken .
and the predictions of how you read them are serious .
this austrocknung in the world leads to a dramatic increase of fire .
and the disasters around the world have really been zugenommen in a really ausserordentlichen and never zugenommen .
so many times over the last 30 years in the last 30 years .
this is a completely unhaltbares entwicklungsmuster .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it anrichtet .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of carbon tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific , from the american continent western and beiderseits of the indian subkontinents , where there is a dramatic drop of oxygen in the sea .
the biggest one factor for global warming , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the nevertheless biggest problem .
the united states are one of the two largest verschmutzer , together with china .
and the suggestion was to build many other kohlefabriken .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that have taken up in the last few years with some green alternatives that were proposed .
trotzdessen is a political argument in our country .
and the kohleindustrien and ölindustrien , have spent a viertelmilliarde dollars last kalendarjahr , spent clean clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this image reminded me about something .
around christmas went around christmas , in tennessee , in tennessee , a billion tons of kohleschlamm .
you saw it warscheinlich in the news .
this is in our entire country of the zweitgrösste of america .
this happened christmas christmas .
one of the ads of the kohleindustrie for christmas was this .
frosty is a vergnügter , happy kid .
it &apos;s in skin and abundance in america , and it helps our economy to grow .
frosty , the kohlenmann is a clean every day .
it &apos;s affordable and liebenswert , and workers stay in lohn and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful bergarbeiter is the ladder of massey coal .
let me tell you a very clear . al gore , nancy nancy pelosi pelosi , harry reid , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection started to live .
this is one part of her .
in the coalergy , we see climate as a serious danger for our business .
and that &apos;s why we set up to the top zeil , to spend a significant geldsumme on the way to get the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and smells of it &apos;s good .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate .
let &apos;s leave it quiet .
saueber coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean kohlefabrik .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the green kohletechnologie .
and yet , the burning of coal is the burning of one of the main reasons for the global warming , the remarkable warming that you see here , changes everything .
look at it right , this is today , clean kohletechnologie .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that actually connects these together is our dependence on kohlenstoff-basierenden fuels like dirty fuels and ausländisches &apos;s oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us from this misslichen .
versorge america with 100 percent clean electricity within the next 10 years in the next 10 years .
a plan to get america back to work to make us secure and help to stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
versorge america . find more .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a neuversorgung of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence from old , dirty fuels that ersticken our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create good for jobs .
versorge america . it &apos;s time time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
we need to come far and fast .
thank you .
i want to start with you , in the time of your childhood when you were playing with bauklötzen .
while they realized how to get rid of their hands and zugreift , the klötze and moved , they actually learned to be thinking and to understand problems and change the way to solve connections .
spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
so as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of the way of our interaction with real objects , and my colleague , with my real arbeitsfläche , i began to wonder , what if we were going to use computers , which is what if we &apos;re going to use a digital fingerspitze on a flat system -- -- what if we could intervene with both of them , if we could take data , you know , how we want it ?
and this question was so emotional that we decided to answer the answer and siftables .
in short , a siftable is an interactive computer in the size of a kekses .
you can move to your hand , you can perceive each other , you can detect your movements , and you have a screen and you can have a screen .
more importantly , you &apos;re physically , why you can only move out of bauklötze through the hands of your hands and access .
and the siftables are an example of a new generation of hilfsmitteln to the manipulation of data .
and when these resources are going to develop , and a consciousness for their movements , each other recognize each other , and the intricacies of our umgangs , you can see , we can start with the exploration of new interaktionsarten .
i start with some simple examples .
this siftable is for the videowiedergabe konfiguriert , and when i put it into a direction , the video will play forward ; if i put it into the other direction , it runs backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
so if i put them next to side , they make interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by voneinader , you &apos;ll notice that and you can get a little nervous .
and they are also feeling their movements and propensity .
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to see was that we could use gestures from data , like how colors do this with the box .
in this case , we have three siftables as a farbtöpfe konfiguriert , and i can use them to gießen color in the middle where they &apos;re going to mix .
if we übertreiben it , we can zurückschütten a little bit .
there are also some nice opportunities in education like languages languages , math or logikspiele , where we give people the possibility of fast trial and want to see immediately .
this is me -- this is a series of numbers that i make with a simple gleichungsprogramm .
this is a game with words that is a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle .
basically , you get round up every round of you at random zugewiesene letters , and while you &apos;re trying to form words , you &apos;re going to get a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s gemischt , and you have a new buchstabenkombination and new opportunity .
thank you .
these are a few kids who came up with a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to try and get a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting situation in this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is , &quot; form &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another few people test it .
this is our youngest beta-tester down there on the right .
it turns out he just wanted the siftables .
so for him , they were just bauklötze .
this is an interactive trickfilmanwendung .
we wanted to develop a lernmittel for sprachlerner .
this is felix .
he can bring new characters into the scene by aufhebt the siftable from the table to aufhebt this character .
this is the sun aufgehen the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he &apos;s catching a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yeah !
if you shake the siftables , you can be able to connect the characters ...
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open and he can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example of that i &apos;ve got time to show this is a musik-sequencer for live-auftritte that we have recently developed and in the siftables as sound as sound , like führungsstimme , bass .
each one has four different variations ; you can choose which you want to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can organize into any patterns .
and you &apos;re speist them by just holding a ton-siftable on a sequenz-siftable .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filters .
you connect it to a certain tone , and then it tends to put it up .
and then more sophisticated effects like pace and volume that you use on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we start to put the führungsstimme in two sequenz-siftable in two sequenz-siftable , and that in a row , and they &apos;re adding a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now , i &apos;m going to do something like this .
and now i put together the filter the filter , so i can control the effect live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence , using the pace of one or another direction .
and now , i combine the filter with the bass ; something more expression .
i can change the sequence while it &apos;s going to change .
so , i don &apos;t have to do it in vorfeld , but it can improvise ; they can be verlängern .
and finally , i can ausblenden the whole sequence by running the lautstärke-siftable on the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excitement is to develop new mensch-computer-schnittstellen that make better to what our brains and bodies work .
and today , i had time to show you a part of this new design-welt and some of the ways that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you to the way is that we want to be on the threshold to this new generation of werzeugen to this new generation of werzeugen to digital media , which is bringing information in our world , which is our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to the conversations with you all !
yes , good afternoon .
i &apos;m glad i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
i just have to step back a little step at this , and it &apos;s busy biohacking with modern molecular biology .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been looking at biology , and i &apos;ve been looking for a few years , because i just wanted to know , because i just wanted to know , and it wanted to do even even even what i learned in the study of theoretical .
so that was my primary motivation motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to sort of get closer to the matter , like this .
and i think that the molecular biology is in general , in general , the biotechnology , all you &apos;re important about , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now it &apos;s extremely important , and even more , much more important will become in the future .
so there are things like these all the things that have changed all these genetically gentechnisch plants .
there &apos;s craig venter in the u.s.a , which is trying to make biofuel , so the gas from algae .
there &apos;s also something like , under the other things , there are also things that most people get around , which most people are not aware of , for example , who allow us to wash with 40 degrees , are also genetically gentechnisch enzymes .
and the list can continue .
and so from the interest of this technology , in this technology , i &apos;m just going to keep reingegangen .
so what hacken now ?
most of the people know , most people know it from the softwarebereich .
computer hacken , and then it &apos;s always in the media so , yes , the hackers break somewhere , and the klauen data and so on .
this is sort of very sad for the hackerszene , because it &apos;s not true what it actually started like , and what &apos;s actually like this .
and that &apos;s where the software-hacker , in the &apos; 70s , achtzigerjahren with computerbasteln , and it &apos;s also the internet .
and it &apos;s about an playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can also be a social problem , so it can also be a social problem , so it can be a frage , so , a question , and how you can do it better or how you can do better .
and it &apos;s been turned up with software , but there &apos;s also a whole bastlerszene , because there &apos;s a whole bastlerszene that makes all kinds of abgefahrenen things .
and now in the direction of biology , and i want to go from synthetic biology , that biology is actually a abstrakter code , which is that biology is actually a abstrakter code , which is yes , it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s matter , so it &apos;s real matter , and not just cyber .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it , and you can also hacken it , like this , and i find that i find incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper .
that actually has only been zweitausend eight , these networks .
there &apos;s hackteria dot , which is originally from switzerland , this is originally from switzerland , and with cooperation in india , but by now , members or active people around the world .
so that &apos;s got a lot of an artistic , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers , and there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and with scientists with scientists with these technologies with these technologies and to process that creative , and yes , and yes , all sorts of things .
but it &apos;s really always about trying to find such a lockeren access to have a commercial deal with it .
and then there &apos;s do-it-yourself-bio dot , d.i.y.bio .
this is from the u.s.a a network , which is actually more such as a forum , where you know , where you go and address online online .
these are a little bit more technological , and also a little bit more businessmäßiger on the way , and then they &apos;re asked , ja questions .
and based on these networks that have done all the popular , you &apos;ve developed a scene that i &apos;d like to just porträtieren .
here in the left on the left , you see biocurious , this is a hackerspace , so it &apos;s a kind of school , so a private school , nonprofit community facility , where everyone can get .
kids , old , old people , all kinds of people are going to go around with it , and they put a lab in the lab and look at what you can do when these laborprotokolle .
the left here is a group in indonesia in indonesia in indonesia , which means it &apos;s a long time .
more than these other two networks .
they &apos;re also concerned in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , also , elektronikbasteleien , and combine that in quite abgefahre .
a group of ankara i &apos;ve met a while ago , which is a while ago , they &apos;d like to teach the public , what they &apos;re learning in college , and they &apos;ve tried to explain little actions , and people tried to explain what d.n.a is d.n.a .
and i have a lecture in copenhagen in the other picture in copenhagen in the medical museum in the medical museum in the medical museum .
and this is , yes , it &apos;s mostly quite young people , but the only young people , but the only thing what they &apos;re all of them is this fascination of technology .
and what you can do with that , and you &apos;re just looking at society , and to ask , so , okay , what do you know what you want to do , what you want to do , have your interest in this way ?
so , o.k , to hacken biology , you kind of need stuff .
you know , of course , biological need biological materials , and you need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
and what you know , what you know , in a lab , you know , is so sort of abgefahrene machines , extremely expensive , extremely expensive , just for fachpersonal , trained academics with doktortitel and so on .
and our approach was to say , o.k , that you don &apos;t really have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary , because every one of each kaffeeautomat has actually evolved technology as most of the most sophisticated , it &apos;s really like that .
and at the point with this premise with this premise with these premise , brian degger is trying to try to do a minimallabor zusammenzustellen , and then it took a dampfdruckkochtopf , and it took a heizplatte , and , so suppenbrühe , and then it &apos;s going to work with bacteria .
so everyone who &apos;s already vergammelt a soup that he has left too long , too .
i &apos;ve tried to take that in my lab back at home , a little bit , and then put on ebay on ebay on ebay , and a little d.n.a analysis , trying to be a vaterschaftstest , so an vaterschaftstest fingerprinting , even at home .
it shouldn &apos;t really be a joke right now , but .
so in the bottom of this picture , you can see a zugestellte garage , in anführungsstrichen , which has a group , a group , which has a group in paris , a group in paris , a group in paris , which has eingerichtet , and quite successful , and pretty successful with it , and it &apos;s quite interesting things , i want to get a project a project .
and this is biocurious , which is just mentioned hackerspace , this is a kind of volkshochschule in principle for molecular biology .
and yes , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively relative , so that &apos;s a lot of people who do this home alone , to big , so far up to large organizations , which are even more formal in institutionalisierter form .
but just the approach that it is to be easy and accessible to it .
the first project we &apos;ve done as an international group , when we &apos;ve been aware of our self , we &apos;ve been aware of our ourselves as a real scene , and we are online online , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re now aware of the people who always are doing it and so .
and then , from the do-it-yourself-bio website on the founder of the founders , we &apos;ve got to be able to do this , too , too , too , you know , you know , and then two events , and then two events has organized two events , one in london , zweitausend 10 , and shortly to the u.s.a , in san francisco .
and , you know , you know , you know , o.k , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to say , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values and what are our purposes , our basis ?
and then we went out of a code-of-conduct .
that was quite intuitive , so everyone has just got his wishes , and he was , and what it was going to take , then .
and i think of my opinion , a very good code .
and that &apos;s what we have , it &apos;s not verbindlich , but this is , but this is , i think , you know , you know , pretty well , people are quite convinced of this .
and then we &apos;ve actually tried to go back in the academic world , but it &apos;s not there somehow .
so i think we &apos;re in terms of biohackerszene , even one step further than the academic world .
so , what projects do we actually do now ?
a project i did with the hackteria-netzwerk in switzerland itself was that we wanted to be an so-called optical case or optical basteln .
that &apos;s when you focus a beam on one in the room , and you can catch little particles in the air or in the liquid , and then move into that focus , so that &apos;s then stuck there , so it &apos;s just like a traktorbeamstrahl in principle .
and we &apos;ve been thinking , this is going to be done in academic setting , and we &apos;ve thought , o.k , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;ve taken a webcam , the aufgeschraubt , the lens , the lens , and then you have a microscope , you have a microscope .
you see that down there .
and then we have a d.v.d brenner and the brenner the laser laser the laser , and then tried to focus on this camera .
and it didn &apos;t work out , but we &apos;ve also learned a lot of it .
so another project that made from from the french group from paris , that worked out , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s as a hirnwellenmessgerät , so e.e.g , or something like this , so he &apos;s been working with neurobiologie , his nickname is sam neurohack .
and he built this helmet there , and he built this helmet in cooperation with the museum .
and then the visitors in the room are going to go into this chair on this chair .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they were thinking , or how they thought , is different lights in space .
it was a pretty ziemlich project project .
another thing from the united states , which is just going to do with this vaterschaftstestgeschichte , is the p.c.r , that &apos;s the polymerase-kettenreaktion , complicated word .
so , it &apos;s about copying genes , eben , d.n.a , d.n.a , they can make them visible visible .
so if i &apos;m going to take the profiler on the scene of the scene of the crime , and then they &apos;re going to take any haarproben , and then they &apos;re going to turn this way , and then they can say , o.k , this hair belongs to this human being like this .
and the machines that make something like this is quite expensive that you buy commercial , the least way that &apos;s going on at viertausend euros .
and this is not in the hobbybereich , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that &apos;s also a lot .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
and you &apos;ve got two two two two zwei , and you know , you know , the open source of the open source , and you &apos;ve got open source , elektroniksachen , you know this device , and you &apos;ve got this device now , and you &apos;re now , and you &apos;re now the most exciting anbieter of these devices of these devices worldwide .
i think it &apos;s kind of six dollars or something .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s still in a framework where it is going to be clear .
so , i think this is a very gelungener .
a project that i started recently was building a gene-gun .
gene-gun is , you know , like a kind of luftdruckpistole , it &apos;s about that far , two centimeters or something like this .
you lädt d.n.a on goldpartikel , and you put the goldpartikel into these luftdruckpistole , and then i &apos;ve got it zwiebeln , and then i got it with that .
so the device you can see that doesn &apos;t work .
but that &apos;s so my prototype my prototype , who looked like this in a branch , in such a branch , so on a branch , the thing on the thing , the thing on the ground , and that was the pressure on it , but the pressure was too high , this thing was broken .
and then i took a sahnespender and i put it on this .
a sahnespender , if you get a full of power with water , you have enough pressure , and i think so 40 to sechtzig bar .
and then you can go up and accelerate the particles , and then you go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about fünfzehntausend euros , or something like this to 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s essentially doable .
so , and this is , at the moment that you know , at the moment , is to increase this availability of technology , and also to make the information and the verständlichkeit that more people can get involved in there .
because , as at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have quite a lot of them , and also no chance to make themselves really well .
because if you read only about it , it &apos;s not the same thing that you &apos;ve done yourself , you &apos;ve seen it .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to meet as a informierter citizen in society , you want to make a good decisions in society , you need to be able to know , you need access to the knowledge .
and you also have to do it and understand it and understand it .
and then the firmiert then is the open knowledge and citizens science .
so , you can be able to be able to be able to be able to get through these scientific technologies .
and this is the kernanliegen of the biohackern .
these are the people who are at least offiziell on the website , d.i.y.bio-dot-org website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and interesting is that they &apos;re also represented in southeast asia .
that &apos;s what i think is there are fewer people there , as actually exist .
so i know about some who don &apos;t put .
and these are just the biohacker , individual people .
in part , with these hackerspaces , in part of these places , these places there .
and this is at the beginning .
as i said , zweitausendacht has just started .
and hackerspaces , so the computerhackerspaces , because the c-base in berlin was the first , neunzehnhundertfünfundneunzig .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , infrastrukturzentren , who are represented anywhere in the world .
and of course we hope , of course , we &apos;re going to get too similar , as well , as well , as well as well as people can be involved in it .
and i would invite everybody to deal with it and even what to try to try .
it &apos;s not so simple now , but it &apos;s also not impossible if you have enough curiosity , and you have enough energy , you get too far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hello .
how do we actually do people ?
this is a question that i &apos;m very moving about as a designer , but also in the realm of forschungsbereich , and in front of all the things in the field of users .
it &apos;s about how to get people in an interactive media , so they can use this interactive media and create them a very befriedigendes experience .
because i think that the interactive media is in in us , cognitive models , also , which in our biological memory , in our biological memory , that we &apos;ve been in a very long time , and that we could have just created by interactive media .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that these hochtechnologie , which you get in the future , which is actually going to bring you into the future , but actually it &apos;s that the future is right in us , in our archaischen roots .
what are actually archaische models ?
i &apos;ve got four stichworte writing , and i &apos;d like to explain .
it &apos;s the models that we have in the vorindustriellen times .
we heard to these archaischen models , we &apos;ve heard an almost natural proportion of natural proportion .
that sounds unusual .
but i &apos;m going to take you up again , and you &apos;ll prove you to try and prove that you have a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second thing is that we &apos;ve been able to be able to address models of models that are really able to talk , even though , even though we use a kodifizierte language today .
and the third area that explains itself by itself .
we all know that the interactive media &apos;s media is by definition , which includes the verneinung of non-zero-sumness , and what , of course , is that we &apos;re feeling as normal experience today today .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of informationsweitergabe .
now , as is this with virtuality , which is actually the most fundamental thing in the world .
i want to show you this .
how many doors doors has the house that you live in ?
that &apos;s not going to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s happening right now .
they go through the spirit through this house , in demn them , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
it virtualisieren the reality , and it &apos;s not a computer .
fantastic , right ?
and that &apos;s where we &apos;re interested in , for example , for example , the virtual reality , for example , we can do this all the time .
and this wealth is the virtual reality to virtualisieren the reality , the people in the other times also needed , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any fotolitografie .
they didn &apos;t have mass .
the only thing they had was her head .
and in this head , the memory played .
in this head , abgerufen , and using these virtual images , in these virtual images , had been passed on .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in us , that we can deal with virtuality so well .
so the interesting thing is , if i &apos;ve got a little trip .
yes .
so the interesting thing is that at this time , at the same time , at the same time , the human being medienproduzent and medium itself was .
now , if you &apos;re thinking a little bit further .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;ll talk about it again .
the central tool of informationsvermittlung has been in history .
schamanen , priests , so-called wissenswächter , were kind of extra turned out to keep knowledge in stories .
and also , we &apos;re very , very strong at stories .
the author of the book of des , jonathan gottschall gottschall , we still verbingen hours of geschichten hours of stories .
this means for a kid that has spent the most of the time of the most of his life , spent the most of his life .
now , we think our love stories depends on that we &apos;ve been sitting on the lap of our parents .
no , no , gefehlt .
that &apos;s a lot further back to the cultures of the vorindustriellen times .
but for me , in the realm of an interactive media , as a particularly impressive that we are in our biological memory , the ability to be nonlinear .
i brought to you an example of the nordamerikanischen tribe of the nordamerikanischen .
and life lived in the küstenregion of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very inselreiches area , and you had to sort of navigate from an island to island island to raise food .
and they &apos;ve done this with something called lead-landkarten .
you might also know that if you &apos;re a little bit about it , you know , of the australian .
they have similar principles .
they have no lead-landkarten , but they &apos;ve been using this gennanten or traumpfade .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be taken by songs songs .
and the language of untergeordnetem was known by untergeordnetem .
that means you get navigierte about sound and rhythm .
and that rhythm , and this rhythm and this rhythm , has been shown in a region , and it also enables you to put these songs and sit together and go to the left to the left , and you could go back to the left .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to come from a to b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
and that &apos;s what &apos;s happened as gennante .
we &apos;ve been going on in the so-called vogt-zeitalter .
what &apos;s happened is the age age , and what happened is the book , and this is the book .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have responsibility for our memories and the production of individual memories of individual memories on external media .
on the book and the picture .
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god from god to virtualisieren .
in virtuality , there &apos;s become alien for us , and it has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , one known to say that this mass , he &apos;s going to go to the book , and the picture , and the internet , and so on , and so on what we call a mass mass today , that these mass of our memories have been versteinert , and our ability to virtualisieren .
let &apos;s make a little zwischenbilanz .
from vogt-zeitalter to the age age .
what has affect our thinking on our thinking about our thinking ?
then the verblassenden einflüsse einflüsse of the vorindustriellen cultures .
and they &apos;re going to be more in the course of the course of the centuries more and more überschrieben by the einflüsse of the maschinenzeitalters .
that means , instead of remembering us , we have standardisierte , far , common , spread in masses of memories that we &apos;re able to have our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce anymore .
we have an abstract language .
we don &apos;t think about the thing anymore in pictures that things don &apos;t even anymore in images , but we &apos;re our language .
we &apos;ve got used to that things have been used to happen .
and we have been accepted as a law , and there are just exceptions , like the non-linearität .
what &apos;s left us is the storytelling .
again , we &apos;re very , very , very , very , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s now coming ?
we had the vogt -zeitalter , we had the age age , and we &apos;re now going to go down this called cyber-zeitalter .
it sounds very spacig , and it sounds very much like science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of cyber-zeitalters , who bring us these ways to discover our skills back to our skills .
this is about virtuality , it &apos;s about non-linearität , it &apos;s about storytelling .
i want to explain a little bit short .
there are technical concepts like the augmented reality , which is called the extended reality .
so , for example , if you look at google glasses , for example , if you look at the virtual world with the real world , it &apos;s called our affinität to the virtualisierung , which means the virtual as a little normal , natural , natural , will talk to natural .
another example is this called virtual reality .
so , of course , that &apos;s what i like , sound like my talk to my talk , where we don &apos;t move , physically in existenten , virtual worlds , very much about the model .
and others are the ambienten , smart systems .
these are rooms that can respond to people .
all of this takes the ability , our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i &apos;m in the degree and i hope that the video works , a very , very beautiful project , this is the bachelorarbeit of michael burk , ann-kathrin krenz , joris klause and jan-moritz müller .
and the two letzteren are also here today .
maybe you can get up for a second , so you can pause in the break with those two things .
and i &apos;ve brought this project as an example , again , like back to this archaischen , cognitive models .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
so , of course , which is extremely entgegenkommt and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer games , you probably have some of the eyes that any people in front of some people in front of some of them , or they play with some kind of konsole .
anyway , that you do this .
this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s what i think is that i discover the outside world , so i discover the world &apos;s real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , which is the data that we produce , which we produce with the real world .
i apologize that i &apos;m so strong .
so you can explain that much better , there &apos;s more much more behind it .
that &apos;s about that i discover a city by looking at what places are positive or negative .
and this is how i get a very different from the city of the city of the city , a very different sense , and i see negative and positive zones of a city , and i get a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can see that now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you see .
of course , this virtual world in the walls of our cities , is yes .
and with a kind of flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;d like to summarize my talk , and it &apos;s a little bit of the things that we &apos;ve done from the vogt -zeitalter , and that &apos;s where we &apos;ve got a little bit of verschütt , in the sense , in the way that we &apos;ve been going on , in the way that we &apos;ve done from the vogt , and that we have a little bit of complex , technological , new products in fact not in the future , but we actually come back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked if this bag is a sprechender bag , and i &apos;m going to talk about .
that &apos;s not going to do it .
i &apos;m going to resolve the same thing i &apos;m in there .
but so far , i &apos;m going to do it .
yes , kids are from nature , or should be curious , designers .
i &apos;m a creator of house , so i &apos;m also , of course , with the subject of the issue of curiosity , and how change the curiosity is also changing our thinking , and why we &apos;re going to lose it too curiosity and have to go again and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re doing with the actual experience as a creator .
when professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to reingeschoben reingeschoben reingeschoben .
and that &apos;s what i had last half a year .
a forschungssemester for the subject of natural user interface .
now you &apos;re going to ask , why are the whole creator of the natural , archaischen urformen of communication , interacting with interaction and so on .
and i just think one of these little devices up , because things are supposed to be more intuitive , more natural , more natural , and you have to look at , what &apos;s actually , of course , what is benutzungsfreundlich or intuitive .
and in front of the background , i have an design of design , so the next generation of the human computers in which human beings are in the relationship with a lot of people in the relationship with how our tools , or how the computer changed from the computer to the digital assistant .
so i &apos;ve been busy with it , of course , of course , or intuitive .
maybe a look again .
why does this happen ?
so if we look at the development of our society , here &apos;s a little bit , then we &apos;re going to move now from the fourth gesellschaftsgeneration or gesellschaftsform .
so in the modern computergesellschaft .
every society is shaped by a primärmedium .
at the beginning of the stammesgesellschaft through the language .
that means you &apos;ve been able to have a common language , you could be able to communicate with each other in the same cave , or in other areas , has built cities or villages , and has created nen stammesgesellschaft .
but the primärmedium was the language , something very natural , something very living .
you know , you also learn , not to talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning about it , of course .
this was then abgelöst by ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a riesen-aufschrei , because , of course , because you know , of course , it was a riesen-aufschrei language in the form of writing , which means what fluid and alive is , i start and meißele it , and i manipuliere it .
depending on as i meißel , and when i &apos;m meißel , of course , it &apos;s a very different narrative than if there &apos;s a living in a kind of life .
but then sukzessive , you know , you know , this kind of schrift .
then the next generation , in which we actually live in today .
this is just by pressure and print schrift writing and others .
in the time , it was as a affront , where adel , klerus and other people have said , are you really amazing when the people start reading , and then you want to join your hand , of course , that &apos;s totally fatal .
and now we come into the next generation and the exciting thing is , a generationswechsel is only a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really in the moment in this phänomenalen phase that we &apos;re going on .
it &apos;s totally confused to us , of course , because we see on one side of the new media , socil social media , facebook and so on .
with total transparency , what the new thinking is , you don &apos;t say that in the alte , you don &apos;t say that in the lasagne pferdefleisch and not beef beef , or other phenomena , i want to just vertuschen , and i want to kundtun .
and these two worlds just bang together , new and old thinking .
the exciting thing is , if you look at this , this new society , this new society , entlehnt , very many of many mechanisms , principles and archaischer paradigm from the stammesgesellschaft .
but now not on the local level , it &apos;s based on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the issue of ecology is a global .
not when i think local ökologisch and the neighbor thinks less ökologisch , then it doesn &apos;t work .
that is , from the local village , in fact , is a global village with the same principles , with the same principles , most of course , but the total transparency .
as you knew in the village at the time , who was in the village , who has happened to whom and when , this is what happens today about this extension of our self through these expansion of our ourselves through a global level .
it &apos;s that we know globally and faster and faster and better and better .
this is what happened to the village .
before the background , i &apos;ve been looking at what it means , because it &apos;s , of course , what we may also do is , of course , what we might also do for us , too , is instinctively , so what does the difference ?
because often people come , you can &apos;t make it benutzungsfreundlich , so everyone can handle it .
so you have to deal with this , which is , and not just to change it , that it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s supposed to be better .
and when , of course , of course , a little intuitive , and how , of course , i think , as a creator of it , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a benutzungsfreundlich , so they &apos;re very intuitive , because then they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re easy to use .
and then you know , as well , as the student , with the subject of perception and the wahrnehmungspsychologie .
and that &apos;s of course , of course , where you go and look and look and look , okay , i just look into the inner self .
and what does it look like ?
so how do we work when we reingucken ?
and what does mean , of course , is , so intuitive , and how does our channels work , and how does cognitive work works ?
because steve jobs has said , you need to dig deeper to understand how .
so you really have to look at the details when i want to make something or intuitive or intuitive , which means this is what it means .
and you can see that one of our seven senses , most of the people we think we are only five , in fact , in fact , in the near , in the near future , in the near the next , in the near future , and as an extension sense , and as an extension of our self .
and to look , how do we process information , how do we process information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
there &apos;s a lot of the word , don &apos;t know what it means and then it means .
but i &apos;ve got to understand in the core understanding in the nature , when information comes to information , when information comes to information , when become from data and from information , i know , i know , i know how to do things like that as well , or of course .
and of course , how design influence influence to perception .
and we see this when i do things , i can make it verwirrend like on the right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can make it sort of intuitive , by showing things .
so very much more natural , in a single one , but i see in a way , where it &apos;s salt salt .
and if i say to someone , please give me salt or pepper , he &apos;ll be able to look at the right first , where is what &apos;s inside .
and in the left with the left , and then hopefully , and then i hope that there &apos;s no sugar is in there , the salt .
but also our perception of ourselves , how does they make us .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the little , although it &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s the same size , and yet , our perception , depending on what the context we do .
anybody know what this is ?
come on .
pattern recognition should work .
there &apos;s some more likely to be in my glasses .
so it &apos;s &apos; n circle .
a second circle is beginning to relate or associate certain .
and then if i have a halboval , we don &apos;t just look at a single one more , which is a circle of a circle , and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see more three parts , a circle , a circle , another .
this is called gestaltgesetz or eben , which also affect us in perception .
it &apos;s important for the creator , which is the most part of the time , the great gestaltgesetze .
gestaltgesetz near , the continuity of the continuity and so on .
and so often forget in the third .
but it &apos;s essential an essential component , if you want to design things very well .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting is that .
it &apos;s very simple , but it &apos;s very exciting when you &apos;re closer to it .
so we have the front of the eyes , and now you think , we &apos;re looking at the front of the front .
that &apos;s wrong .
you see from the back to the front .
which is , you know , you know , you know , in the front of what you recognize , beispielweise circle .
that means we &apos;re just looking at it , before we see it again , before we look at the back into our seheapparat , to say , okay .
i have some cognitive rückkoppelung , you have what projieziert what you want to see .
and that &apos;s also there , that &apos;s coming back .
and it goes back to the front , because this is not the back in the back of the front of course , you know , right now , and i &apos;m sure you , and you know , you know , you know , and you know , you know , if what you see , that &apos;s what you see .
and then it goes back to the back , and it &apos;s actually going to be .
so a very , very spannender process of how certain things happen , and in what these things happen to do .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s familiar with you this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve described .
now everyone &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who sees .
does anybody see something ?
a dalmatiner , right .
and once i saw that there &apos;s a dalmatiner in there , then you know that .
they will never forget it , because i &apos;ll show you where the dalmatiner is .
now you see the dalmatiner .
and on , you always see him .
that means , i actually verdorben it , that you don &apos;t actually see a pattern of dadrin , but i &apos;ve got it in a very short time to see this dog in a very short time .
and this is this projection of vision , rückkopplung .
now , i know , and now i &apos;m going to leave it now that i see the dalmatiner .
i see the dalmatiner .
so , very exciting processes that then , in the very exciting processes that then , you , you know , gray is not actually , but there &apos;s this rosanen mass in this rosanen mass .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
this is our present .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as a designer .
if i know , something about three seconds , until i sort of sort of the present into the vergangenheitsschleife , i can also bridge very well , very well to bridge in which i &apos;m going to get to someone with three seconds .
it &apos;s just to process than the present .
and then it goes to the past , and so i can bridge very elegant , for example , when i know this phenomenon .
what takes fünfundzwanzig milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
an interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s where you in love in love .
that means you know , if you know , if you know , if you know , look at how long you look at how long , because i &apos;m not going to take a gewähr of what it can happen to happen .
and sechzehn milliseconds , also an interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s where most of the perceptions we have .
this is , this first impression is happening in a fast fast speed how we perceive things .
and as we also see things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we also want to protect ourselves against our environment , we can think that way .
of course , designers don &apos;t deal with the subject of perceptions and neural verarbeitungen or kognitionsergonomie , , of course , with the subject of mensch-objekt-beziehung .
so , how is a person with certain things .
and there &apos;s some more practical functions , so there &apos;s some formale aspects or formalästhetische things .
there &apos;s anzeichen-funktionen where i know , where i actually have to reach .
but there are symbolic functions , why is somebody for such a little täschchen , where hardly anything like reinpasst , so horrende of money , even though it &apos;s not that practical ?
and we &apos;re more on the symbolischen , on the bedeutungsebene , on the bedeutungsebene , which we as a creator of course .
back to my real issue of natural user interface , and the theme of which , of course , is usability .
usability always means how can i be able to reach a certain target , or how can an users be effective in a certain sense of very effective , efficient and zufriedenstellend .
so it &apos;s more like the norm .
how can i do a little bit more ?
can i use that directly or do i need &apos; n manual , or i need a training training .
and less usable or benutzungsfreundlich is it .
that i &apos;m just doing this and do it , doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s better handhabbar .
you also have to understand .
and then if you know , in part of the software that we &apos;ve seen , you &apos;re going to understand why neunundneunzig percent of all of our software is very little intuitive or not to be useful , in many areas of areas or i-phone , although it &apos;s already much more intuitive than classical software .
there &apos;s intuitive benutzbarkeit , not only for apple , a fundamental wirtschaftsfaktor , nen elementary erfolgsfaktor , when i just want to make some technological devices .
why ?
because we &apos;re going through this new kind of nutzbarkeit , which is the natural user user , for example , for example , on the average of our goal .
you have to imagine that if you make something of the classical softrware , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software only one hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you can probably go home four hours , but your company , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , like it with four hours of hours .
but i want to say that , of course , of course , of course , is one of us , of course , to get some things .
and if we went back again in the realm of software , this is so the first command interfaces that were very abstract , where you took months to deal with these systems .
and then the next thing came to the next , that we &apos;ve got to do with &apos; , or mental model like the software , you know , you &apos;ve had an idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to harness the computer .
so no more zeros and ones or kryptische code , but a metaphor .
that &apos;s a lot of benutzungsfreundlicher , but it &apos;s also much better .
the next generation of graphischen benutzungsoberflächen works very much more with behavior .
so i &apos;m designing as a designer very much more often than that the behavior .
this is also a paradigm shift .
so , in once , that &apos;s going to look at the success for success , is an app .
and if i get a step further into this natural user interfaces , where i agree with the language , by language , by language , by the gesture , and no longer by a mouse , and no more than a mouse , it has to control , then i &apos;m left and left .
but that also , again , to the point , when are things going to be more intuitive ?
if you are more intuitive , and then i have to go back to my little friend here , and you know , what it means , right from the view of the kognitionsergonomie , when is really something that is really intuitive ?
and this is always for us to think about it , and that &apos;s what if i think about to think about it .
so he doesn &apos;t want to seem like to think , but they &apos;re just doing it .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does this mean for designers ?
that means that if we look at existing handlungsmodelle from one to something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can draw this as a creator .
that means i can just transfer an intuitive , human handlungsmodell on software , and make the software a lot of benutzungsfreundlicher .
and of course , the question is , of course , what &apos;s actually the intuitivste handlungsschema of people , and now i already tell you .
this is called the osit-modell .
that uses every one of us and osit is an acronym , and it &apos;s an acronym , selektieren , inform , inform .
that &apos;s the power of them all the time , but it &apos;s unbewusst it , and it &apos;s sort of intuitive , or in fact , instinctively .
so the model is going to be ausprägt in the womb and is interkulturell , and it works in young and old , and it &apos;s going to be used all the time , without the most of the time , that we know that this model .
osit osit is going to be about 50 to siebzigtausend times of us , so in your sleep , you &apos;ve realized that it &apos;s going to be less often strapaziert than the day .
now , i can tell you this mental handlungsmodell , selektieren , you know , you know , transagieren , übertragen übertragen .
and through these kinds of transmission , similar to the metaphor of desktops , now , no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a handlungsmusters , a handlungsprinzips .
and this is on a higher grail of benutzungsfreundlichkeit than the transmission of classical metaphor , which is the desktops .
and if i übertrage , for example , for example , , in the case of the case , you know , you know , in the case , in the case , you know , for example , i can look at it , and i can look at the point , i can look at it , and yeah , you know , i can also send it somewhere else or shop .
then i can transfer the whole .
i &apos;m trying to do this by a beispiels .
in fact , everybody ate .
übersicht : now i interact with the object with the object , can reinzoomen , reinzoomen .
i &apos;ll get the whole überblick of that , right now and can say that , just show me all the thing for example .
and at a point of once , what &apos;s much more intuitive and very much natural .
because that i can grab things like this , you know , and you can come to me , is much natural than when you think about hierarchisch organized websites or other mechanisms to sort of make these things available .
imagination is more important than knowledge knowledge , and with this sentence , i would like to close , and with this sentence , even designers have to think differently to get to new solutions , and in that sense , thank you very much close to your attention and please .
i want to give you to a very particular aspect of curiosity .
the first thing if you get a child as a child , as a child , as a baby , is that you &apos;re going to look at what you do , you know , you know , if your parents are going to be able to play more or less or less or less to play , the more or less in the töpfchen , the more , of course , your curiosity .
and the curiosity is not learning .
so all of that , these are and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m now , basically , this whole umweltdiskussion , weltuntergang , 40 years , club-of-rome , to do in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point .
and it depends on phosphorus .
give pee a chance .
every day , you give it scale about two gram of phosphorus , and every day you have to pick out two grams phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could just run as a amorphe mollusken through the weltmeere .
if we did no phosphorus and make phosphorus .
interestingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re in here with something that would be selbstverständlichkeit , but it &apos;s not that way .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody talks about the phosphor-problem .
the phosphor-problem is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only got phosphorus for two years , and now through the phosphor-bergbau in the world , a lot more uranium has been used to be used in all the atomanlagen .
in the last 20 years alone , fünfzehntausend tons of uranium have been distributed in our fields in germany .
and we take it all .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , schütz the environment , get less car .
schütz the environment , make less waste .
schütz the environment , verbrauche less energy .
but that &apos;s no protection .
this is what if i would say , if i would say , it &apos;s just three times less times less than five times .
this is just a little less destruction .
if we think about this from the wiege to the bahre , our whole world is used to be , or later .
that &apos;s about thinking about wiege .
and the most important thing about this is to look at the ground .
in the ground , over sechzig percent of the kohlenstoffs .
at the moment we &apos;re building corn and lose from 11 and 30 pounds of 30 tons per acres , or on square feet too .
that means we &apos;re losing five times more than new gebildet .
and of course , of course , we can look at the müllproblem .
and everything is verpackung or content .
for example , in offenbach , for example , at the hausmüll 20 percent of the müllmenge .
and because we get older , the windeln will be bigger .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re all in the vorwindelphase .
yes ?
a baby needs about six thousand windeln .
we could reduce that for 10 percent , but what does that do ?
that &apos;s ausgeglichen in china in a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go to these windeln ?
this is the evidence by the way that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus will be emitted in the pigs over the solid components .
people over the urine .
yes .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s belegt , right ?
traditionally , we think in the umweltdiskussion , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you ask people that if you know , if you say , if you say , it would be better , you &apos;re not there , you &apos;re going to be raffgierig and hostile .
and so someone says al gore , one of our great heroes , there is nothing more wichtigeres than the human population .
in israel , you say , if you put a human life , you rettest the earth .
here it says , the more you umbringst , the better .
yes .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on the earth , then the ants weigh about four times more than us .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , no one like that , even though , even though , even though they &apos;re a vegetarier .
that means the ants weigh a lot more than us .
and because they work much harder than we were , and because they &apos;re only three to six months , they are in their weight , in energy consumption , something about 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too much , we &apos;re stupid , right ?
and what you &apos;re going to do , how far we want to get away , and how far we could do it , and how far do we want to do what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are at all at all of the earth is , you can see , for example , for example , is a program , until you want to be klimaneutral , right now , right ?
you can only be klimaneutral if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you seen a klimaneutralen tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means , our whole intelligence means that we want to be dümmer as a trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is kohlenstoffneutral .
for happiness , yes ?
there &apos;s no überbevölkerungsproblem of trees .
there are still six billion trees alone in amazonasgebiet .
you &apos;ve heard some of the überbevölkerungsproblemen of trees ?
this is , all our intelligence means that we want to be dümmer as a trees .
and where you see , even at something like demeter , the strikteste bio- , agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow our own stoffwechselprodukte .
every year we lose so three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back into them .
and we are too many .
on it alone .
that is what we feel guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no bio-landbau , no bioland , no nature-et-progrès , no nature-et-progrès , and they &apos;re all the way that our own exkremente will go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we are too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , to be less harmful .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about to have a great footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , is the highest , not being there , right ?
nullemissionen , yeah ?
you can only nullemissionen if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot yourself , you would have emissions .
so they can &apos;t solve it .
we can do it differently .
we can take our nutrients back .
we do in brazil agriculture in which we get the nutrients .
in fact , we can zurückkriegen nutrients in this way in agriculture .
we do this in china , for example , for example , where we go directly .
in china , one is called honigtöpfchen , right now , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , our nutrients .
that means the whole western western zivilisationsgeschichte suggests that the city has always taken , but the farmers never returned .
and so the cities had to grow the cities , because the farmers went to the cities and the cities always had to move their nutrients .
so all of that all the western rich are always expanding , until they have no longer done , and then they &apos;re implodiert .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done bruchlos civilization over five thousand years because you &apos;ve been able to zurückzubringen nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat in china , you expect to eat that you &apos;re going to go to the toilet until .
because it &apos;s unfreundlich , to go and take nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to eat , not to nährstoffdiebstahl .
that means you can see , in the internet , you can see the nutrients .
well , in fact , if you do that , if you do that , so it creates agriculture , in a acres of country , in favelas , you can do a farmer about eintausendfünfhundert dollars , and the plant will wait for chickens and warten and fische and vegetables and fish .
and the great thing about this is that the verbrechensrate in the favelas is back over neunzig percent .
so we don &apos;t need to be able to be very little bad .
we can support them to be good .
that &apos;s of course high-tech-landwirtschaft , of course , but the facilities carry themselves .
the nebenprodukt is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by the design that they can just manage .
that means that the verbrechensraten go back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve now built over hundertfünzig in the last 20 years , none of these facilities ever became sabotiert .
they could just einfach a liter of altöl , and then it would be ruined over years .
doesn &apos;t happen .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people to be very little bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to zurückkriegen phosphorus phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you &apos;re going to write , in germany , in germany , in germany , in germany , it &apos;s in .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not in offenbach , but maybe you can help the frankfurtern , you know .
because the frankfurter plant could get the phosphorus back .
and it has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s true .
we &apos;ve been used in holland for three years .
the dutch government explains , they will be the first country in the world , which is zurückgewinnt phosphorus .
but we need this overall .
you can understand , there are two countries controlling almost 70 percent of the phosphorvorkommen around the world .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of waisenknaben .
these are sechsundzwanzig countries , control 40 percent of ölvorräte .
and we &apos;re going to replace the oil by other energieträger .
but the phosphorus will not replace .
it &apos;s not about making the existing a little less bad , but it &apos;s about doing something right .
and in front of all , first of all , to wonder what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , of course , you understand that easier , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if you have their wife sad , if you &apos;ve got them , if they geärgert them , and they &apos;re coming with 50 .
very inefficient .
but it &apos;s really effective , right ?
or take a lippenstift .
a woman in germany is about six kilograms of three kilograms of their life .
that .
it &apos;s not exactly right , because we don &apos;t know how much weggeküsst is going to do .
but a lippenstift , even at this lighting , can i tell you , is completely inefficient , but very effective , right ?
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not a resource resource , but efficiency .
questions , what is the right thing ?
not to burn a little bit better and abzulagern it , and abzulagern all the way to lose all the materials for those together , but first time , how do you make those together ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
when i go to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill a pill with offenbach-geschmack and a glass of water .
wonderful , right ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything that matters in life is not to save , to reduce .
the whole umweltdiskussion .
we say the people , oh , you don &apos;t have a green green in the south .
no , it &apos;s just the right thing , right ?
in every place where you wegwirft , yes , yes , you do it again .
but the wrong thing .
if you get the wrong things , you have a müllproblem .
as we think of north .
there is every footprint .
if they run , yes , every footprint destroyed the ground .
because the ground is going to die and the wind and the water is wäscht the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water remains in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a great footprint that becomes a feuchtgebiet .
not schuldmanagement .
we say in germany sustainability .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how do you do this with your wife ?
what do they say ?
sustainable .
then i say , herzliches beileid , yeah ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so not saving , avoid verzichten .
every waste is nährstoff .
and it &apos;s one lust , if you see in italy , like the people in the high bow , it &apos;s coladose from the car .
because you know , this is a lustvoller process .
it &apos;s called the form of revierverhalten , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a eiscremeverpackung , which is in temperature room .
they can wegschmeißen where they go and stand .
in two hours , they go everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they make out of biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so they are going to be two together .
it &apos;s not all to be kompostierbar .
a tv machine or a washing machine , they &apos;re just using it , they don &apos;t use .
just the things that verschleißen , like schuhsolen , like bremsbeläge , like autoreifen , like autoreifen , they have to be in biological systems .
the things that are only used , go in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the sneaker , right ?
so , direct advertising , not for the company , and it &apos;s not for the company , but you can now help this company to make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t make things out of the things .
yes ?
so , when i go to the food and say , this is free from hähnchen , it doesn &apos;t help you .
no , we lay on what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like detox .
not toxic in there .
it &apos;s all that &apos;s in it is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can go to the kavalierstart on the fußgängerampel , and you can go gummi in biological trials , right ?
all of that is kompostierbar .
and if we can do , of course , , of course , it &apos;s for nike , for nike , for nike , for nike and mauritz and the textilindustrie .
and this is half of all the abwasserprobleme around the world that will be caused by the textile industry .
so you can help with , you ask questions about people .
hey , puma , power are you really serious ?
because they have now changed the vorstandsvorsitzenden .
and i &apos;m not so sure if you really dabeibleiben .
so , help me take a little bit of this .
but it goes .
yes .
what &apos;s been shown right now .
that &apos;s going .
now , we can do things now , if you &apos;re verschleißen , if you &apos;re kaputtgehen , you can put them in biological whales .
the technical whales are .
there &apos;s a direct rücknamesystem .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , to go back to go back into the cycle .
it also , so in any store , you can zurückkriegen things .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the windel ?
when at the moment , the waste is .
all of these windeln are around , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s on the deponien , but also in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastics , so it can go in biological systems , if we can change the wasserspeicher , the inside that you can go back to zellulosebasis , you can go back with a baby in israel , or in tunisia trees .
yes ?
only if you take these windel , you , you know , sterilisieren and the powder and the powder to plant trees .
this is the baby kohlenstoffpositiv for the whole life , from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be klimaneutral , we can be klimapositiv .
it &apos;s kind of a beneficial poop .
yeah , sort of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything again .
i started a institute .
now , a lot of people are working there , and they can all get involved .
there &apos;s extra a group of a group of cradle-to-cradle-verein , where everyone can go .
so not save anymore , using rid , avoid , reduce , reduce , not schuldmanagement , but smart waste .
do you do that curious ?
thank you .
the work of interpreten .
music as a language .
in the description of my talk , i said that i was as a interpretin , as a übersetzerin myself as a übersetzerin .
interpreten are the written notes of the written notes in klingende music .
that , as a language , not just a word for the text into a different language , but also the deeper sense of the words and the deeper sense of the words and wortzusammenhang , so that it makes a good translation , anybody knows it to do with fremdsprachen .
to translate from the germans to the english , you can have more knowledge , if you know , if it &apos;s about poetry or at poetry .
but it &apos;s really alien , but it &apos;s für , what we &apos;re going to do with our musiksprache .
so as a musikstückes of a musikstückes , i just first of all the written notes .
you think that the composer has all the notes in the notes , which he has thought .
in fact , the notes are very vague and ungenau .
these notes are sort of the same or ungenau , like a mind , as well , as a very seemingly penibelst of a landscape .
because in this verbalen landschaftsbeschreibung , the smell of flowers is not to smell , the degree of the grüns , just to hear the säuseln of the windes , not to feel .
that means , the interpret has got to take this ungenauen data on another , which is hörbare , concrete , nonverbale musiksprache .
today , i want to give you what i would say , you know , you know , again , again , into a verbal language .
so basically a translation of translation .
that &apos;s why i prefer to do the whole thing in german , because if i had to translate it back to english , it would be known for me in the translation of the translation of the translation .
so the music works for me as much like a spoken language .
the notierten notes have the function of a writing .
so it doesn &apos;t take the only notes to learn how to read , and they turn to the piano on the piano or the right place on the piano .
that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
and the sense of the letters you can see when you can do it .
so , for the learning process of the music process , for least as long as the spoken language .
so there &apos;s also abstufungen , whether you learn it for the hausgebrauch , you know , you can understand passive , or you can be active , to the musical speaker .
the work of the interpreten starts like a theaterregisseurs .
and after you first chose to play a piece , because you &apos;re excited about , you know , you know , forscht from the composition of the composition of the composition of the composition .
you collect information about the piece in sekundärliteratur .
you read in the letters , tagebüchern , notes , or whether words , thoughts , thoughts of myself .
you study the works that he had written and after .
you make comparison .
the beweggründe , writing it .
and what did he feel like ?
what were its lebensumstände , like the society and politics ?
all i &apos;m interested in .
you &apos;re thinking in this time in this time , by reading contemporary images or reading literature .
but over time , you &apos;ve also got a rich knowledge of the composers , you know , you know , and it gets easier to be easier to feel and feel .
the composer is going to be more for the friend that you live with .
his cause to write that piece is going to be more and more and more and more personal issues personal issues to play .
now , there &apos;s all the notes that everything else &apos;s record of the message of the composer , but just a framework , i &apos;m now going to turn this framework to make sense with sense and meaning .
and then i say to my own words , which might be written between this framework .
i play on what these sounds might have .
now , for me , and for the composer and what they might mean for him now .
every note , every phrase gets a sense , because i think it &apos;s myself , because it comes from my own gelebten .
it has to be for me in here , and now i can &apos;t convince my audience that this is my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert when i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve made as long as a long way in advance .
you know , as a happy day , even though , even though with the same rituals rituals of life , stand up , breakfast , breakfast , to work , i &apos;d like the same piece of the same piece over again .
i &apos;ve gotten older a day older , the seasons , my pulse goes down at the night , in the morning , in a konzertsaal , it takes longer that the sound coming back to the sound .
i &apos;m going to take the audience right , consciously .
all of this affects me , and all of that affects my experience with the composition .
it &apos;s also very wonderful when i &apos;m standing on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , angeregten conversation .
you get a new idea in this , and i &apos;ll end up with this answer with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting because then things that we don &apos;t have , and what you can &apos;t do so well .
it &apos;s a great fun to do this kind of music , and you know , as the audience , then , as the music communicates .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play anymore , like this .
i can &apos;t play today as well as in 20 years .
and i &apos;m going to have more lebenserfahrung than today , and i &apos;m going to have a lot more farbnuancen on my palette of musikklänge , in the emotion and emotions and emotion than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have a few farbtöpfe , but it &apos;s new dazubekommen .
have a nice concrete example .
it was on a klavierkursus for musikstudenten in my beloved teacher , professor jürgen ude , a known beethoven-spezialist , konzertpianist , and long-term professor of musikhochschule here in stuttgart .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so that he was emeritiert when i finally started studying .
but i was lucky enough to meet him very early , with 13 years , to meet , and i was at my high school .
i was 17 when i went back to one of his classes at one of his classes , and i played the last four balladen of chopin , a spätwerk .
he asked me what was the introduction of this ballade for me .
this is a getragenes part .
and in my jugendlichkeit , i said , expectation .
and he said , and he said , so ?
this has to be the altersunterschied .
because for me , she means memory .
he was already sechzig .
well , with 17 , you have dreams , but not significant memories .
i play the piece of games today , and always it turned out for me , even though , even though not a single grade has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because again , i read something new .
an example of this is a very different area , the seerosen x-mal .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different tageszeit , with verschiedenem light .
he was translated the seerosen verschiedentlich , as he saw her , as she looked at him right now .
his personal impressionen of seerosen .
the x-malige interpretation of a piece is comparable .
now , i &apos;m also older than chopin with zweiunddreißig years when he wrote this piece .
he only lived neununddreißig years .
and it &apos;s important for me to look back into the notes , even if i mean .
to keep zwiesprache , right with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially when he died .
now , how do you start talking to the language of music ?
i said yes , you need about the same as long as a spoken language .
often , the musikunterricht is so that you learn the notes .
you &apos;re learning basically to read that before you just talk a word .
you learn the notes to find the notes in the instrument .
if all of the fingers in time , and it &apos;s right in time , as it turns out of the notes , they come out of sound that sounds like music .
if that &apos;s happening , the student gets the nächstschwierige piece .
you &apos;re barely talking about interpretation .
well , there &apos;s a presto , that &apos;s a fast piece .
lento , slowly .
loud and leisezeichen , f and b , etc .
you know most here .
but even if you umsetzt this data , it &apos;s still just a technical thing .
and it &apos;s still no interpretation interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something very elementares .
namely , to make music on the instrument , to make your musical work and feel before .
that is that singing .
a kid that didn &apos;t have learned that , because the parents don &apos;t have vorgemacht , it won &apos;t be done by itself .
this is like sprechenlernen .
it &apos;s necessary to have his own experiences and idea of music to be then another way , about one more way , to make it sound .
people who have never singing , therefore , have never felt directly with your body , as it is to form a sound .
a phrase to make his own breath .
the music instrument is an extension of our body .
and our stimmbänder to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the hammerköpfe in the piano are the sequel of my finger .
the tune comes from the gesungenen and the rhythm from the dance .
the dauernde berieselung today with music today is not förderlich .
you don &apos;t need to make music even if it becomes boring .
no longer needed to whistle or singing .
every music is going to be plattgemacht when you move from the outside with music .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
i can &apos;t sing , you can &apos;t sing , a , because you believe you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to figure out if they can &apos;t do it , or learn how to be able to put these little muscles who are used to be .
because you can train .
or c , because you &apos;ve bescheinigt them , they &apos;re untauglich .
so , i think , how fachlich was this diagnosis ?
did you get a zweit- or drittmeinung , how you say it right now ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and therefore you don &apos;t have to do it either .
but then what i was doing , though , because music is a beautiful , kommunikative thing .
but maybe you can also umstimmen them .
well , so you see , all of these cases , nobody has to be a aussichtsloser candidate .
but don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand anything about classical music .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
i say , you know , but sure you can tell you whether it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says somebody , i don &apos;t know if it tastes me because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t get rid of food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to stop classical music on classical music because you don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to them and say whether it tastes it or not .
whether the music is too gepfeffert or too sweet .
tell you what you feel .
over time , you also get standards , and you want a little bit more gewürze , or taste even fine differences .
why do i challenge from my audience now that it &apos;s also being active ?
because the music is a language , and a language is there to communicate .
a piece of artwork you never look at has no power to work .
the food that &apos;s from a chef or a chef liebevoll has got to be eaten , and not just looked at play-doh recipes .
so please listen to when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice geräuschtapete .
if in a environment , when the adult adults , or at least hear music , a child grows up , it &apos;s very easy for a musiklehrer , to ask , what color has your flower ?
can you play them in blue now ?
and the kid is playing , after a gedenkpause , instead of a red flower , now a blue flower .
and this sounds very different than before .
that was the very first beginning of a musical expression .
so the first step to a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today , that &apos;s originally a hundred , zweihundert , or three years ago ?
now , the instruments have fortentwickelt .
there was actually no piano at the time .
it was just not invented .
i think that the stream would have been excited if he had the klanglichen possibilities of modern klaviere .
i can see the klangvorstellungen that the stream had had , in the modern wing , which can &apos;t get a barockes cembalo .
and by beethoven beethoven , you know that he heard more deaf than he was already deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which is a orchestra from then as a unspielbar .
that &apos;s why composers are angewiesen on us to reinvent the pieces again .
so they &apos;re going to be up , what they &apos;ve seen in the mind .
and also what they &apos;re thinking about in the mind .
or what i &apos;m doing today is because what you might have thought .
thank you .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
were you neidisch ?
and how did this feel ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
and then when i get , with my little v , the piesel and i &apos;m going to do that feeling with my little bit of this feeling .
i got something through the head .
i say , ulf , what do you need to do ?
that &apos;s the first year half of his value .
and at all , you work much less than me .
why do i afford to afford &apos; n little car ?
and then immediately , it falls to me , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say the word of justice , this awkward feeling is gone .
and our organism has invented a great method to make sense of feelings like envy simply .
you can also try this with words like revenge or gewinnsucht or something .
i want to talk to you this mechanism today , or something that you &apos;re not likely to be familiar with .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you may have heard , when people say , nobody has to build a wall .
and then auftürmt auftürmt , so he versperrt them .
like a lie like this a lie , you don &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s überdies easy to check that he &apos;s very different in mind .
he &apos;s just täuscht them and not himself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about that is to do with that they &apos;re täuschen themselves .
you need this lie to get a lebenslüge , to get an selbsttäuschung upright .
they can get less easy , yes , nachprüfen , or down .
you need time .
from this time , an anecdote is an anecdote that you might know .
the spanish painter pablo picasso once has a woman .
this woman has beschwert , and the portrait wouldn &apos;t see her .
picasso says , just wait .
it &apos;s always more similar .
in this point , and if you laugh , you see how important this lie is , and how much time you need to know what artists are very good at us .
because artists have a gestörtes relationship to a lie .
and the artist share with you something with , and especially this lady , what you don &apos;t see if you just look in the mirror .
the artist is sharing to you in a portrait with what you &apos;re going to do when you look at that work over again .
then this awkward feeling , it may not be similar to you , and it &apos;s always more similar to you .
so here you have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to the stabilisierung of our lebensverhältnisse .
and not only in the arts , also in the volksmärchen , in the mythology , in stories , in stories .
you may know this idea of the lady that looked at every morning in the mirror and asked him , who is the most beautiful in the entire country ?
one day , this mirror says yes , there &apos;s a schönere .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility out of this true , the mirror can &apos;t lie , from that true auskunft .
but we should just be familiar with ourselves that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a schönere somewhere else .
here &apos;s what we need to understand under politically correctness , over again .
we need this lie to this lie that aufrechterhält us , without even that we can &apos;t survive .
we don &apos;t only have in art , in the volksmärchendichtung , but also in science like this .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman of the bischofs of worchester .
she heard from this book from charles darwin , the origin of the species and the line of people .
that the human being should be abstammen , and , yeah , at least , there would be a common ancestors between people and monkeys .
and she ran her to her husband and said , well that &apos;s not true what charles writes .
human beings should have to be abstammen or a common ancestors .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to prevent people will know about it .
why do we prevent people know that people know about something when it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live without these lebenslüge .
because we have this selbsttäuschung , this sense of being great , from the highest creature , not from one such naturebene , such a little bit like a organism that &apos;s still there , it &apos;s kind of the things that is for us .
so , we can &apos;t bear these things .
we need to prevent that people have known by things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you see how slowly this mechanism is out of this mechanism , and like the traces , he &apos;s leaving that &apos;s going to run on something else in this great image of ourselves , i want to see you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , like me .
my wife told me .
she came one day from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told about a student .
a autistischer student .
she &apos;d like it particularly , because he &apos;s got a neigung .
and she asked him , what are your peers ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire fire .
and because i am in the fire , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnische things .
yeah , you know , if you &apos;re heiter at this point , there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , whenever a person in a moral place in a moral place , because it &apos;s used , we should try to replace it , even though .
do that once , and then you learn the sentence .
even though i am at the fire , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnische things .
and you feel that &apos;s the real truth .
so a little bub , which is not interested in feuerlöschen .
it &apos;s interested in feuermachen .
but there are no clubs that we can look around , where you learn how to do fire .
there &apos;s only the second best , just the fire .
there he signed up .
and überdies , you also don &apos;t tell the teacher that you &apos;d like to put fires somewhere , and you &apos;re happy when your fire after .
no , it just looks a lot better when we show that we &apos;re in charge of the risks that can only do it , you know , if you have a fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
and these verweis , in the innersten of the bub , he knew that he actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say it loud .
here you have this zensor between the unconscious and the conscious person who &apos;s immediately anspringt , and the things that you know , and the things you know , you look very different , so designed that they can make much better for them and others .
and then they &apos;re just going to create words that we &apos;re going to use in the language of the politically right again .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know if we tell this , the social story are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do these things in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
now , i want to tell you what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
and what logic this deception is that selbsttäuschung , the willingness , the willingness to be a different reality than the ones that we already know at the unconscious , that it &apos;s considered to spread out .
that &apos;s what i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is setzt , what many of you know , and some of you don &apos;t appreciate very few of them at all .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is such an intellectual , he says about leibniz .
she &apos;s something that &apos;s not stofflicher , physical nature .
and if you &apos;ve got people who have been erweckt , you know that they have a soul , or you know , you know , that they have been like , they have a soul , they have been like , they have a soul , not matter of matter , you know , even from meat and blood , a little bit of meat , in the earth , etwas , etwas , vergängliches , verwesbares , unwichtiges , dead .
and from this soul , they think that they sort of sort of wolkigen nature , in these luftigen nature , is called anima it in the latin , the lufthauch , your mind .
and if this lufthauch came over to the people , then he &apos;s filled with dignity , with the spirit , with nature that &apos;s only life , yes with a soul .
and then he can davonlaufen .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we &apos;re supposed to be able to be able to present it as something , which is supposed to be present for our lives .
and if you have that premise of eyes , you can understand the logic that &apos;s the logic of the logic to be able to improve the world through a lie .
because now you can apply a dreisatz .
you know , you know from school .
now this is a dreisatz that describes an logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk by the way .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
that is to lie that you can just apply this logic wrong .
in this dreisatz , three sentences come in .
the first sentence is klaus , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , when klaus are right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i found him especially here .
a third sentence , which comes up with people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say who &apos;s not a soul , who is dead , and cannot say anything .
and here &apos;s what you feel .
here &apos;s this logic in this , yes , in this täuschenden talk .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they are logical right .
because i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t speak about reality .
i can say , the kanzlerin is a man .
and when i &apos;m right , the kanzlerin is a man .
if i don &apos;t right , it &apos;s not a man .
the logic is no matter about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but key , when i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so when klaus says , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical right .
and now our most of our consciousness feels immediately , you can do something .
it depends on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and it &apos;s like the opposite of the first sentence already proved .
because actually we would have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic , it simply uses that two sentences that two sentences , and a third dazuhängt , which looks like he would have something to do with this , we can save our lebenslüge .
so , we &apos;re like it &apos;s actually impossible without being able to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things on different examples .
in the present , we &apos;ve got a whole modern example of modern example .
that &apos;s what you have to do is make another philosophisches subject , a dauerbrenner from philosophy .
and this has to do that we go back into the vierzehnte century .
there was a gelehrten , which was johannes buridanus , and after this , der esel .
the buridansche esel is a esel that is made out of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
this is a naturding .
and if you put that exactly in the middle between two gleichgroßen heuhafen , he verhungert .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a haystack he should go first .
so he &apos;s just in the middle .
this is the naturdinge .
gleichgroße forces with gegensätzlichem vorzeigenzeichen solve each other .
there &apos;s nothing at all .
only if you get another example , so if you immediately take a haystack bigger , it doesn &apos;t need reason and nothing about it .
automatically , he goes to the right thought .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of being driven in nature , you know , from the larger pile , from the bigger pile , you also have the feeling that there must be something like free will .
and if we &apos;re also here in frankfurt , i remember the max-planck-institut in brain science .
there &apos;s a gelehrten , which is called a wolf , and from him sometimes says sometimes , sometimes , you know , wolf singer singer , there &apos;s no willensfreiheit .
now we can form the second sentence , and we can say , if wolf &apos;s right , he &apos;s got no willensfreiheit .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can now read in the daily newspaper , you know , in this third sentence .
it looks like this , who doesn &apos;t have a willensfreiheit , can also not for his action and claims to responsibility , and it &apos;s so unzurechnungsfähig .
you have it again .
in fact , you &apos;d have to see if there is something like willensfreiheit .
but the logic of deception allows us to do it as if the first sentence of the first sentence is wrong , you know , of course , you know , the opposite of course you would take the opposite without proof .
and now you can just do that if you want to test anything , if you want to test anything , and most of all , if you want to make people happy to lie on a lie .
practice , for example , if you meet a person that you can say , there &apos;s no vorhersager .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for vorhersager , which is called the prophet .
you can &apos;t call it , that would be a little politisch .
say , there &apos;s no vorhersager .
immediately , you will be one , of course , you know , of course , you know , you know , you know , you can &apos;t prove .
and you have a problem .
because while they &apos;re engaged with that they can &apos;t prove that they can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no vorhersager , the man &apos;s very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he getäuscht .
because he has led them to a fährte , which he doesn &apos;t use themselves .
because actually , this man is not interested in evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in it , even in front of the need to prove that there are vorhersager .
so , in the kind of climate change , you see the großartigkeit of the lie .
and once again , if you have a way to feel that dreisatz with other people , they do it , because they &apos;re going to make other happy if they don &apos;t remember them in that way .
thank you for your attention .
yes , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve allowed myself to lilly if i can mention you .
she &apos;s one of the veranstalterinnen here from this great event , and asked me if i wanted to hold a talk and give my idea .
i have to say , you know , you know , i was very difficult to talk about my idea .
and i may be able to introduce my inselprojekt that i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum , quite many ideas .
i &apos;m likely to be the two little girls , i &apos;ve been part of the generation , i &apos;m part of the generation , because i &apos;ve been neunzehnhundertneunundsiebzig , because i &apos;ve started to study patients in karlsruhe , technical school , i mean , you know , i think .
and i got it in the achtziger years to berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and that was not in karlsruhe .
there was the kernforschungsanlage leopoldshafen .
they were all kfa , also die was called kfa .
that &apos;s projektträger today .
because a good engineer has built a great car or atomkraftanlagen .
but this sort of doofes like &apos; n solarpendel , which is sort of a hundred watts of the square square , which was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy ingenieurkollektiv .
i &apos;m grateful to be grateful that he has rehabilitiert the word again , because after the mauerfall , you couldn &apos;t use the word anymore , because the left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t like this in the achtiziger years .
and it was that there was selbstverwaltete alternativbetriebe , and one of them was sitting in kreuzberg , in kreuzberg where you thought to evil .
and the place of the terrorismusses , but that was wuseltronik and made wind and solar power , and i started the achtziger .
and yes , a lot of what i said today was very , very , many , a lot of beautiful expressions that i have lived through .
i worked for 11 years in the collective , which was basisdemokratisch .
we were twenty people .
and if no said no , it was a completely zermürbt , and i &apos;ve got to be able to do that for 10 years , if i really got my great ingenieurstudium , because all of my father , because all of my father my father &apos;s colleagues , you &apos;ve always been zugeredet , you &apos;ve always rausgeschmissen the window to the window .
it &apos;s busy .
and that was really very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very bitter .
and i got it up until sechsundneunzig ausgehalten , and then we went together with friends with friends , which then became solon with the spin-off q-cells of the world &apos;s largest zellenhersteller .
so , again , we &apos;ve got a little bit of the zukunft , and we have a little group of the future , and we &apos;ve got a little bit of the future , and we &apos;ve got a little bit of the future , and i think it , again , it &apos;s crazy , again , that the people say what &apos;s supposed to do , it &apos;s not all , we &apos;re talking about store .
and then i brought a project i brought to you now want to imagine .
and the title of talk was , just like to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just have just begun with a relatively einfach-verrückten story , where could you have a memory of memory today .
on this island , this is the island of graciosa on the azoren .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
a half a half thousand people .
they have a renewables today from 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
it &apos;s just technological .
if you zubauen more to each other , the system starts to fail .
i &apos;m also telling politicians when they &apos;re in berlin-adlershof our facility .
they always say , why ?
we &apos;ve already done 20 percent in germany .
but it can &apos;t be a problem .
but it &apos;s not true , we have seven percent , and our net is physically the european .
if we had 20 percent , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , the math -- that was zweitausend2006 , the first contact with the island of the island , it just through .
so as big as big as big as a battery , you have to be a battery , so you have an island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe maybe 70 percent renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go back again .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , a hundred gigawatt electrical performance are about a hundred gigawatt on the world .
that &apos;s the power of a hundred nuclear power , because this is all everywhere .
the energiehunger of the world , it &apos;s going to be gelöscht by diesel , because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s how fast .
you put this box .
and then it looks like this .
in that &apos;s always three of the dieseln , two .
yeah , this is what you see there is a burden down there .
we also have very detailed data .
and the windkraftanlage or the solaranlage or whatever it is , it &apos;s usually a back-up system , is a system , which can be a system in small quantities here .
our goal was to say it .
the diesel is back-up and the wind , sun bedienen the burden of the burden that they can map the larger .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewables , you want energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn off the diesel .
that is , in the moment you have to worry about that renewables can kind of take the whole net .
so , of course , you , of course , of course , if you &apos;re in some way in some way .
this has no one in the world yet .
this is in the small style , so you can also use your rasierer on a little wechselrichter .
people always ask me , what are you going to be in adlershof ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
but if you want to take several of these wechselrichtern zusammenschalten , and you want to build a net , that &apos;s very complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to siebzig percent renewable percent renewable , and then there &apos;s the rest of this rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which is going to be very , very expensive , and that &apos;s not going to work that you &apos;re going to do that from batteries .
this is going to be a solar system , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , or sch , that will be .
they have to go to a saisonalspeicher and winter-sommer and not just tag-nacht .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s because with a normal , stinknormalen battery .
so how far do you get there ?
and then have done a whole lot of simulations .
and have wind and the last and the load and the burden , and they came to the result , a very interesting result , that after 20 years of the conventional system , that after 20 years , the middle of about 50 cents a kilowattstunde , it takes to be about vierundvierzig .
these were the very first calculations about six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper as the diesel-system when the dieselpreis goes up five percent per year .
and then we started to negotiate with the insulanern .
what would have to be done ?
did investors with investors , i looked for new gesellschafter .
we were only five people at the time to build the society again .
and here &apos;s the representation .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green one is our system .
that our system also has a preisanstieg , because it &apos;s because we still do 20 percent with diesel , and also a preissteigerung on the other things .
and the power-utility that elektrizitätsversorgungsunternehmen the elektrizitätsversorgungsunternehmen on the island , has meant that we &apos;re all great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you that you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , in which we could sort of building the electric history of the island of the island to three .
that means we &apos;ve been looking for first to find the largest battery in the world .
here it is .
this comes naturally from asia , in the case of japan .
and witzigerweise , she was in the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , has been developed , and then became auslizensiert auslizensiert .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has a megawatts performance , and it can take six hours for six hours , and this is the battery that we &apos;re sort of simulationstechnisch rausbekommen .
and then made it .
so we also have one of these diesel-aggregate in the same size of this , in fact , in the same size of this web , in fact , it &apos;s going to be the whole dynamic , in the back of this , in the back in the back in the back , in the back , in the back of the time , there is the big battery , there &apos;s the whole umrichter that we &apos;re going to simulate the web .
over here we &apos;re going to simulate the whole übertragungsleitungsystem , the kilometer-physik of the cable , to sort of represent the schwingungsverhalten on the web .
and you can see here again .
we can also aufschalten zweihundert kilowatt on the web .
so here we see this again , again again , again , again , this whole , individual aggregate .
and what we did have been done since zweitausendneun has been done , as well , all the time , all the time , all over the single system between the individual system of electronics to develop software , we did .
so we &apos;re not a batteriehersteller , but we define as a company that &apos;s only between the subject of a battery and the subject , and everything in between .
you have to communicate to the battery , of course , you can also communicate to the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the nice thing about the topic that you &apos;re basically in this island of all , you know everything that &apos;s going to be the vorwegnehmen of problems that we &apos;re going to get when we want to raise our proportion of renewables .
so this whole discussion , how is going to go back at the moment and herbewegt , how to go , for example , on the island for fünfundzwanzig , for example , for fünfundzwanzig to 30 percent , so we müdsen the wind and the sun .
natürlicht is bietet .
so smart-grid , a riesenthema everywhere .
we can even start to integrate in the island , to integrate elektromobilität , because you can manage the burden .
that means , if you &apos;re 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can smart-grid through &apos; n , you can get the nets for bed nets , yes , you know , you can do it , the percentage of erhören , but you will never get rid of memory .
and that &apos;s so &apos; n a message .
so a lot of people are going to look at that , just because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn it off the diesel , you know , you have no longer mass that causes a certain trägheit in the web .
and our europäisches verbundnetz is basically taken from a louder rotierenden mass of large kraftwerken , where the wave is all around europe around europe .
we &apos;re looking in this web , you see 50 , and if it &apos;s going to be neunundvierzig at a point nine , we start a few ventilchen aufzumachen , and then again , again , a little bit of a little merh , then we get up again .
this is the system .
and of course , this is incredible .
if you runterreißen it somewhere , it &apos;s a while .
the spinning reserves has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time , they can respond again .
if you don &apos;t have any more , you have to replace this spinning mass , then you have to replace this with leistungselektronik and elektrochemie .
and we can rein-rausschalten with this big battery , two milliseconds .
and then you see , which is the enormous geschwindigkeitsmöglichkeiten .
and the message now is , we have to get massen , 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 , 30 percent and so on , when we want to reach all the way that we want to do that .
then we have to break our must-run capacity on the net .
must-run is simple , the power station to keep the frequency .
yeah , this is a riesendebatte at the moment , zubau from the kohlekraftwerken , because we don &apos;t , or gasturbinen , because we don &apos;t .
and we &apos;re just trying to tell you that you can get the capacity , the must-run capacity , can break down , by getting elektrochemische memory into the net .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a lot of studies now .
and to that point , people are always coming up and look at our versuchsstand , sort of our inselteststand .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far you can get a piece of the future .
and many discussions that i had been in the last six years , in the last six years , was similar to the discussion that i had over the last 30 years .
don &apos;t go , it &apos;s been schwachsinn , kinderspielkram , you know , you know , don &apos;t matter .
we have dreißig gigawatt photovoltaik in germany today .
this is vorbildlich .
and i &apos;m just walking out that , in the next 30 years , in the next 30 years , we will have the same capacity to store the same capacity on the world .
it &apos;s very simple .
this is going to be a whole bunch of widerständen and arguments .
the beautiful thing is that i &apos;ve been in the last two years in the last two years that scientists have seen on my side .
we &apos;ve got to have 10 million förderprojekte , also to klemmen a german zehn-megawatt-batterie right now .
that &apos;s going to happen in the next april .
so you know , you realize that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s just to be out of this abwehrhaltung , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable renewable .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a autarkes system .
so far , in discussions , they &apos;re always trying to get these insulaner , these insulaner , they have a little bit of their own little web , which has nothing to do with our verbund .
and the question is quite simply , if you &apos;re totally independent from any fossil or uranen energierträgern , which will be rausgebohrt somewhere in the world , and you &apos;re going to be hingebracht , you &apos;re an island .
then they only use what &apos;s going on sun and wind there is where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a vernüftigen energy supply , and i &apos;m also grateful that they said solar power .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do , the talk about premium kola , that you can be a collective and use solar power , there &apos;s a little together .
and yes , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be quiet a little bit crazy , and you can have a vision .
and you really have to stay in it , but i think it &apos;s going .
thank you .
as steve lopez , the kolumnist of los angeles times , one day by the streets of los angeles , he listened to a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , sympathisch , rough , homeless , who played on a violin , who had two strings .
and a lot of you will know the story , because from steves articles about it was a book , by robert downey as a book , when steve lopez and jamie foxx , as steve ayers , the kontrabassisten , who was at the juilliard-konservatorium , and whose vielversprechende career , and his very promising career early through his paranoide schizophrenia .
nathaniel left also , suffered a nervenzusammenbruch , and 30 years later , he lived as a obdachloser row on the streets of skid row at the center of los angeles .
i recommend all of you , at reading book , or to look at the movie , so you can &apos;t just be able to understand the music between these two men , but also how the music made that link connection , and as you finally , if that &apos;s the instrument , if that &apos;s allowed to be able to get the mithalf , nathaniel away from the street .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney disney hall .
he just heard a picture of beethoven and fourth symphony symphony and came to the stage to me .
he was talking to a very heiteren and hillary ton , and hillary clinton and hillary clinton clinton and hillary , like the dodgers would never create it in baseball world series , and all of the tückischen passage of the first violin in the last sentence in the last sentence of fourth symphony .
we came to speak to music , and a few days later , i got an email , in which nathaniel , was interested in for geigenunterricht .
i &apos;ve got to say that nathaniel was a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electric and handschellen , a trauma that followed him his whole life .
now , as a result , he &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic stages , which are sometimes so bad , and it &apos;s going to go away in the streets of skid row , always in this horror and the folterqualen of his own mind .
and in exactly the same way , nathaniel was nathaniel , when we first class in the walt disney , concert hall started concert hall , and he had lost this irre in his eyes and worked completely .
he talked about invisible dämonen and smoke and about how someone wanted to poison him .
i was afraid , not meinetwegen , but i was afraid that he could sink up to one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship to the violin , when i began to talk about scale and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didaktischen geigenpädagogik .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven .
and while i played , i noticed that in nathaniels &apos;s eyes , there was a total change .
it was , as if he was under the impact of a invisible drug , a chemical reaction that a catalyst was my game .
nathaniels manischer anger turned into understanding , in a quiet curiosity and grace .
and as a miracle , he took his violin , and i began to play some clips of violinkonzerten , and then asked me to finish them : mendelssohn , tschaikowski , sibelius .
so we started talking about music , starting from stream on beethoven , brahms , bruckner and all the other bs , from bartók to esa-pekka salonen .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just know a enzyklopädisches knowledge about music , but with her also a tight personal relationship .
he was talking about her with a passion and an understanding that i &apos;d only know about my colleagues in the philharmonie of los angeles .
by playing music , and he was talking about music , verwirrten , verwirrten , who had moved through the streets of the streets of los angeles , a liebenswerter , gebildeter , great , ausgezeichneter musicians .
music is medicine . music changes us .
it means music is emotional health .
because the music allows him to be thought of his mind with the help of his imagination and creativity into something real .
and so he entflieht its quälenden conditions .
i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
so this is why we do music : so we do something that in all of us , in all of us , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity of reality .
and the reality that that expression is all going to reach us all , and it moves , inspired and united together .
what nathaniel anging , so he brought him back into a community of friends .
the erlösende force of music took him back into a family of musicians who recognized his talent and achtete him .
and i &apos;m going to be again with nathaniel music , whether in the walt concert hall or in skid row , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i have stolen the cellisten .
i hope you forgive me .
so i knew a lot of fish in my life .
i only have two loved .
this first , it was more like a passionate affäre .
it was a beautiful fish , wohlschmeckend , good konsistenz , gehaltvoll , a bestseller on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it was in aquakultur after the angeblich standards of sustainability .
so you could feel about selling him .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
one day the head of the company called and asked if i could tell you about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , i said .
so here was a company that was trying to solve what was this unimaginable problem for our chefs , how do we keep fish on our speisekarten ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve geschlagen the oceans as we wälder forests .
it &apos;s hard to überbewerten the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the heilbutte , the lachse , schwertfisch , they collapsed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , oder , or übel , fischanbau , fischanbau , part of our future .
a lot of arguments against it . fischzuchtanlagen , most of you know , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a futterverwertung from 15 to one .
that means , 15 pounds of wildfisch are required to get a pounds of zucht-thunfisch .
not very sustainable .
doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so here finally was a company that was trying to do it right .
i &apos;d supported them .
in front of the day , i called the head of öffentlichkeitsarbeit for the company .
let &apos;s call it .
don &apos;t i said , &quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; only to have the facts , you &apos;re famous , you &apos;re famous for that you don &apos;t verschmutzt the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we are so far out that the waste is spread from our fish , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this futterverwertung of 2.5 to one . he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what feeds you ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great &quot; i said .
and that night i was in bed , and i thought , what is a deep protein protein protein ?
so i called the next day , in front of the event , in front of the event .
i said , &quot; don , for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to guess .
now , i telefonierte with a couple of people in the company . nobody could give me a ordentliche answer , until i finally finally , to the end of biologists .
let &apos;s call him don also .
&quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
now , he mentioned some algae algae and some fischmehle , and then he said , hühnchen-pellets .
i said , &quot; hühnchen-pellets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , federn , skin , skin , reste , reste , getrocknet and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of this is chicken ? &quot;
maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what &apos;s sustainable to feed of fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i &apos;m entliebte myself from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a selbstgerechter genießer and gutmensch .
that &apos;s me .
no , i actually have micht from this fish , because , i swear to god who tasted fish after chicken chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way that you know , the better you learn your fish , you love the fish .
i was eating him first in a restaurant in südspanien .
a befreundete journalist had spoken for a long time of this fish .
it &apos;s kind of verkuppelt us .
he came on the table with a light , almost schimmernden white color .
the chef had verkocht him .
wait twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish as well as he was verkocht ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , he &apos;s called miguel .
and no , he doesn &apos;t have the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that you and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
this is a fischaufzucht in the südwestlichen corner of spain .
it &apos;s close to the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentiniern .
they raised fleischrinder on what they were feuchtgebiete .
they did this by entwässerten the country .
they built these complicated consequence of channels , and they kept drängten water from the land and beyond the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t do that , not economic .
and ökologisch was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds around what &apos;s a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company has bought the country .
what did they do ?
you have the flow of the water .
they literally have the lever .
instead of using the water herauszudrängen , they used the channels to hereinzuziehen the water again .
they fluteten the channels .
they created a 11.000 acres of fischaufzucht -- barsch , meeräsche , shrimp , aal -- and they have miguel and his company the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
they stare out on the horizon that &apos;s a million miles away , and everything you see is geflutete channels of channels , and this density march march .
i didn &apos;t have a long time ago .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a part of &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and we fought by the feuchtgebiete and i keuche and schwitze , and have matsch up to my knee , and miguel is a biologievorlesung .
here he lifts a rare gleitaar .
now , he mentioned the mineralbedürfnisse of space .
and here , he sees a pattern of concentrate that reminds him to the tansanische giraffe .
it turns out that miguel has spent the biggest part of his career in the mikumi national park in africa .
i asked him how to be a fisch-experten .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and stürzt into more talk about rare birds and algae and weird wasserpflanzen .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotische community , like this .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this verkochte piece of köstlichen fish that i had on the vorabend .
so i stopped him . i said , &quot; miguel , how does your fish enjoy so good ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what are your fish ?
what is the futterverwertung ? &quot;
now , he continued to tell me that it &apos;s a rich system that the fish are eating what they were going to eat in the wild .
the pflanzliche biomass , the space , the zooplankton , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally selbsterneuernd .
there &apos;s no food .
the one of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
the day i went on on this site on this site , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be like that , &quot; unlike any farm that i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot;
in the moment it was as if a film director would have a bühnenwechsel .
and we bow around the corner , and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands and thousands of flamingos , a literally pinker carpet carpet .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your bäuche , pink .
they schlemmen . &quot;
schlemmen ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; miguel , don &apos;t you schlemmen your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fischeiern to the birds .
well , last year , on this site were 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s been the biggest and one of the most important private private vogelreservate in europe .
i said , &quot; miguel , is a good gedeihender vogelbestand , not the last thing you want to have on a fischaufzucht ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building extensiv , not hard .
this is a ökologisches network .
the flamingos eat shrimp .
the shrimp eat the space .
the pinker pinker of the gut the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this : a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals and a farm that measure your success to your success .
a fischaufzucht , but also a vogelreservat .
oh , and by the way , these flamingos shouldn &apos;t even be there .
they breed in a city 240 kilometers , where the bodenbeschaffenheit is better for the nestbau .
every morning they fly 240 miles to a mile .
and every night they fly zurück miles .
they do that because they can follow the gestrichelten white line of landstraße .
seriously .
i had imagined a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at miguel .
and i said , &quot; miguel , fly , fly for kilometers to the farm , and then they &apos;re going to go back 240 away ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
and he looked at me when i had just a song from whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fischhaut . i don &apos;t like it sautiert . i don &apos;t like knusprig .
it &apos;s this beißende , verkohlte taste .
i cook almost never cook .
and yet , when i tried her in this restaurant in südspanien , she didn &apos;t geschmeckt it at all .
she liked sweet and in fact , as if you would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned that to miguel and he nickte .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last abwehr , before something goes into the body .
it &apos;s evolved throughout evolution to unreinheiten aufzusaugen . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no unreinheiten . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your fish , a farm that is measuring your success .
and then i realized when he says , if he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have any unreinheiten , he &apos;s enormous , because the water that comes through this farm comes in from the river guadalquivir .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things to all the things that are rivers all the things that are going to be rivers today , they tend to lead chemical pollutants , flow of schädlingsbekämpfungsmitteln .
and if it worked through the system , and this leaves is a clean , the water as it is hereingekommen .
the system is so healthy , it reinigt the water .
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their own , not only a farm that is measuring their success to their success , but a farm that &apos;s literally a wasser-aufbereitungsanlage , and not just for those fish , but for you and me .
because when the water herausfließt , it versinkt in the atlantic .
one drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take him , and you should do that , because this love story , as romantic also , is aufschlussreich .
you might say you &apos;re a recipe recipe for the future , whether we &apos;re talking about barsch or fleischrindern .
now what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , actually taste in food .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
we &apos;re not realisten , we &apos;re genießer . we are lover .
we love wochenmärkte . we love little familienbetriebe . we &apos;re talking about local food . we eat organic .
and if you say that that &apos;s the things that the future of good food , is somebody somewhere , and says , &quot; hey people , i love pinke flamingos , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;ve already producing enough calories to feed the world more than only feed .
one billion people are born today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of krasser inequalities in the distribution , not the gesamtproduktion .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because she has the logic of our nahrungssystems the last 50 years .
feed grain , schädlingsbekämpfungsmittel , in monokulturen , in monokulturen , chemikalien , chemicals on the earth , chicken in fish , and the whole time has said , &quot; if we have more people cheaper , how awful can that ? &quot;
this was the cause . it was the rechtfertigung . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
and we should call them what she is , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , schnell capital , which is what makes this production .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our kornkammer is threatened today , not because of abnehmender zufuhr , but because of abnehmender resources .
not through the latest mähdrescher- and traktor-erfindungen , but by fertile land , not by pump , but by frisches water , not by kettensägen , but by forests , and not by fischerboote and nets , but through fish in the sea .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agrarindustrie-modell for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are obenan , and it never made something really good to eat .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is that for two billion years of arbeitserfahrung zurückgreift .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
businesses that are not in the worlds for themselves , businesses that are not going to be welten worlds , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , betriebe .
because they are the ones who are also experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;ll ever be .
you know , that &apos;s right to me , because if that &apos;s good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
so if i want to show you one thing today is that the total of the data we consume , greater than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking about it , i want to think about how we use information as we use information that patterns produce patterns , and we see trends would not be visible .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical period of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pivot , and what i can do with pivot is that i can filter after a particular cause of cause , let &apos;s say to accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes itself .
and that &apos;s because in mittelbereich here , people are mainly active and they &apos;re here on the gebrechlichsten .
we can take a step further out , and you can see the data and see the data and see that kreislauferkrankungen and cancer are the usual feeling , but not for everybody .
now , when we go out and go back to age , let &apos;s say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are even the main cause that people should worry about .
and who &apos;s going to see weiterforscht is that &apos;s especially among men .
so you realize that this is the information and data in this way in this way in a living informationsgrafik .
and if we do this for raw data , why not even for content ?
now , what we have here is the titelbilder of every single sport illustrated that has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you like to test it after my talk .
with pivot them in a decade in a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now , if i look here , i see the athlete that appear in this copy and the sportarten .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i click here , so i &apos;m going to take a lot of that i &apos;m going to show in the hierhin armstrong .
now , if i &apos;d like to get a gröberen überblick , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at anything with the subject of fahrradfahren ? &quot;
so i go back and take a step back .
now i see greg lemond .
and so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , gezielter , wider , wider , rauszoomen , then you don &apos;t seek or not just surft .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it &apos;s changing the way that information can be used .
i want to take this idea a little bit about what a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is , we took every single wikipediaseite , and it &apos;s reduced to a little summary .
the summary contains a short show and a symbol of the area that it comes from .
i just show the top 500 of the populärsten wikipediaseiten .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are at wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the government &apos;s theme .
well , after i chose &apos; government &apos; government , i know that the wikipediakategorien , which are at most of the time at the time of the year .
this is really important , because this is a realization that is not in a single wikipediaseite .
that &apos;s just to recognize a step back and look at the whole .
now , in a certain one of these summaries , i can go into the field of time , &quot; people of the year &quot; people go in and see all together .
now if i look at all these people , i realize the majority of them are regierungsbeamte . some people come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss , and one comes from the musikbereich .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can jump and take a look at all of the ted prize .
you can see , we &apos;re focusing on the net the first time as if it &apos;s really a net , not just side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what else could be a little surprise .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times the website .
pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with it -- and we bring these zoom-technologie to every single website like this .
so i can go back one step back , and you can jump directly to a specific sektion .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s important , because you only look through the look at the face of websites in this way , all the way you can look at the same way .
so i can zoom into my course in a particular place .
so here is the entire demonstration that i &apos;ve thought to here .
and i can sort of look at everything i &apos;ve been looking at now , again .
and when i take a step back and i look at everything , i can actually cross my way after my such-vergangenheit , maybe i went to &apos; nepotistisch , i went to &apos; nepotistisch , or here after a live to live labs .
and from here , i can go into the side and go back to them .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used again , and every time it makes it bigger than the sum of the datenteile .
at the moment , in this world , we think that data is a fluch .
we &apos;re talking about the top of the informationsüberflusses .
we talk about drowning in information .
what if we could turn that situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of walking from one to the other , we start to go from many things to many things , and to see patterns that would otherwise be hidden ?
if we can do this , then it &apos;s going to be datenfalle , perhaps a new source of information .
and instead of moving into the information , we can know that .
and if we know , maybe we can actually draw weisheiten from it .
so i hear , thank you very much .
i grew up with a gehörigen portion of fiction .
in my high school , i went to school every day an hour every day .
and my nose always put it in a book , a science-fiction-buch , which my thoughts in other worlds , in a sense of andere my deep in me , sitzende , in my deep , unersättliche , unersättliche .
so this curiosity curiosity also showed that i was always , if i wasn &apos;t in school , in the forests , and &quot; samples , &quot; specimens , &quot; collected , &quot; and snakes beetles and teichwasser , and teichwasser , everything home and looked at home .
i was completely wissenschaftsbegeistert , you know .
it was always around trying to understand the world and explore the boundaries of possible .
and my love too science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment , because then in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world full of wonder we &apos;ve never had before .
so that probably has very good at this science-fiction-rolle .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since it &apos;s not a video games with computergenerierten , the whole imagery of the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
that &apos;s what we had to do at the time when we read a book , if we read a book , we took the description of the description of the autors in our heads .
and my reaction was to draw and paint by aliens , alien worlds , robots , raumschiffen and all this .
i was constantly caught by the teacher all the time , like me , in hidden textbook , herummalte .
the creativity had to be irgendwie .
and what happened to something interesting , which was interesting to me about jacques cousteaus shows , was the thought of an entirely unknown world here on our earth itself .
i certainly would never reach an alien world with a spaceship . that seemed pretty unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually enter , on the earth , and she was just as fascinating and exotic like all of what i &apos;d always imagined when i read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 to become diver .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the next ocean .
i didn &apos;t let myself frustrated .
i nervte my father , until he finally got a tauchschule in buffalo , new york , which had done , on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my tauchschein in a pool in the middle of the winter in the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , the real ocean , i had only got to face a face later when we moved to california .
since , in the 40 years now , in the 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 25,000 hours of water , 500 hours of it .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flacheren oceans , is so rich of faszinierendem life , how we really hardly imagine .
nature &apos;s imagination doesn &apos;t know borders , unlike our own , kläglichen human imagination .
for today , i have the deepest awe awe for today , what i see on my tauchgängen .
and my love for the ocean is holding with the same intensity as ever .
so when i was an adult , then as an adult , it was the filmemachen .
that seemed to be the best way to tell stories to tell stories , with my need to unite .
as a child , i drew books around and so .
so films were the way of the way , images and stories . that fit together .
of course , the stories i &apos;m aussuchte from , from the science-fiction-bereich , from the science-fiction-bereich , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; aliens &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
in &quot; abyss , &quot; i was able to connect my predilection for the unterwasserwelt , and we go to the filmemachen .
so , the kind of my two passions .
something interesting happened to &quot; abyss &quot; : to solve a erzählerisches problem in this movie -- that we had to create such a kind of liquid wasserwesen -- we went to computergenerierte animation , cg , back .
what came out with was the first computergenerierte soft-surface-figur ever to see in a movie .
and the movie didn &apos;t have a money , in fact , in fact , he just played his produktionskosten , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was hypnotisiert from the magic that ended up from this .
according to arthur strains &apos;s law , you know , the law of the law and magic is not from each other .
so you saw something magical .
and i found that so exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this must be involved in filmkunst . &quot;
so we went to &quot; the movie 2 , &quot; my next film , a lot further .
together with ilm , we created the guy from liquid metal . the success on what this effect would be done .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve got a little bit more money with the movie .
from these two experiences , it was a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for filmschaffende .
so , i started a company , along with my good friend , who was the best make-up- and creature-designer , it was called &quot; digital domain . &quot;
the idea of this company was , the stage analog prozesse , etc , etc , etc , etc .
we also did that , and we managed to take a advantage of it .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the creature- and character-design -- which we actually started the company -- too slow .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; written in terms of visual effects and computergenerierter effects in a whole new heights , with realistic human characters , expressive characters who have been made by cg , and the hauptfiguren should be all the cg , and the world should be cg .
but the figure out pretty well . and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not supposed to be able to be able to be able to do that .
so i did that , and i did this other movie on the big ship that will fall .
so , i &apos;ve sold this as &quot; and juliet and juliet on a ship , &quot; it was sold to a liebesfilm scale , a passionate movie .
but in fact , i wanted to hinabtauchen the real wrack of titanic .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
i &apos;ve convinced them , but i said , &quot; we go to the train . we film the real track .
we &apos;ll show it in the eröffnungssequenz of the movie .
that &apos;s tremendously important . it &apos;s a good aufhänger for marketing . &quot;
and i talked to finance an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this is back again that your imagination can create a reality .
we actually created a reality that i put myself in a russian tauchboot wiederfand , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i was looking at the real titanic through a bullauge .
this was not a movie , no hd , that was real .
so , that really umgehauen me .
and the amount of preparation was huge . we had to build cameras and light and everything .
and i fell on how much these tiefseetauchgänge , a weltraummission similar .
well , they were also hochtechnisch and bedurften planning .
you go up into these capsule , you put it into this dark , feindselige environment , where no hope is to save , if you don &apos;t even make it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just like i &apos;m in a science-fiction-film .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really kind of studying the study of the deep sea .
anyway , from the part of doing with curiosity and science , it was all . it was an adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that i couldn &apos;t give .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature where we could do a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the fensters .
in some of the following expeditions , i saw creatures in thermalquellen , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen , sometimes , sometimes , that nobody had seen before , and for the science of the science when we saw them didn &apos;t find any words .
so that &apos;s really umgeworfen me , and i wanted more .
and so i met an unusual decision decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my hauptberuf as a filmmaker in hollywood as a filmmaker in hollywood and will be vollzeit-forscher for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we came to the bismarck , and they were exploring them with roboterfahrzeugen .
we went back to the head of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which was a fiberglaskabel abwickelten .
our intent was , hineinzutauchen and the inside of the ship , which has never been done before .
no one had explored the inside of the wracks , and you had no resources for it . so we developed technology .
well , i &apos;m sitting on the deck of titanic , in a tauchboot , and see planken , who are pretty similar to this brettern , and i know that once the band has played there .
and i fly with a little roboterfahrzeug through the gänge of the ship .
i think it &apos;s actually , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i put present in the schiffswracks of the titanic of the titanic .
this was the surrealste form of a déjà-vu that i &apos;ve ever experienced . because before i took an bog , i &apos;ve always knew what was going on in the lichtkegel of the vehicle of the vehicle , because i went for months of filmset , when we turned the movie .
so the set was a direct copy of the baupläne of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
and she made me realize that you can use that you &apos;re using solch avatare , and so your own consciousness in the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
it was really incredibly profound profound .
and perhaps a small view of what might happen in a few decades , if you have cyborg-körper to study something or to do other things , in all kinds of post-humanen zukunftszenarios that i can imagine as a science-fiction-fan .
so after these expeditions , we started to learn what we &apos;ve been seeing at the bottom , for example , for example , the tiefseequellen , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals that &apos;s sort of alien , but here on earth .
they live with the help of chemosynthese .
they don &apos;t exist in one on the sunlight , as we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also very interested in the same time , which was back from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who have been interested in space , and we ended up with nasa , and they &apos;re going to go to russia , going through the mission in front of the mission in front of everything , and then they go to the international record , and then they go to international weltraumstation and take our 3d-kamerasysteme .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was going to be that i took weltraumwissenschaftler to the deep sea .
i took them access to the world down there , astrobiologen , planetenwissenschaftler , leute , people who were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources , so they could take a look , take samples and test instruments and so on .
so we did dokumentarfilme , but in fact , in fact , in fact , wissenschaft .
so the circle of my existence , as a child , as a child , and the way in the reality .
so over the course of this voyage , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure now , you must have a director , you have to be able to be able to be a leader or something like that .
i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i antrat these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s coming out ? &quot;
these blöden films don &apos;t give us a money .
we &apos;re just playing the cost of the produktionskosten . from fame .
everyone thinking , i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar avatar , &quot; and i would have nägel on a towel towel on a towel on a towel .
i &apos;ve all got these movies , these dokumentarfilme , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re doing it about the task , the challenge -- and the ocean is the herausforderndste environment , which is there . you are doing it because of the funny connection , and because of the funny connection that comes when a small group of people form a team .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who &apos;ve been working on for years , sometimes we were two to three months back in a row .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing that you have is , you have overcome each other , because you have overcome a job that you can &apos;t explain any other .
and when you go back to land , you know , the fiberglas , you know , , you know , you know , the ganze , the schallschwächung , you know , you know , the ganze , you know , you know , you can &apos;t just explain the other . this is like policemen or soldiers that have gone through in common and know that you can never explain somebody .
there &apos;s a connection , a different respect .
so when i came back to make my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you respect your team and deserves its respect .
so this was really changing the dynamic .
so again , i stood back with a small team on unbekanntem terrain terrain , we made &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that hasn &apos;t been before .
so exciting .
an awful challenge .
and we became a half a half a half years to a viereinhalb .
and this changed my way to make movies , completely .
there were people who were like , we had this ozeanwesen , really gut , and on the planet on the planet .
for me , it was more a prinzipielle way to do my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we conclude from all of this ?
what lessons are we learned ?
i think first , the curiosity is .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the achtung of your team is more important than all the lorbeer of this world .
to me come young filmmaker who say , &quot; give me a advice , how i can do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t you yourself .
you get another one for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , you don &apos;t bet yourself , but take risks for you . &quot;
nasa has such a lieblingssatz : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in the art and in the art , you have to study an alternative , because you certainly guarantee it .
no important endeavor , the innovation , the innovation was the risk without risk .
you have to be ready to take those risks .
this is the idea i &apos;d like to give you to the way . failure is an alternative , fear , but not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and that may be surprised something , because my vollzeitbeschäftigung at the foundation are mainly around vaccines and seed to make the things that we have to do and deliver the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than any other on the planet .
klimaverschlechterung means that their saaten will not grow over many years , we &apos;re not going to grow too much or too little rain , and things will change the way it can &apos;t sustain their fragile environment .
that leads to hungersterben . it leads to unruhen .
so , the climate change for you .
and then the energiepreis is very important for them .
the fact is that if you could reduce only one thing about the price , energy would be done by far the most effective .
well , the energiepreis is over time .
in fact , the fortschrittsgesellschaft is based on energiefortschritten .
the kohlerevolution drive the industrial revolution and even even in the 20th century , there was a rapiden case in the elektrizitätspreis , and so we have refrigerators , klimaanlagen , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s put the price in half -- let &apos;s meet a new barrier , and that barrier depends on co2 .
co2 warming and the equation and the equation of co2 is actually quite clear .
she summieren the ausgestoßene co2 co2 , which leads to the temperaturerhöhung , and this temperaturerhöhung has some very negative consequences . effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , the indirekte consequence , that the natural ecosystems are not able to adapt and somit systems .
well , the exact context between a co2-anstieg and the dadurch temperaturveränderung , and where they are more consequences , there are some questions , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly unklarheit about how bad these consequences are . but they will be extremely bad !
i asked the top-wissenschaftler several times , &quot; do we really have to get down to zero ?
not half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a 3.5 feet away , which has to get under a three-year-old bridge bridge , and then you can put it in the way .
this has to go down to zero .
well , we &apos;re running a lot of kohlenstoffdioxid every year , over 26 billion tons .
every americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of everyone on the planet .
and somehow we have to make changes that are down to zero .
it &apos;s been a constant .
it &apos;s only different economic changes at all , and we need to split from rapidem rise , and we need to a mess to zero .
this equation has four factors . you have this thing on the left -- it &apos;s carbon , you know , and you that will depend on the number of the number of people , from the service that any human being in the average , the average energy , the average energy , the average energy .
so let &apos;s look at each one factor , and we think about how we get it to zero .
probably one of these numbers must come very close to zero .
now this is fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first , we have the population .
today , 6,8 billion people .
and it schreitet to nine billion zu. to move to nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the gesundheitsvorsorgung and reproduktionsmedizin , we may be able to reduce it 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope for 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
it &apos;s all that &apos;s all the food we eat , clothing , television , heat .
these are very good things and armutsverringerung means to make the service almost everyone on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper world , we might be able to do abstriche and less , but average , this number will be higher every year , and so much more than double the number of services in the service per person .
here we see a very basic service service . is there at home , so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have , so they go out and read their schulaufgaben under the straßenlicht .
well , on efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there is finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
because of different successes in lichtsektor , by other autotypen , through other autotypen , through new ways in häuserbau , there are lots of services , there are a lot of services , that some of their energy , to reduce some individual .
in other service , like düngemitteln , 105 , 105 : 05 : 56,000 : &amp; : 05 : 05 : 58,000 , or luftverkehr , or luftverkehr , is the spielraum for improvements very much smaller .
in general , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe we get a reduction to a factor of three or maybe even about a factor .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;re now from 26 billion to maybe 13 billion tons , and it &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 , which is wird .
it turns out to be if you can get it to zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
almost every herstellungsmethode for electricity today is co2 , except the renewables and nuklearenergie .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energiewunder .
now , if i use the term &quot; wonder , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
and usually there &apos;s no deadline that you have to have a miracle to a particular date .
you &apos;re usually just wrong , and some of them are not .
but in this case , we have to be vollgas and get a miracle in a very short time .
well , i asked myself , how can i really deliver this ?
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that the notion of people here ?
i remember last year when i brought mosquitos , and somehow people liked that .
the idea was really tangible for them , you know that there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , this is one .
and i decided that &apos;s the back of my diesjähriger to the environment here .
so here are a few natural .
i told me that they don &apos;t bite . in fact , they don &apos;t even become the glass .
well , there are all kinds of spielereilösungen like this , but they all don &apos;t get a lot .
we need to need solutions , either , either one or a couple of them , you know , either one , and even though there are a lot of directions where people are looking for them , i actually see five that can afford these big demands .
i &apos;ve left , geothermal , fusion and biofuels .
it may be a moderaten contribution , and if you expect better than i expect , it would be great , but my favorite line here is that we have to have all of these five work , and we can &apos;t give up any of them , because they have significant , because they have significant problems .
let &apos;s first take the burning fossil fuels of either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do is seem to be simple , but that &apos;s not . you have to get all the co2 that comes out of the schornstein , to capture , under pressure , and then store somewhere , and hope that it stays there .
there are some pilotprojekte that are going to create 60 percent -- 80 percent of the level , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get in 100 percent , and an agreement for the lagerung of co2 is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the lagerzeitfrage .
who is going to make sure ?
who can guarantee you what literally , literally , many billion times bigger than any kind of waste that you can imagine and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a hard problem .
next , nuklearenergie .
they also have three big problems . the cost of all the time , especially in hochregulierten countries , that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human collaboration , the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of thinking .
so three very difficult problems that might be solved , and that &apos;s why you should work on .
the last three of the five of the five .
it &apos;s the renewables , as it &apos;s called a lot .
and also the -- even though it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need fuel -- you have some drawbacks .
one is the energy energy that these technologies are generating dramatically than kraftwerken .
these are energiefarmen , you &apos;re talking about many quadratkilometern times more than a normal power station .
and also , those sources of these sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all day , it doesn &apos;t seem to go every day , and the wind doesn &apos;t go all the time .
and so you have to be , if you depend on these sources , you have a way to have the energy in times if you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s great preisherausforderungen . there . there are challenges in the transmission , and if we say , for example , the source of the country is , you don &apos;t only need the technology ; you also have to deal with the risk of where the energy from where it comes from where it comes from .
and there &apos;s the lagerungsproblem .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve got all sorts of batteries , computers , computers , computers , computers , computers , mobile phones , taschenlampen , taschenlampen , for everything , and that &apos;s what the world uses , compared . i found that all batteries that we &apos;re producing now , less than 10 minutes of gesamtenergie .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be a factor of 100 better than the approaches of time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
that &apos;s what happens when you &apos;re trying to do these unterbrochenen sources , we say 20 percent -- 30 percent of the use .
if you want to support 100 percent on it , you need an incredible wunderbatterie .
now , where are we going to go , what &apos;s the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we go to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
they will say , they are crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group there are many who are already involved in there .
bill gross has multiple companies , among other things called the great solarthermaltechnologien .
vinod khosla invest in dozens of companies that have great things and interesting possibilities , and i try to support this .
nathan myhrvold , and i finance a company , which , maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the nuklearbereich , modular .
the development has stopped in this industry at some time ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts around it .
the terrapower-konzept means that instead of a part of the urans , which one percent , the u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never have been thinking about it before , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that , yes , you know , with the right materialienherangehensweise , it looks like this .
and because you burn this 99 percent , the kostenprofil is much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of today as antriebsstoff .
rather than break your head , you just burn it . a great thing .
so , the uranium is used to be used a little bit like a candle .
you see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often than &quot; traveling wave wave . &quot;
that really solve the treibstoffproblem .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned down today , so it &apos;s called aufgebrauchtes uranium .
the triebe the u.s. america for hundreds of years .
and if you get ozeanwasser and just filtriert , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges there , but it &apos;s an example of lots of concepts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how to measure our success .
what should we look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we have to do , and then we talk about the zwischenschritt .
a lot of talk about the 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and it &apos;s still a little agriculture , hopefully , is going to be clean up to be clean .
so , to reach these 80 percent , developed countries , including countries like china , umstellen their elektrizitätsgeneration .
the other note says whether we &apos;re using the null-emissionen technology , whether it &apos;s used in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is a key feature of this .
if we go back from there , what should that look like 2020 ?
it should be the two elements again .
we should use the effektivitätsmaßnahmen to provide reduction in the way , the less we do , the less the co2-summe will be co2-summe and also the temperature .
but in fact , this note is this note for the things that we are doing , not entirely to the large reduktionen , just the same , or even something less important like the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs breakthroughs .
we need to track these breakthroughs , and we can measure this : in firmenzahlen , in pilotprojekten and regulierungsänderungen .
there &apos;s a lot of great books .
and al gore &apos;s book , &quot; we have the choice , &quot; and david without energy the hot air air . &quot;
they really go through and create a framework where this can be discussing , because we need to have all sides .
there &apos;s some things that come together .
this is a wish .
a very konkreter wish that we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could pick the president , a vaccine , and the love that , or i could choose this wish , which is , halbierter without co2 , i would take this wish .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the dig between the long-term and kurzfristig people are terrible , between the united states and china , between poor and rich , and almost all the lives of these lives will be much worse .
so what do we have to do ?
for what do i do ?
we need to use it for more research .
when countries meet in places like koppenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
you should talk to these innovationsstrategie , and you would be shocked by the ridiculous for these innovative ways of innovative approaches .
we need marktanreize , controlling co2 , cap &amp; amp ; trade is making a preissignal .
we need to spread the message .
we need to be able to have a dialogue and the things that are going to be done by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand a little bit better -- can you have an idea of the scale of that investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , all the big scientists , all the great scientists , and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor reactor to make sure that it &apos;s sensible , you &apos;re only in the 100en million .
the hard step is to build the first of the first reaktors , to find other billion , the regularien and the place that actually build the first of it .
as soon as the first time , if it &apos;s going to run , it &apos;s all clear , because the infrastructure , the energy density is so different than nuklearenergie , as we know it .
in order to understand that , it means deep into the ground , almost like a vertical column nuclear brennstoffs , and then the process begins , and then the process begins , and then continued to go down ?
bg : right . now , you have to immer the reactor , you know , a lot of people and lots of controls that can go wrong . this thing , where you &apos;re opening it opens up and herausbringt or herausbringt , that &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can befüllen it for 60 years -- think about a plank -- you &apos;re buried in , without all of the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a nuklearreaktor , which is a solution to the trash .
bg : yeah . now , what happens to the trash : you can let him sit -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- you take it and put it into the next reactor , and you burn it on .
and we start by taking the waste that &apos;s already exists in this kühlbecken or trockenbehältern of reactors . that &apos;s our startbrennstoff .
so what these reactors is a problem , which is what we put in our fill , and it &apos;s going to be dramatically reduced through this process .
but while you &apos;ve talked to different people of this world about these possibilities .
where is the biggest interest in what really do ?
bg : well we haven &apos;t got a place yet , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting offenlegungsregeln for everything that &apos;s been in russia , india , india , india , china , china -- i was here , and i &apos;ve been talking about how this fits .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something that direction .
this is a version of the thing that was done .
this is a more important step ahead , but it &apos;s like a faster , and some countries built this , that &apos;s why everyone has done a quick reactor , a kandidatat for our first .
in their imagination , zeitrahmen and probability really was calling into life ?
bg : well we need one of these skalierbaren , stromgenerierenden things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years .
this is sort of a deadline that &apos;s the umweltmodelle that we &apos;ve got to follow .
and , you know , terrapower , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of companies , the same thing , if their new approaches that work for their pilots , works for their pilots .
and it would be best if it could get multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
do the great kind of breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
bg : a energiedurchbruch is most important .
that would have been without the umweltherausforderung , but it &apos;s so much more important .
in nuclear sector , there are other innovation .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s the modulare method , which is a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid reaktortyp that seems a little difficult , but maybe they say that about us .
and so , the beauty of a million times as much energy as a lot of energy , like one , and that &apos;s where you have to deal with the problems , and these are mainly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , plays the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in a league .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to introduce notfallmaßnahmen to keep the erdtemperatur stable stable ?
bg : when you come into this situation , it &apos;s as much as you eat too much , and you &apos;re going to be a heart attack . what you do ? you might need a herzoperation or similar .
there &apos;s a forschungsrichtung which is called geoengineering with various techniques , to verzögern warming , so we get 20 or 30 years longer around us .
this is just a versicherungsmethode .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you don &apos;t want to work on insurance because you &apos;re eating a lazy , that you eat , you eat , because you know that you &apos;re going to save the herzoperation .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if that &apos;s smart , if you go to the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have that to go faster , or that innovation needs to be more than we expect .
klimaskeptiker : do you have one or two sentences for you to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptic is in very different camps .
the ones who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there &apos;s negative effects to do with the clouds that are moving things ?
there are very , very few things that they can tell you that there are a chance in a million .
the hauptproblem here is something like aids aids .
you make the mistakes now , and you pay a lot later .
and so , if you have all kinds of dringenden problems , you know , you know , if you have all kinds of dringenden problems , where you &apos;re going to be able to invest in a little bit later , that the ipcc report is not necessarily not necessarily the worst thing , and there are people in the rich world who look at the ipcc and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty should be worried about .
but my dream here is , if you can do it economic , and at the same time the co2 , i wish , you know , i wish that it &apos;s not a emittiert , i wish that it &apos;s not emittiert , i wish that it did , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the björn argument that , if you use all of this time and energy to solve the co2 , the armutsverringerung , the armutsverringerung of malaria and so on that there is a dumb waste of resources to invest money , while there are better things that we can do .
bg : well , the real spending for the research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
it should not suffer other things .
you get to big geldsummen , and you can disagree with vernünftige people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and trying to fund that . for me , there is most of the waste .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very briefly in front of a kostendurchbruch , and i only funded the learning structure . i think we should try more things that have the potential to be very much more expensive .
if the abstrich that you get , it &apos;s a very high energiepreis , you can only keep the rich up .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times so much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even lomborg .
his new masche is now now , &quot; why don &apos;t research is talking about ? &quot;
it &apos;s still going to be , because of his former stories , with the skeptiker-camp , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why he does the forschungsargument .
and this is a thought that i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , like wenig .
bill , i think i &apos;m going to talk to almost all the people here , when i say , i really hope that your wish is true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter skillman asked a design-wettbewerb called &quot; the marshmallow-herausforderung . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . vierer-teams have to have to have the biggest freistehende structure with 20 spaghetti , about a meter tape , about three feet of thread and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on it .
and , even though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard , because people are doing very quickly .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design-workshop .
it was a huge success .
since i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students and architects and architects , even with the fortune-50-unternehmen , and there is something about this task , which enables deep sensations into the nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them with you .
and normally , most people start to orientieren themselves in the task .
you talk about it , you &apos;re thinking about what it &apos;s going to look like it .
then they &apos;re putting a little bit of time in planning and organization . they drawing and put spaghetti .
they &apos;re investing most of their time in the zusammenbau ständig structures .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have time , someone gets the marshmallow , and you put it very gently on the top , you get a step back and &quot; ta-da , &quot; ta-da . &quot; admire your job .
but then , almost always , what happens is that it &apos;s happened to &quot; ta-da &quot; uh-oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallows is that the whole thing is verbiegt and einstürzt .
there &apos;s a number of people who have much more &quot; uh-oh than others , and under the worst are frische .
they lie , they &apos;re cheating , they &apos;re confused , and they &apos;re producing dürftige shapes .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta-da , &quot; and under the best ones , sind are frische .
and that &apos;s quite amazing .
like peter told us peter , they didn &apos;t make the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking is : how does this happen ? why ? what about those ?
and peter tells you , &quot; none of the kids invest in the head of spaghetti . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in machtkämpfe .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s that bwl-studenten are trained to find a right plan , ok !
and then to realize it .
what happens if you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have a time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
so what kindergartenkinder do is that they start to start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that they &apos;ve got a few times the opportunity to fix prototypes .
konstrukteure recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of a iterativen vorgangs .
and with each attempt , the children get directly feedback from what works and what doesn &apos;t .
so it &apos;s the performance to work with prototypes , but let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
the average for most is about 50cm , bwl-studenten , and half of it , half of it , is a little bit more , but not much , kindergartenkinder are better than adults .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
three feet is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and sich-selbst-verstärkende geometric patterns are the key to build robust structures .
ceos are something about average , but here it will be interesting .
you &apos;re administrator an exekutive of the team , you become significant .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and recognize &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
because they have special skills of prozessbegleitung .
they run the process , they understand it .
and that team that are going down and the work in the work will improve the performance of the team .
spezialisierte skills and prozessfähigkeiten and their combination lead to success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical value , they get about six , they have about 6 structures .
i was trying to do something interesting .
i thought , we get the pokereinsatz .
so i offered a 10000 $ price for the winner .
what happened to these design-studenten ?
what was the result ?
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone had built a 2,5cm construction , he would have carried the price home .
so is it not interesting that high wetteinsätze have a strong effect ?
we repeated this practice with the same students .
what happened now ?
now they understood the advantage of the prototyping .
so the same , bad team , bad team .
they produced the highest construction of time .
so there are tief-greifende lessons for us , about the nature of drive and success .
you like questions : why would someone actually invest to create a marshmallow-challenge ?
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and &quot; visual effects . &quot;
and what the marshmallow-challenge is doing is , it helps you identify the hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a common experience , a common language , or a common language to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in it can go to marshmallowchallenge.com .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the marshmallows .
there &apos;s a schritt-für-schritt-anleitung there .
you find crazy examples from all the world , like people optimize the system and optimize .
there &apos;s also weltrekorde .
and the basale lesson , i think , is actually a verbindender sport .
it requires that we all put up our senses on the task , and that we think we think we think of our thinking , like our feelings and our do , in the challenge , in the challenge .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience , everything it needs to take us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; -- to a ta-da moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so let us do this as if we had a machine .
a big machine , a cool , ted-artige machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to be in .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in the future .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i asked my friends at the last question , and they all wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there was cars or twitter or &quot; america is the superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced you &apos;re sort of drawn to wunschdenken .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to be in the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a mammogram .
it &apos;s because people don &apos;t go back on this planet , go ahead .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the greatest time that have ever been on this planet , no matter how to scale it : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining krankheitsraten .
there was never a time before .
my ur-großeltern died all of them when they were 60 .
my grandparents kept out of this number .
my parents are 80 on the fersen .
so there should be a better one at the beginning of my todeszahl .
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a greater thing than that .
a child that is born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is this ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
they have shaped the demographics of the earth in a way , like no war .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we have bezwungen them . puff .
in the rich world there are diseases , the millions of us have threatened in front of one generation , hardly .
diphterie , röteln , kinderlähmung ...
does anybody know what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , it &apos;s scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is the scientific method to try things , if it works , change it , if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest great achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all the good news , because there &apos;s some other problems , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , one billion people on this world are hungry every day every day .
this number goes up , and it goes very fast , and it &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to verwüsten this world .
drinking country , rainforests , rainforests , oil , gas , gas : they disappear , and soon , and if we don &apos;t go out of this chaos , we disappear .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people , without the country that they live in .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t gleichzeitig .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a wunschdenken .
but this is holding me up at night -- one of the things that keep me awake at night . we &apos;ve never used scientific progress .
and we &apos;ve never been able to get it vernünftig , as we can do today .
we &apos;re in the verge of amazing , amazing events on lots of the enlightenment , and yet i really think that we would have to go back to the the enlightenment to find a time where we have progress in which we &apos;ve got to fight progress on these things , in more front of these things .
people are in their belief in their faith , and it &apos;s so closely that you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth is getting it out .
and listen , everybody has a right on his opinion ; even a right on his opinion of progress .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t have any right on their own facts . &apos; tschuldigung , they don &apos;t have .
and i took a while to figure that out .
about a decade ago , i &apos;ve written an article on impfungen for the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed to run on resistance , resistance to the resistance of what the most effective activity in the history is in human health .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i was doing , i was doing a paper and went on .
and soon , i wrote an article about genetically transformed food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were mad .
so i also wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why they believed that molecules were a certain kind of random kind of herumzuschieben in nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i went on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re going to eat , we &apos;re eating , that &apos;s okay .
but these papers made me worry , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i found it .
and that &apos;s because these fanatiker who were crazy , i didn &apos;t have fanatiker at all .
these were umsichtige people , rational people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that made me mess ...
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress like earlier .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking ironic about this , with little quotes : progress .
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what &apos;s reasons .
we have this trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it should not be .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
tschernobyl , bhopal , the challenger , mass weapons , mass destruction , the us-präsidentschaftswahl .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we thought we were always right . be skeptical .
ask questions , ask evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything .
but now it &apos;s : if you get evidence , you have to think that evidence evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can say that for the reason that we &apos;ve never seen in an epidemic of fear , like i &apos;ve never seen it , and hopefully never see again .
so about 12 years ago , a story was published in a story , a terrible story that autismus-epidemie the autismus-epidemie , mumps , and röteln vaccine .
very frightening .
tons of studies were done to see if that was true .
tons of studies should be done ; this is a serious deal .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , of england from sweden , from sweden , from sweden , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference . it doesn &apos;t make a difference , because we think of anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we can see what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents from a regierungsangstellten that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was a disaster .
disaster because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the impfrate is coming down for .
this is skandalös , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what happened is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i &apos;m doing that .
because then someone here ?
has one in the audience ever see someone dying ?
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
doesn &apos;t happen at all , in this country in this country in the last year .
these are many deaths of death , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not happening here , we can we see it , and people like jenny mccarthy can be able to walk out of fear of fear and analphabetismus of platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and you can do that because you can &apos;t connect the cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same .
and this is something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he befreite us from one of the worst geißeln of humanity .
no fear , no qualen , kinderlähmung , puff .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul offit .
he just developed with a few other people .
he can save the lives of 400- , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul &apos;s talking about vaccines , and they say how valuable are , and that people just should stop jammern .
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul talks to a public anhörung , he can &apos;t say without arms .
he gets calls home , because people like to tell him that they know where to go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
and you continue to go back to the diseases , terrible disease , and that &apos;s happening .
we &apos;ve been in this country now .
and it gets worse , and pretty soon , kids will die of it , because this is just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die in .
what about kinderlähmung ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
a kommilitonin of mine wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i said i &apos;m a little too schrill .
no one has said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against kinderlähmung . no way .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have kinderlähmung . and you know what ?
we had no kinderlähmung in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe there &apos;s someone in lagos in a plane today in an airplane , and fly after los angeles , at the moment he &apos;s about ohio ohio .
and in a few hours , he goes and mietet a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these fantastichen ted-dinner tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a lähmenden disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because that &apos;s how the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t as if it isn &apos;t .
we love to copy ourselves . we love that .
did you take all of your vitamins today ?
echinacea , a little antioxidantium that helps you to the jumps .
i know you &apos;ve done that , because half the americans do that every day .
they take the stuff , and they take a different alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they are useless .
the data tells you all the time .
they make their urine . they almost never do .
this is okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with them .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate to hassen government . we don &apos;t have trust .
and we don &apos;t do that . our healthcare system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s perfectly amazing , and seelentötend itself to us who can afford it .
so we go away before , and where are we going ?
we &apos;re running into the arms of the placebo-industrie .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo-industrie .
but you know , this is really a serious deal , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars .
and i have all kinds of little requisiten here .
none of it -- gingko , was , echinacea , betrug , betrug , i don &apos;t even know what this is , but we spend billions of dollars , it is .
and you know what ? when i say that , the people go to me and say , &quot; what do you care ? let people do what they want .
so they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the gesundheitsminister , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to not accept the evidence of my experts , &quot; or any krebs-quacksalber who wants to treat his patient with kaffe-einläufen .
if you go to this path , where you believe and magic and magic , you &apos;re going to replace a place that you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
he brought to a 400,000 of his people , because he was the red beete , knoblauch and zitronenöl as much more effective than antiretroviral drugs we know that they can stop the course of aids the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of unnötiger deaths in a country that will be worse than any of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the hirnloseste epidemic , in which we &apos;re right now , this is the absurde battle between the befürwortern gentechnisch food and the bio-elite .
this is a idiotische debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
everything that we eat , every reiskorn , every branch , petersilie , every rosenkohl , was verändert by people .
you know , there was no mandarinen in paradise .
there was no cantaloupe-melonen .
there was no weihnachtsbäume . we did it all .
we did it in the last couple of years .
and some of it doesn &apos;t work and some of them .
we have got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can make it more closely . and of course there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people to give their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we lehnen food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m constantly hearing is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monokultur , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent .
we don &apos;t want companies to make seeds .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . we fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge nahrungsproblem , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , patentkram .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , and sometimes the idea that we don &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid of a sackgasse , and it holds millions of people from the human .
you know , in the next 50 years , we will have to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
beschämend .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? genetically transformed food .
we don &apos;t want people to encourage people to eat this verrottete stuff , like maniok .
maniok is something that &apos;s a half a billion people .
it &apos;s like a kartoffel .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists build all this .
and then people could eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be chez panisse , but it would be beautiful .
and everything that i can say is , why do we fight that ?
i mean , we ask , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to have any genes ?
it &apos;s not about , genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insist on greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice krispies , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we continue to do this way , we &apos;re guilty about to something that we do , i think , not want to be guilty , high-tech .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we really have to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation you might want to say , &quot; you still want to take a time machine and go back into the future ? &quot;
anyway . i mean , anyway .
at the moment it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can hinbewegen them , where we want to hinbewegen them , and we will move them where we want .
we have to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time machine and go to the future , we &apos;ll be happy to have done .
i know we can , and as far as far as i am , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo-effekt . it might seem strange that a magician is interested in , because , you look at it &apos;s like me , as i say , &quot; a deception that &apos;s going to be real if someone thinks enough . &quot;
so in some studies in some studies , in some studies , there &apos;s an measurable impact in some studies in some studies , and it &apos;s just because the person is thinking about what &apos;s going on , if you , for example , in the schmerzmanagement , for example , for example , if the patient believes only enough of it , is a measurable effect in the body that &apos;s called the placebo-effekt .
a deception becomes something real , because somebody perceives it .
so we also want to understand each other , i &apos;m going to show you a fundamental , very simple magic .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has at least since the 1950s in every zauberbuch for children .
i even learned him from the cub magic magic of pfadfinder in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and explain him .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain him .
so , see what happens .
the knife that you can study ; my hand that you can study .
i &apos;ll just hold the knife in my hand .
i get back to my ärmel .
and to make sure that nothing in my ärmel goes out or out of him , i &apos;m just going to leave my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that no time is going to move anything , as long as i zudrücke here , nothing can go out of my ärmel .
and the goal is quite simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully if everything goes well , the knife gets held by my naked physical physical material .
in fact , it &apos;s so stuck on the place that i can shake it , without the knife .
nothing travels in my pets or comes out , no trickserei , and you can study everything .
ta-da !
well , this is a trick that i often care about little kids who are for magic , because you can learn very much about deception deception when you look closer , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
i probably know many of them in this room in the room .
it works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say , i umschließe my wrist to make sure that nothing in my pets disappears or comes out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason why i do my wrist is that there &apos;s the secret secret to the illusion .
now , in the moment , where i wegdrehe my hand , so you &apos;re going to look at the back , so you can see this finger here , you know , you know , just where he was , in a position that he &apos;s so ausgestreckt .
great trick ?
in the back in the back there , who had no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i umdrehe , the finger changes its position .
and now you can talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there is only three fingers at the bottom , and the way it is the way that it uses information , not one thing , one , two , three , but you see as a group .
but that &apos;s not really what it &apos;s about now , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s going to break it out there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my zeigefinger , who &apos;s now there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing happens to me is the same thing , by this movement , is hidden through this movement that the finger is verborgen .
i take this hand away , and here &apos;s the knife .
so this trick your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo-effekt ?
in front of a year , i read a study that really umgehauen me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researcher , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing for me .
this is what it turns out : if you provide a placebo in the form of a white pill in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a certain effect .
but if you take the shape that you give it to placebo , for example , going into a smaller pill , and you change that blue and you see that blue color , it &apos;s actually measurable more effective .
and that , although none of these pharmazeutische -- it &apos;s just zuckerpillen .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really made me out .
but it turns out it &apos;s not all .
if you take tiny , they are more effective than pills any shape .
a colored capsule that is yellow at one end and the other red is better than a white capsule .
it &apos;s also a role .
a pill twice a day , not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics now . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is ...
-- that also the dosierungen a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo-effekt , you have to grab the needle .
right ? a syringe with a wirkungslosen -- a syringe with a wirkungslosen substance that you put into a patient .
that creates a very strong picture in your head . that &apos;s much more powerful than a white pill .
this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a system .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill , which is not as good as a capsule that works as well as the needle .
and none of that has any really pharmazeutische property . it &apos;s just our belief in the way that we get a stronger effect in us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for magic .
i take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let it look real .
we know from this study that you have to reach to a needle if it &apos;s to go to the thing .
this is a 18 inches long hutnadel . it &apos;s very , very spitz . and i &apos;m going to start with you a little bit of it .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not damians special gezüchtetes meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin and take it through it , until you go back to the other side .
if you &apos;re übel -- if you fall out of it , i &apos;ve taken a few friends in the hotel room last night , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and it has become almost powerless .
so i propose if you &apos;re going to be übel , then you see for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first sensitive part here .
you can see it as well , but you can also wegsehen when you want .
so , right here , where my flesh starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little einstich .
am i sorry . does you crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in messertrick .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , well , well .
i know what people think when you see this .
they say , &quot; okay , this is not so stupid and durchsticht itself , just to talk a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people back in the back , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this right . &quot;
people in the nebenräumen come in now .
so let me show you outside .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can do it .
sorry . if you &apos;re übel , look away , look away , don &apos;t look .
and the people in the back of a video later , they &apos;re going to say , &quot; well , well , this is a pretty impressive , but if it &apos;s real , he would -- see , you know , here &apos;s a hole , and if it &apos;s really real , it would bleed . &quot;
okay , let me just give you a little blood .
yeah , here it is .
i would usually take the needle out .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wunden .
but i think , in this frame here , and with the purpose of a deception , i &apos;m just going to leave the needle in there and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to have a few days in the next days .
i hope you &apos;re happy . thank you .
everybody talks about happiness today .
i have some people the number of books that are published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 40 , and there was a lot more .
there are a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of glücks-coaching .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these tide of work , there are multiple cognitive ones that are kind of impossible to be able to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly going to act by these cognitive .
this is true for laien to think about your happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists think about happiness , because it turns out that we &apos;re just like everybody else .
the first one of these fallen is a widerstreben , complexity .
it turns out that the word is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could handle it , but in the large , and it &apos;s something that we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to think of the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is a sense of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s going to be between happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both zusammengeworfen in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the konzentrations-illusion , and this is the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that affects well-being , without its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a story of a story . &#91; unclear ... &#93; he said , he heard a symphony , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and at the end of the recording , there was a fürchterliches geräusch sound .
and then he added , really emotional , really emotional , that has the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it ruins was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
they didn &apos;t count because he was a memory , and the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had .
what really tells us is that we could think about other people in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s a erlebendes self that lives in the present and the present is able to experience the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the erlebende self that the doctor anpricht -- you know , if the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt now when i anfasse them here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a erinnerndes self , and the erinnernde itself is that the mitzählt , and the story of our life , and it &apos;s that the doctor &apos;s going to go to the doctor by saying , &quot; how did you feel at the last time ? &quot;
or , &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something .
these are two very different units , the erlebende self , and the erinnernde self , and the two of the durcheinanders is part of the durcheinanders of happiness .
well , the erinnernde itself is a storyteller .
and this is starting with a basic response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we &apos;re not just telling stories when we do to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories that means what we can keep with our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients that come from a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go to the detail . it &apos;s not more painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asking , &quot; who of them have suffered more ? &quot;
and this is a very simple question .
patient b has clearly suffered more likely . his darmspiegelung was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a single patient had patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question , &quot; how much did these patients think they suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient a much worse to the darmspiegelung had a much worse .
the stories of the darmspiegelungen were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories are very erbaulich or great -- but one of them is this clear .
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the one that is worse , where the pain was at the end at the end of his peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to be asked , and also much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a as for b in erinnrung .
now , this is a direct conflict between the erlebenden self and the erinnernden itself .
from the erlebenden self , b clearly had a inferior time .
well , what you could do with a patient &apos;s patient , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s been done , you could actually make the darmspiegelung of the patient a verlängern by simply rütteln the tube without very rütteln .
this is going to lead to the patient &apos;s patient , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve done that the erlebende itself is a worse , and you do it that the erinnernde itself is a much better off , because now you have given a patient a better story about its experience .
so what &apos;s a story ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that make memory , and it &apos;s also true for the stories we invent .
so , what a story is changed , important moments and end .
it &apos;s very , very important , and in this case , the end of the end .
well , the erlebende itself lives continuously .
it &apos;s got moments of the erlebens , one after another .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i want to do this -- you know , the psychological present , which means , you know , in a life about 600 million of them , there &apos;s about 600,000 . most of you don &apos;t leave .
most of them are completely ignored by the erinnernden self .
and yet , you kind of the impression that you should count that what happens during these moments of the erlebens .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use while we are in the world .
and as we use them , it would seem to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the erinnernde self for us .
so we have the erinnernde self and the erlebende self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is about time .
from the view of the erlebenden self , when you have a holiday , and the second week , as well as good as the first , the zweiwöchige holiday is twice as well as the einwöchige holiday .
that &apos;s how it doesn &apos;t work for the erinnernde itself .
for the erinnernde self , a zweiwöchiger holiday is hardly better than the einwöchige holiday because there are no new memories .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , there &apos;s time the critical variable , which is a erinnerndes itself from a erlebenden itself . time has very little influence on this story .
well , the erinnernde itself makes more than remember and to tell stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you &apos;ve got a patient , because if you have a patient , because if you should choose to choose , it &apos;s the one who has to vote who has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be selected .
the erlebende itself has no voice in this choice .
we actually don &apos;t choose between experiences . we choose between memories of memories .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think about our future as a experiences .
we think about our future as a vorausgesehene memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyrannei of the erinnernden self , and you can think of the erinnernde self as one , which is sort of the erlebende self through experience that doesn &apos;t need the erlebende itself .
i have the impression that if we &apos;re doing this a holiday , very often , that means we &apos;re taking a vacation on the service of the erinnernden itself .
and that &apos;s a little bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that is given to the dominance of the self .
and if i think about this , i think on a holiday that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in antarctica , the best holiday i &apos;ve ever had , and i think about a lot of times in relation to how often i think about other urlaube .
and i &apos;ve probably got my memories to this dreiwöchige journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i &apos;ve opened the folder with the ordner , i spent another hour .
well , that &apos;s three weeks , and that &apos;s a half hours .
there seems to be a prisoner .
well , i may be a little extreme , you know , like little appetite i have on the zehren of memories , but even if you &apos;re making more of it , there is a real question , why we give a memory so much weight on the weight of the weight that we &apos;re going to find ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next holiday , you know , at the end of the urlaubs , all of your pictures are vernichtet , and you get a amnestisches drug so that you &apos;re not going to remember anything .
well , would you choose the same holiday ?
and if you &apos;re going to choose another holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two of the self , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think of time , you get an answer , and if you think of memories memories , you might have a different answer .
why we choose the urlaube choose that we chose is a problem that &apos;s a choice between the two types of self .
well , the two kinds of self throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the erlebende self ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the moments in the life &apos;s lives ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea from the happiness of the erlebenden itself over time .
if you &apos;re good for the glück of the erinnernden self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy person lives .
it &apos;s like happy or pleased to be the person &apos;s person thinking about her life .
very different term .
everybody who &apos;s not going to distinguish these terms of happiness , and i &apos;m one of a lot of researchers over well-being who have been starting to explore this kind of happiness .
the distinction between the happiness itself and the happiness of the erinnernden itself has been recognized in the last couple of years , and now you &apos;re planning to measure the two separat .
the gallup organization has a worldwide survey , in the more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and think about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started to learn about the happiness of the self .
and the main lesson that we are , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy somebody with his life , and it doesn &apos;t teach them a lot about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about .5 .
what that means is that if you meet somebody and you would say , oh , his father is a zwei-meter-mann , how much would you know about its size ?
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody has his life as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his erlebenden self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what the happiness is defined .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know happiness is mostly to be happy with people who we like time to spend time with people we like .
there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you try to maximize the happiness of the self , they &apos;re going to be doing very different things .
and the conclusion from what i said here is that we really don &apos;t really want to imagine happiness as a ersatz for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , the other reason , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same thing when we think about life , and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not going to get the right answer .
if you think of this question , you know , if you &apos;re going to think that people in california , you know , in ohio .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference , say , in climate .
well , it turns out climate is not very important for the erlebende itself , and it &apos;s not even very important for the nachdenkliche self that decides how happy people are .
now , because the nachdenkliche itself is responsible , you can end up -- some people could draw to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track what happens to people who are moving to california , happier .
well , your erlebendes itself will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier because if you &apos;re going to think about that &apos;s what the weather weather the weather in ohio the weather in ohio in ohio , and you will feel that you &apos;ve made the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question to you .
thank you .
now , when we talked a couple of weeks ago , they talked to me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this place .
is this something that you can get involved in , because you have now a few minutes left ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we &apos;ve found in the gallup survey is a number that we had absolutely not to find .
we found this in terms of the glück ourselves .
if we looked at how emotions vary to the income .
and it turns out that under a income income in 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a great representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year are people unhappy , and they &apos;re increasingly getting more unhappy , the poorer , the poorer .
we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw flat lines .
what happens is , obviously , that money doesn &apos;t get a erlebnis-glück , but that lack of money certainly can get miserable , and we can measure this misery very , very clearly .
in the sense of the other self , the erinnernden self , you get another story .
the more money you deserve is you .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , in the entire american effort , is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take these befund seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , all that we believe , for example , for example , and so on .
is there a chance to say that the country is generally going to take a befund like the serious and doing politics ?
dk : you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of glücksforschung in politics .
recognition is slowly going to be in the united states , no question , but in the u.k. kingdom , she just happens , and in other countries , she just happens .
and people are , admit that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it will take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to study erlebnis-glück , or whether they &apos;re trying to explore , so we have to get this discussion pretty soon .
how to increase happiness is , very much of how you can think about how to think and whether you think about the erinnernde self or whether you think about the erlebende yourself .
this will affect politics , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you &apos;re going to be able to measure the population of the population .
that &apos;s going to be , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , it &apos;s going to be , or at least the most interesting political political debate for the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny kahneman .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been online-spiele for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to do the world in reality , as it is to save in online-spielen .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including all of them , spend more time with playing greater and tollerer games .
now we spend three billion hours a week with online-spielen .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a whole lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think of how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute for the future is that &apos;s exactly the opposite .
three billion hours per week are not nearly enough to solve the most part of the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase it dramatically dramatically .
i calculate that it took time at 21 billion hours per week .
it may be a little bit of a little bit , so again , again , if we can work like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try , we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours per week to the end of the next decade .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture is quite exactly why i believe that games are so essential to survival survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
and this is a portrait portrait toledano .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play . so he had a camera built on the players .
this is one of the classical terms playing .
if you &apos;re not a player , you might have some of the nuances in this picture .
you &apos;re going to see this sense of urgency , a little bit of urgency , but also very difficult to solve a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re playing , you see some nuances here that are gezogenen eyes , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrow is a surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of what &apos;s called epischen sieges .
oh , you know that . ok . so we have some players here .
a epischer victory is a result , which is so positive that they didn &apos;t know before that was possible .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and if you do it , you &apos;re shocked to actually be able to do that . this is a epischer victory .
this player is just a epischen victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces around the world , if we have to take the barriers in terms of the next century , the face of people who look at all the widrigkeiten on the edge of a epischen .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re looking at this face in real life , if we see hard problems .
i call it as a &quot; in life , &quot; -gesicht , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s me , as i &apos;m in life , i &apos;m doing bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home at berkeley , california , where i was in my thesis , why we were doing better than in the real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not so good as good as in play .
and i don &apos;t just mean less , even though that is .
we &apos;re going to reach more . i mean , well , i mean in the relationship with the motivation , inspired together , inspired together .
if we &apos;re in a spielwelt , i think that a lot of us turn into our best version , at any time , and immediately helps to solve the problem , as long as necessary , it &apos;s going to be after the fehlschlag again .
and in reality , if we get failure , when we run on obstacles , we feel often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or zynisch .
we never have these feelings , when we play games , they &apos;re not in play .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible in play , you can &apos;t just do anything ?
how can we apply these feelings to reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft that the ideal environment offers the collaborative environment .
and i saw some things that i &apos;ve been able to be able to do this possible .
so , first when you get into one of these online-spiele , especially at the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are ready to be willing to give you a weltrettende mission , which is immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfect to your current level , right ?
so you create that .
you never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
but always at the edge of their capabilities , so they have to work , but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around and däumchen . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are tons of employees .
where they &apos;re going , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them , to finish their epic mission .
that &apos;s what we have in real life in real life , that feeling that in a fingerschnipsen tons of employees .
and there &apos;s also this epic story , these inspiring history , why we are and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve heard of &quot; level &quot; and &quot; + 1 &quot; , or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in the real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have a talk to a talk and + a crazy idea , + 20 kooks .
i don &apos;t get in the real life .
so , the problem of kooperations-online-welten like the world &apos;s world is that it &apos;s so satisfying , at any time on the edge of a epischen sieges , that we &apos;d rather spend our time in these spielwelten .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of warcraft-spieler has spent 5,93 million years trying to solve virtual problems .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it may sound übel .
but to see it in the context of 5,93 years ago , our first primatenvorfahren began to go upright .
so the first aufrechte primate .
ok , so if we &apos;re talking about how much time we spend with play , it only makes sense , when you &apos;re in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but it &apos;s also appropriate . because it turns out that we use all of these time to play all the time , actually , changing what we &apos;re going to do as humans .
we develop in collaborative , so much creatures .
this is the truth . i believe that .
look at this interesting statistic , recently , recently , the carnegie mellon university was published , the average young man in a country with great spielkultur spends 10,000 hours in a country with a lot of hours with online-spielen to the 21st year .
so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , 10.080 hours are the exact gesamtzeit that they spend in school , from five to the end of high school -- if you never do .
so we &apos;ve got a full of parallelbildungsweg , on the young people as well , what it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have read the new book from malcolm gladwell , &quot; überflieger . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of the 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of kognitivwissenschaft , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the mühsamen of a particular subject to the mühsamen of year , we &apos;re going to get to master .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what &apos;s most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are meister-spieler .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players doing ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we &apos;ve never had gewesenes human potential .
so many people we have in the world at least one hour per day a day .
these are our meister-spieler . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players that are extraordinarily good at whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
so the spieleindustrie konsolen to save the energy and work on mobilfunknetzen , rather than the breitband-internet , so that players all over the world , especially in india , china , can play brazil online .
you expect one extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have a total billion player .
so i started to think about what it is , what these games are doing .
this is the four things that i found . first of all , dringlichkeits-optimismus .
ok , imagine how extreme selbstmotivierung .
dringlichkeits-optimismus is the desire to do it immediately , a barrier to master , with the belief that we have a private hope of success .
player always believe that a epischer victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to try and be the same .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting investigation that show that we like people , after being played with them , even if they &apos;ve defeated us übel .
the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that someone has spent time with us , that the rules will be eingehalten , that we have the same goal , and to spielende .
so that enables the zusammenspielen to grow by bonds , trust and each other .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
glückselige productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the durchschnitts-word of warcraft-spieler is playing 22 22 hours per week , as a teilzeitjob .
the reason is that if we play , we &apos;re actually happier working on working hard when we relax or not .
we know that , as human being human beings , as human beings , if we do hard , great work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right task .
and ultimately , epic matters .
players love to be part of a awe of gebietender missionen .
here &apos;s a hintergrundinformation , to the right light on the right , and you know , you know , all wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
the second largest wiki of the world , with almost 80.000 einträgen , is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about world of warcraft on the internet than over any other subject in every other wiki of the world .
they create a epic story .
they create an epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superkräfte that lead to a single outcome players are super-mächtige , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as individuals .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward castronova is a volkswissenschaftler .
his work is awesome . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in online-welten .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be less than a massenemigration in virtual worlds and online-spielumgebungen . &quot;
and that &apos;s from an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little überschwänglich .
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can achieve more than in the real life .
they can be able to play stronger social bonds than in real life . they get more feedback and rewards in play than in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s totally logical that players are more time in the virtual world than in the real place .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not optimalsituation .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years of zurückliegt .
there are these ancient two , schafsknöcheln . do you know ?
before these fantastic spielecontrollern , there was schafsknöchel .
and these were sort of the first people who were developed by people .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the werken of the old greek historikers , you might know this story . the story about how , and why games were invented .
according to herodotus , games became more closely , in the kingdom of famine during a famine in a famine .
angeblich had been such a big famine that the king of lydien gave himself a crazy idea .
people suffered . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to herodotus , the würfelspiel and vereinbarten , a national strategy , a day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the würfelspiel , because games are so fascinating and with befriedigender , glückseliger productivity surrounded that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and according to herodotus survive , they survived for so 18 years by eating them for a day and played the next .
the same way , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we &apos;re playing games to get rid of the real world .
we &apos;re playing games to get everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that &apos;s in real life in real life , and we get what we need from play .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
this is the exciting thing .
according to 18 years , the famine was not better . so the king , one last würfelspiel anzusetzen .
and they shared the kingdom in two .
they were playing a würfelspiel , and they were allowed to break a epischen adventure .
they verließen , and they went to search for a new home , they just went back as many people to survive , and they were looking for the rest of the area that they could flourish .
this sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest dna-beweise show that the etrusker that will later have the roman römische , which is the same dna .
and so scientists came up with recently that herodotus &apos;s crazy history is actually true .
and geologists found the evidence of a global abkühlung that took almost 20 years of what the famine could explain .
so this crazy story could vote .
you may have saved their people through play , by 18 years of games , and then they had this eingebung , and then they had this eingebung and so much about the other things that they &apos;ve saved the entire civilization .
so we can also .
we &apos;ve been playing for in 1994 .
this was the first strategiespiel in the world of warcraft-serie . that was 16 years ago .
they played for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i want to argue , we &apos;re ready for our own episches game .
so , they sent half of their civilization looking for a new world , so i &apos;m taking my 21 21 billion spielstunden per week a week .
we should be übereinkommen that half of us spend one hour per day with play , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems in the real world ? &quot; and that &apos;s the question i have devoted my work in the last couple of years to the future .
we &apos;ve got this flag in our office in palo alto , the way we need to understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to introduce the best possible result , and then people make the way to make this idea to reality .
we are putting on siege , and giving people the opportunities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you just briefly three games that i &apos;ve designed to try to get people on their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is in 2007 .
it &apos;s a online-spiel that you have to get through a ölknappheit .
you know , in real time , you know , if you have a lot of oil , if you &apos;re going to be closed , you know , if you can be closed , you know , and you have a lot of oil , you know , if you &apos;re going to be closed , and you have to figure out how to make it real life , if it would be true , and we ask you to bloggen videos or photographs or photographs .
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1.700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied them since over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was an economic experience .
nobody wants to change life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epischen adventure and say , &quot; we &apos;re going to get the oil . &quot;
this is one amazing adventure that you go .
find out how you were going to survive , most of our players in the game .
so , for the next weltrettende , we have a greater , higher target than just ölknappheit .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; superstruct &quot; at the institute for the future .
starting to start the computation of a supercomputers that people have only had 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global aussterbungs- sensibilisierungs-system , &quot; of course .
the call of player , to get up , we &apos;ve made almost like &quot; jerry-bruckheimer &quot; -film .
you know jerry bruckheimer-filme , where it is the &quot; dream-team , &quot; you have the astronauts , the scientists , the ex-sträfling , and only together you can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , everyone is in the dream-team , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , security , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players were playing the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when you google .
and the last game we take up on the third march . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you close the game , you get from the world bank called &quot; social umgestalter , &quot; in 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in sub-saharan africa , and they &apos;re going to learn a social redesign .
we have a comic comic . we have &quot; level &quot; for regionales , wissensvernetzung , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i &apos;d like to invite all of you to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in entwicklungsgebieten , which benefit together their own social businesses to save the world .
i &apos;m going to end up .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens to happen next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope you agree that there agree that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a huge meaning for change .
we have these superkräfte , glückselige productivity , the ability to get close close social nets , dringlichkeits-optimismus , and the desire for epischer meaning .
i really hope that we &apos;re playing great games to survive on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;re going to play with me and play with me .
in the next decade , i &apos;m sure in two things that we can make sure that we can create every vaccine future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the weltverändernden .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something that has noticed a few months ago in writing a article for italian .
i always did write my synonym-wörterbuch , but i was done with the back of the text already , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never been in my life in my life , what the word &quot; disabled &quot; disabled . &quot;
i read to you the post .
&quot; , adjektiv , geschwächt verwahrlost , geschwächt , geschwächt , geschwächt , geschwächt , geschwächt senil , altersschwach , altersschwach , altersschwach , altersschwach , altersschwach , altersschwach , made out of the traffic , erledigt , geborsten , siehe , behold , behold , and behold , as well , so useless and weak .
antonyme : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
i read this list of a friend loud , and i had to laugh with it , but i couldn &apos;t get more weitersprechen , and i couldn &apos;t stop reading , and i could end up with this überfallartigen , and then , after this überfallartigen , verbundenden emotional shock .
of course , this was a ausgefranstes , old synonym-wörterbuch , and i thought that the issue has to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early &apos; 80s when i started with elementary school , and i started to build my self outside of my family outside of my family , also in terms of other kids and the rest of the world around me .
and god is not used to be used at the time .
if i was born in a world , i was born in a world that was someone like me to be a person as a person , who can be positive in any different way , but i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the opportunities and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately respond to the online-ausgabe of 2009 , and you expect me to find a ansprechenderen contribution here .
here &apos;s the aktualisierte version of this eintrags .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
and in particular , in particular , the last two words under &quot; near antonyms &quot; . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people who we describe with this words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we build these values .
our language affects our thinking , and how we see the world and people around us .
a lot of altertümliche societies , including the greeks and the roman , really did believe that aussprache of a fluchs has a big force , because that &apos;s what you can be manifestieren .
so , what do we actually want to do -- one disabled people or a powerful people ?
just to give a human being achtlos as a child , you could be enough , einzuschränken , you know , you know , vorstellungen .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open doors ?
a man who opened doors for me was my pediatrician on the a.i. dupont institute of institute in delaware .
it &apos;s called dr. pizzutillo , a italo-amerikaner , whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t tell properly . so he &apos;s always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. was wearing very bright flies , and it was just for the work with kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital just great -- until my physiotherapie .
i had a very often , infinitely , infinitely often with these big , elastischen , elastischen -- in different colors -- you know , to build my bein-muskeln , and i hated bänder , and i hated them , i hated it . i hated her . i hated her .
and imagine , i &apos;ve even had a fünfjähriges kid with dr. p. , and trying to stop this practice , natürllich without success .
and one day , he looked at me at one of my work -- these experiments were just tiring and gnadenlos -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , aimee , you &apos;re so much , powerful , powerful and young girls , you &apos;re going to get one of these on one day .
and if you create it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
so , of course , it &apos;s just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i &apos;m going to do this thing that i don &apos;t want to do , with the prospect of fünfjährige girls in the second floor , but he actually brought me to see my daily übungs-horror with new eyes . so it became a new and vielversprechendes experience .
and i wonder how much of his vision of me as strong and powerful girls had shaped my self , and i could imagine , as one of nature , powerful , powerful and powerful man .
this is just one example of many , as adults can change the imagination of a child .
but as we have already given zitierten examples of the synonym-wörterbüchern , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to make a space , something that we all want to wish : to allow anyone to see themselves as powerful people .
our language hinkt the societal changes behind that was caused in many cases through a technological change .
and , of course , you know , of course , you know , you can be able to use all of your choices , and you know , of course , you can say , of course , you know , you know , you know , in all of your own own destiny , of course , you can &apos;t be able to talk to the social sites , people have to be giving themselves a identity , in their own way , in their own way to groups in the world , which you pick yourself .
so maybe this technological change really clearly , is that there &apos;s always a different truth , because there &apos;s always another person who can give a little bit and very powerful and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus .
and again , you know , again , you know , it &apos;s an interesting story , because people are going to be able to look at me -- this is an interesting thing for me , and i &apos;m never gepasst , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with the questions of people to answer , and i think slowly , i understand why .
so this sentence depends on the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea that success or happiness depends on the idea of it , as if my life was so successful , because i could drop the possible one of life with a prosthetic to a prosthetic , or whatever people with my disability .
but the truth is that we change . of course , we &apos;re shaped by the challenge , whether you &apos;re physical , emotionally or even both .
and i &apos;ll argue that &apos;s good .
widrigkeiten are not a obstacle that we need to have to do better with our lives .
widrigkeiten are just in our lives .
and i tend to see widrigkeiten as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that it &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s hardly to see , but it &apos;s constantly in me .
and i don &apos;t want to do the effect of the schwere of a human being .
there are widrigkeiten and challenges , and it &apos;s only alllzu , and each person is all about it , but the question is not whether we &apos;re clear with widrigkeiten , or not , but how we get it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for people who we love to maintain schicksalsschlägen , but they prepare to get good at that .
and we don &apos;t have a like our children , if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you &apos;ve got to separate two things : to one of the medical fact , for the medical fact , and to the other social opinion , whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and in order to be honest , the only real disability that i had to put apart with apart is that the world is constantly , you can me describe with these definitions .
in our desire to protect the people who are the heart of us , and to tell them the cool , hard truth about their medical forecast , or even a projection to the quality of life that they &apos;re expecting , we have to take care that we &apos;re not going to figure out that somebody actually is disabled .
maybe this is the current concept , which is only looking at what &apos;s in a broken thing , and how we fix this , for every single human disability , a greater disability .
if we don &apos;t treat a human , not to treat a person , and not all of his forces and possibilities , we &apos;re going to create the natural struggle that you might have to have to have , another disease .
we degradieren a person who has a value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the patologie and focus on all of the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between the perception of our unzulänglichkeiten and our great erfindergeist , a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t be abwerten , or verleugnen , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , even though , we &apos;re going to go to the carpet , but it is about to see the widrigkeiten opportunities .
i might be more likely to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to get through widrigkeiten , but that we &apos;re open for it , you know , you know , to give you a kampf-ausdruck , and maybe even to dance with it .
and maybe we can do it , as a matter of natural , stimmiges and useful , and we don &apos;t feel so much about their presence .
this year , we celebrate 200 200 of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin has written in my eyes , on something very true in the human character .
i would use it : not the most powerful of its way , and not the intelligenteste of its way , but the way that changes best .
from conflicts , creativity creates creativity .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people , to survive and aufzublühen , from the fight of the human mind is to transform itself through conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest abilities of people .
and maybe we know what wood wood we are geschnitzt when we &apos;re really geprüft .
maybe that &apos;s the point of widrigkeiten , a sense of ichs , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see widrigkeiten as change .
widrigkeiten are a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i think the biggest damage that we &apos;ve done ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
so , honestly -- who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical . but not the normal ones , and would you really know these arms , gray person really want to know , if they really were ?
i think more .
it would be great if we &apos;re going to get this paradigm from normalität to another , or the strength , even a little bit more dangerous to say , and we could share the forces of very many kids , and invite them to bring their very special and valuable skills into society .
anthropolgen have found that we &apos;ve always got people from members of our society to be useful , to be useful and to be useful .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals have done 60,000 years ago and people with severe physical physical injuries injuries , and it might have been , because the lebenserfahrung in the überlebenskampf of these people for society .
they didn &apos;t look at these people as a broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and value .
a few years ago , i went to the city that i grew up in the city , in a lebensmittelmarkt in the northeast zone in pennsylvania , and i was standing in front of a scheffel tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had shorts .
and i hear how a guy behind me says , &quot; well , if this is not aimee . &quot;
and i move around and i see these older men . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , we know ? i don &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you may hardly remember me .
when i first saw her , i pulled her out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , so that .
and of course , it did it click click .
this was dr. kean , a man who i only knew from narratives of my mother about this day , because i knew , of course , is a lot of typical to my birthday in two weeks .
the doctor in my mother &apos;s doctor was on holiday , and so my parents had the man who brought me to the world , not at all .
and because i was born without wadenbeine , and my feet had been looking at them , and i only have some toes of toes and a few toes on the other foot , he was the überbringer , he had to be the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never be as flexible as other kids or you could never have an independent life , and they &apos;ve just got me lying . &quot;
now , in fact , if i had a buchstabier-wettbewerb in the second class , whether i was going to take a buchstabier-wettbewerb in the second class , whether i was going to be able to go to the pfadfindern in the second class , whether i had errungen my scholarship or one of my sportlichen , and he used these clips to teach his students , medizin-studenten from the hahnemann medical school and hershey medical school .
and he called this part of his kurses , the x factor , the potential of the human will .
you can &apos;t just point enough , how much that factor of life can be the quality of life .
and dr. kean , he said , &quot; i learned that kids , if you &apos;re not going to be told anything else , and even if you only get a little bit of support , when you get kids , you can do a lot . &quot;
see , dr. kean has changed thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and like somebody deals with it , are two different things .
and also , i think , in the course of time , if you asked me at the age of 15 years , if i had asked my prostheses prostheses of meat and bone , i would have no second gezögert .
i just wanted to work at the time .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s what happens because i experienced something with my legs , and not despite this experience .
and perhaps that change could happen because i &apos;ve been so many people , because i &apos;ve been so many people who have opened the doors , rather than to meet people who were einschränken me or to give me an idea .
you see , it really takes a people to tell you how they can manifestieren their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate its own inner forces -- the human mind is so empfangsbereit -- if you can do that , and for someone in a critical moment , you open up a door , you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
they bring them to open their doors .
the real meaning of the worts , &quot; wurzelt &quot; wurzelt &quot; in the word &quot; educe . &quot;
it means to produce something that is in one , the potential .
again , what potential is we want to say ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the &apos; 60s , in the 1960s , in the &apos; 60s , in the &apos; 60s , in the &apos; 60s , in the &apos; 60s , in the &apos; 60s , in the 1960s , the gymnasien turned into gesamtschulen .
they call this &quot; streaming trials &quot; in the united states as &quot; tracking . &quot;
the students are divided up after notes .
and the one student will become mündlich harder , and they get better teachers .
they &apos;ve got over a dreimonatigen period of students with a &quot; good note . it &apos;s been said to them , they were asse that they were very smart , and after these three months , they really wrote einser .
and of course , it breaks the heart that vice the umgekehrt were told , they &apos;re only enough .
and then it was after the three months .
but only those who were still in school -- besides the students who had geschmissen school .
so , very important with this study , teachers were not eingeweiht .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they simply said that be the einser-schüler , and they are the students with the grade enough , and they &apos;ve been taught them something and treated them .
the only disability is a mind that was broken a mind , has no more hope . he has no more schön. our natural , kindliche neugier. , and our angeborene ability of imagination .
but if we manage to support the human being able to support the human mind , to keep alive , and other people to find beautiful , curious about and phantasievoll , and then we put our forces really positive .
if a mind has these qualities qualities , we can create a new reality and new daseinsformen .
and i &apos;d like to end up with a friend of hafiz im , who &apos;s written by a persian poet called hafiz in the 14th century , but the god &apos;s god , not the god of the verbote , but the god who knows only four words , and it &apos;s constantly repeated all the time , he says , come , come dance with me . &quot;
come to me , dance with me . thank you .
how would they want to be better than they are right now ?
suppose i said that by a few changes of your genes , a better memory could be -- more precise , closer and faster and faster .
or want to be more powerful , stronger power .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
what about to live longer in good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who are always on more creativity .
what would you like most ?
what would you like to have , if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably as many like the creative people are here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would a good for a good memory ?
a few more .
what about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to do that as a doctor .
if you could have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is this all einbildung ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a andauerndes issue on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the mind of a doctor &apos;s mind .
the big geneticists in the 20th century , t.g. dobzhansky , who was also a kommunikant in the russian orthodoxen church , once wrote an article called &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make any sense of evolution in evolution . &quot;
well , if you &apos;re one of those who accept biological evolution , it would be a very good time to accept your personal evolution , and you &apos;re going to take permission -- and maybe you can take permission , and maybe you can take a look at kathryn schultz &apos;s book that &apos;s about wrong , because nothing else is going to do any sense for you .
but if you accept biological evolution , you think about this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it other geltend , or does it matter ?
this is another view on the tree of life .
in this image , i have a bush as a center of verzweigungen in all directions , because if you look at the edge of the tree of life , all of the existing data on the top of these branches have been in evolutionary terms , they &apos;ve survived ; it has to link its environment and demonstriert its environment .
the human part of this busches , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
we zweigen from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period period , maybe 20 or 25 or 25 different spezien of hominids .
some are coming and left .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130.000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re rather remote remote from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually the biggest part , the basic mechanisms are our cells quite equal .
is you clear that we can use it and make the mechanisms of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human being used to be used to be diabetiker ?
this is not like humaninsulin ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically ununterscheidbar from what comes out of the pancreas .
and when we talk about bacteria , you know that each of us in our gut will lead more bacteria than in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , if you think , when antonio asked after your self , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful gastfreundlichen environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s feucht , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give all of nutrients that you could only wish without some effort .
it &apos;s really a lighter way for bacteria , with gelegentlichen unterbrechungen unterbrechungen of unintended , jeodch stoß .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they care for their lives .
they &apos;re helping nutrients . and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionäres balance in a form of a species ?
or are we wired to be something else -- something that might even better be adapted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s take a step back in the front of the big bang , 14 trillion years ago , about 14 trillion years ago -- the world &apos;s first sign , about three billion years ago on earth -- the first mehr-zelligen organisms , perhaps as much 800 or a billion years -- and then the human species , which shapes in the last 130.000 years ago .
in this vast unvollendeten symphony of the universe , life on earth is only just about bemessen ; the animal kingdom , like a single takt , and the human life , a little notenverzierung .
that &apos;s us .
so this is also the unterhaltungswert of this talk , so i hope d ate it to them .
now , when i was a neuling on college , i had my first biologiekurse .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i noticed something very fundamental : in most of the lives of life in einzelligen organisms , sharing every cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to continue in both tochterzellen .
but at the time , as a mehrzelligen organisms showed up , they started changing things .
sexual reproduction enters into the picture .
and very important , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome is going , the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the unausweichlichkeit of the death of our body in evolution is going to enter how the sexual reproduction .
now , i &apos;ve got to say , if i was a college-student , i thought , okay , okay , death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty sensible at the time , but with every year it has come to my increased mind .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , which in las vegas , in las vegas in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on its hotelzimmertür .
he opens the door .
in front of him , a beautiful spärlich showgirl .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super-sex . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization to that as a doctor , as a doctor &apos;s goal , as the goal of evolution -- not necessarily , just different .
i &apos;ve tried to keep the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to repair the health of a disease .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
evolution is all over the copying of the genome on the next generation , adaptation and survival generation for generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they are , and i &apos;ve been developing rockets to send the genetic fracht into the next stage of orbit to the ocean .
i think we would all think we would all the mood , you know , to understand all of them , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to reach immortality through my work .
i want to do it by not to die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily want to be the longest life .
it &apos;s not necessarily the biggest ones , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution priviligiert the creatures that are best to adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
and on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are going to be there , and by doing the hot fish survive , if fish were there , there would be a vacuum of cooking fish , yet they &apos;ve been able to do a bewohnbare environment .
so , what does that mean if we look back on what happens in evolution , and how we think of people in evolution in evolution , and most of all , as we vorausschauen in the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reasons would be that it &apos;s first of medicine , we &apos;ve been able to get a lot of genes to get a lot of genes that were otherwise , and from the population that would be removed from the population .
and secondly , we as a species , we have a species , that we &apos;ve been able to adapt to ourselves in the same way , as we can adapt to them .
and by the way , we walk and we mix and mix and mix , so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary , for evolution , for evolution .
a second possibility is that it &apos;s going to be a evolution of traditional ways , of course , auferlegt of nature .
and the argument , here would be the wheels of evolution slowly , but they &apos;re unerbittlich .
and so isolation , if we cover a species of planets , it will be isolierung and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third opportunity , a verlockende , fascinating and terrifying opportunity .
i call it neo-evolution -- the new development that &apos;s not just of course , but led to us as a individuen. in the decisions we do .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s first look at the reality that people are doing today in some cultures of decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice , to have more men as women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the one and the family choose .
so think if it &apos;s not only possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to make the genetic anpassungen to make the disease and prevent disease .
what if you could make the genetic changes to remove diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or reduce the risk of cancer ?
wouldn &apos;t they want to make these changes in their genes ?
if we are vorausblicken , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2,7 billion dollars .
next year when it was done in 2004 , they were able to do the same for 20 million dollars in drein to four months .
today , you can basenpaare a sequence of three billion base base of the human genome base of the human genome base of the human genome at a price of about dollars and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take a long time , until reality will be that there will be 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everybody .
a week of a week , the national academy of engineering for francis arnold and willem stemmer , two scientists , who developed the natural process of evolution to do the natural process of evolution , to work faster and to wünschenswerte proteins in a more efficient way -- which is called the frances arnold evolution .
so , a few years ago , the lasker-preis was wurde for his research for his research , for his research , for his research , for his research , and through the manipulation of just four genes , the cell cells , induzierte them into a pluripotenten stem cell -- potentially , potentially , to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a cell in your body .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that produces the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only about protection themselves , but also to be able to serve other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study with vaccine with vaccine that has been grown in the cells of a tabakpflanze .
can you imagine a good idea that comes from tabak ?
this is all the reality , and in the future , much more possible .
so just imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if you could change the spermien and eizellen or the fresh befruchtete , could change your children a better chance for a gesünderes -- eliminating the diabetes , controlling the hämophilie , remove the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to healthier ?
and then the analytical technology , the same motor of science can allow the changes to prevent disease , could also give us verabschieden , too , hyper-kapazitäten -- better memory .
why do not have the schlagfertigkeit of ken jennings hben , especially if you can extend it to the next generation of watson-maschine ?
why not have the fast muskelfasern who will allow you to run faster and longer ?
why no longer life ?
these will be unwiderstehlich .
and if we are in a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we &apos;re going to be transformed by alt-stil evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires maybe 100,000 years , and we can block it in a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions with them , or their grandchildren , or their grandchildren .
do we use these decisions to shape a society that is better , which is more friendly ?
or will we choose different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to form a society dielangweiliger and uniformierter , or more robust and vielseitiger ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to be facing .
and most of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom of the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to make these decisions ?
in the good ones in the good , as you might think , these decisions are going to be about us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something , a portable robot , gives you übermenschliche skills , or another , that helps you get to stand up and go back .
we call these robots exoskelette .
they &apos;re not different than something that you put in the morning , and you give them additional strength , and you &apos;re going to keep your speed , and will help you keep your balance .
that &apos;s actually the real verschmelzung of human and machine .
but not only that -- merge with it , and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start to talk about the american soldiers , which is about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the request that they should wear more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- rückenverletzungen , 30 percent of them -- chronic rückenverletzungen .
so we thought we would embrace this challenge and create a exoskelett that would help you deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you now -- or human universal load carrier .
soldier : with the hulc-exoskelett , i can carry 200 pounds of verschiedenartiges terrain terrain , many hours .
his flexible design enables it to be deeply deeply in living deep in space , and höchst .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and raise my strength and resilience .
we &apos;re as far , with our industriepartner of this device , this new exoskelett in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s look at the man &apos;s man , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there is 68 68 million people in the wheelchair in the wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually an conservative estimate .
we &apos;re going to talk a lot about very young people who are in the blütezeit of their lives , in the blütezeit of their life -- &apos; 20s , &apos; &apos; &apos; 30s , &apos; &apos; &apos; 30s , &apos; &apos; 30s , &apos; &apos; 30s , &apos; &apos; 30s , &apos; &apos; 30s , &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; 30s , &apos; the wheelchair , and the wheelchair the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the alternde population , their number of numbers .
and it &apos;s pretty much the only option -- when it comes to a hirnschlag , or other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so it &apos;s been for 500 years , by the way i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chapter in mobility .
so let me introduce you now , well , let me imagine that by amanda , 19 years ago , 19 , 19 years ago , that it has been a rückenmarksverletzung that she couldn &apos;t walk in 19 years and yet .
thank you .
as i said , amanda contributes our elegs .
it has sensors .
its completely non-invasiven sensors in the crutches , the signals zurücksenden on our onboard-computer , which is on your back .
here &apos;s also batteriepackungen , the motorantrieb is on their hips , as well as they move to their kniegelenken , they move forward in this pretty geschmeidigen and very natural .
i was 24 years old and in bestform , as a monströser purzelbaum purzelbaum during a skiabfahrt .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement below my beckens .
not long after that , a doctor in my krankenzimmer , and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s stahl hope from my consciousness .
anpassungsfähige technologies have come to learn to go back again , again , to climb back , and even drive the hands .
but nothing was invented that i would let me go back .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or amanda here , and all amanda here and all of the man , but for everybody .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the head of a nonprofit organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t bekämpfe poverty , i als as a gehilfe of a feuerwehr-hauptmanns at a volunteer löschzug feuer .
now , in our city , in the volunteers , a hochqualifizierte berufsfeuerwehr , you have to be pretty early on the brandstelle to be able to be mitmischen .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer of the brandstelle , so i had a fairly good opportunity in .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach verantwortlichen hauptmann and figure out what our jobs would be .
when i found the hauptmann , he had just been in a serious conversation with the hausbesitzerin that certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of night , and she stood in the schlafanzug , and they were standing under a screen out in the strömenden rain while their house stood in flames .
the other volunteers that was gone out of me -- let &apos;s call him lex luther -- erreichte as first , and was asked to go into the house and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was sprachlos .
there was any lawyer or vermögensverwalter , who could tell people that he could tell in a brennendes to save a living house to save a living creature , just because it was five seconds faster than me .
well , i was the next .
the hauptmann winkte me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go into the house .
you have to go up to the top of the fire , and you have to get this woman a few shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
well , not exactly what i would hope was , but i went to go up -- the flur , along the hallway , &quot; the real &quot; the &quot; real &quot; real &quot; the real &quot; real &quot; real &quot; the real &quot; the real &quot; the real &quot; real &quot; the real &quot; the real &quot; the &quot; real &quot; real &quot; real &quot; real &quot; real &quot; the real &quot; the real &quot; real &quot; .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey down , where i was erzfeind my erzfeind and i met my hund .
we put it out to the hausbesitzerin , where , not surprising , his much more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the feuerwache got a letter to the hausbesitzerin , where they bedankte for the brave einsatz .
and it was a lot of geschätzte kindness of kindness : somebody actually brought a pair of shoes .
and both in my profession as well in my profession , as well as a volunteer hood , i &apos;m a witness of generosity and kindness in the great scale , but i also see the love and the muts of individuals .
and do you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so , if i look at this room in this room , and people see , you know , you know , or on your way of your way there , i want to offer you this : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait for having a difference in the life of another , until you get your first million .
if you have something to be , you &apos;ll give it now .
use them in a suppenküche , räumen a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us an opportunity to save life &apos;s life , but every day , but every day offers us to change one .
so let &apos;s go on ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just come back from a community that knows the secret to the fortbestands of humanity .
a place where the women lead to the zepter , &quot; hello &quot; hello , &quot; and the game is determined the day -- where fun is a serious matter .
and no , it &apos;s not burning or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their blood .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the urwald of congo .
bonobos are together with the chimpanzees our next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years ago .
well chimpanzees are known for their aggressivität .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of überbetont in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos are showing us the other side of the coin .
while chimpanzees from large , fear einflößenden kerlen is led by ermächtigten females .
and they have really come up , because this leads to a very ausgesprochen society in the deadly violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known under the primates .
they &apos;re living in the depths of the kongolesischen , and the observation is very difficult .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the scene of a violent argument that has been gefordert for decades and almost as many lives have helped the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprised that these destruction also survive the survival .
fleischhandel and the decline of the baumbestandes is that you don &apos;t even fill in a stadion stadion -- and you &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a verborgenes laugh that the trees was shattered .
who are these relatives ?
we know it as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have häufigen , auch sex , with wechselnden partners partners , and rules and social angelenheiten .
i don &apos;t say that &apos;s the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because life &apos;s life is from more than the kama .
bonobos -- like people -- love playing their lives .
play is not just kinderspiele .
for us , and it &apos;s essential to the bindung of relationships and the care of the tolerance .
and we &apos;re learning and the rules of the game .
play is increasing creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you look at bonobos at play , you see the evolutionary origins of human lachens , dance and rituals .
play is the kitt that beieinanderhält us .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique photographs straight out of the wild .
first of all , a ballspiel on bonobo-art -- and i don &apos;t think about fussball .
so here we see a young female and males in a verfolgungsspiel .
look at what she does .
that could be the evolutionary origin of this : &quot; you put it on the eggs . &quot;
only that i think it &apos;s rather , it &apos;s not true .
yes !
so sexspiele are common , both in bonobos as well as people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ideenreichtum that you get new elements to the game -- like the hoden -- and also , like the game have to trust both trust as auch -- while it &apos;s in the same time in the same time .
but the game is a formwandler .
play is a formwandler , and it can take a lot of forms that some of them are ruhiger , phantasievoll , curious -- maybe to discover the text again .
and i want to show you , this is fuku , a young female , and she plays peaceful with water .
i think , just as they play it alone , we sometimes play , and we loten boundaries of our inside of our inner worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore and interact , and the unexpected verknüpfungen that we form is , are the real nährboden of creativity .
this is just a little vorgeschmack on insights , the bonobos are giving us to our past and present .
but it also true a secret for our future , a future that we have to adapt to increasing challenges , greater creativity and druch of cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our anpassungsjoker .
to be successful at a unbeständige world , we need to play .
but will we do the best from our spieltrieb ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people equally , they don &apos;t have the lives from the teeth alone .
just if it seems barely appropriate , you know , you know , you know .
and therefore , my primatenkameraden , let &apos;s hug this gift of evolution and play together as we play the creativity of kameradschaft and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in the middle 1979 , at the same same time , at exactly the same moment , every zeugt , a baby -- okay .
so two couples , every zeugt a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to use a lot of time to imagine the zeugung , because if you &apos;re looking at all the time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
just imagine for a moment .
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case , this is a y chomosom , which hits the x chromosome of the eizelle .
and in the other case , it carries a x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the eizelle .
both of them are überlebensfähig , both fire .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
most of my activities , i have two scenarios .
in a hat , i &apos;m on the history of anatomy .
i &apos;m studied historikerin , and in this case , i study the way people with anatomy -- that human body , animal bodies -- like it &apos;s mit , with körperkonzepten , like they &apos;ve thought about body .
the other hat that i &apos;ve carried at my work is the activist , as a patientinnenanwältin -- or , as i say sometimes , as a ungeduldige lawyer -- people who are the patients .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have körpertypen , the social norms .
so , for example , i &apos;ve been working with people who are siamesische twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with zwergenwuchs -- so people who were smaller than common .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with intersexuellen people whose gender their gender -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female körpertypen .
and as general , we can use the word intersexualität .
intersexualität comes in many different forms .
i just give you a few examples of examples for the possible kinds of geschlechtsvarianten that are not the male or female standard .
in a case , maybe someone with a xy chromosomenbasis , and the sry gene gene leaves the protogonaden that we &apos;ve all got to go up to hoden .
and that &apos;s why there are geben testosterone .
but because this individual are missing the receptors to see testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the testosterone .
and that &apos;s called androgenrezeptor-defekt .
so a lot of testosterone , but no response to it .
so , as a consequence of the typical female of the typical female .
when the kid is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it doesn &apos;t take the time until you get puberty and grow your breasts and grow yourself , and you &apos;re not going to get your period , until someone &apos;s going to get something different .
and they make a few tests and find out that they are , rather than eierstöcken , and in fact , in fact , hoden , and they have a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold this person for a male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something called adrenalindrüsen .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the nebennieren places that are virilisierende hormones .
most of the women , as i -- i don &apos;t know to be a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromosomenaufbau , but i think i probably have the typical -- most of the women like i actually talk to androgene .
we produce androgen , and we &apos;re talking to androgene .
and the consequence is that somebody like me actually have a brain that was exposed to , as a woman , as a woman who was born with hoden and a androgenrezeptor-defekt .
so gender is really complicated ; intersexuelle are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , they can be distributed across the whole range .
one example : a few years ago , i received the phone &apos;s call by a 19 man who was born as a boy , he had sex with his girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he just found out that he was eierstöcke and a gebärmutter .
he had an extreme form of an angeborenen nebennierenrindenhyperblasie .
he has xx chromosome , and in the womb , his nebennieren was so much active that they basically made a male hormonumgebung .
and as a consequence of the consequence of his genitalien male , his brain was exposed to the typischeren male part of the hormonenspektrums .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody could do something .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , he actually got enough medical problems , because he figured out that the doctors found that he was in a female female .
okay , just a quick example of a version of intersexualität .
some people with xx chromosomes , develop something called the ovotestis , which is eierstockgewebe by hodengewebe .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
and the reason children with this kind of body -- be zwergenwuchs or siamesische twins , be intersexuell -- surgeons often adapted to the norm , is not because it &apos;s because it &apos;s physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they &apos;re often done different sorts of surgical surgeries is because they &apos;re bedrohen our social categories .
it typically , our system is based on the idea that there &apos;s a certain anatomische feature with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that a woman means to be a female identity , is to be a black person , is meant to say , an african anatomy in terms of their own history .
so we have this awful vereinfachende idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body that actually makes us something very different , that &apos;s confused us in terms of these kategorisierungen .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualismus .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualismus .
now you can imagine how astonishing it is , if kids are born , the two people in a body .
where i had experienced most of the excitement , the südafrikanische caster caster last year , semenya semenya letztes in the leichatlethik world , was asked in berlin .
many journalists called me with the question : &quot; what are you going to tell us if caster is semenya female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s no test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is complicated enough to say that nature is difficult for us to say that nature , between male and female , or zwischen and female and female and female and intersexuell , and we &apos;re tastächlich that line , of course .
so we have a situation where , the further on our science , we have to say that those categories that we were holding for robust anatomische categories , which are very simple zuordnungen made to create permanent identitätskategorien , much more unschärfer than we &apos;ve thought .
and that &apos;s not just in gender .
it &apos;s also in terms of race , which turns out as much more complicated than our terminologie .
we are in all kinds of unbequemen areas .
we &apos;re running into the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to start with the fact that we &apos;re only different from very few nukleotide ?
as we continue to push our science , we &apos;re increasingly moving into a zone of the unbehagens , where we need to recognize the simplistischen categories we have probably had too simple .
we see this in all kinds of human life .
one of the areas that we see in the beipiel , in our culture today , in our united states today , are the battle about the beginning and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about what a body is going to be human beings , so that he &apos;s quite right than the fötale life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- maybe not as high as in medicine -- about the question when someone &apos;s dead .
our ancestors used to have never been struggling to fight when someone was dead .
you &apos;ve got somebody to get a feather under the nose , and when it moved , you didn &apos;t bury it .
if she didn &apos;t move it more , you &apos;re buried .
but today , we are in a situation where we will take people lebenswichtige organs and they want to put them in .
and as a result , we get in the fight with the really difficult question when someone &apos;s dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation that we don &apos;t have anymore categories with the simple categories like earlier .
now , you would suppose that the whole collapse would be someone like me was really happy to do .
i &apos;m politically progressiv , i &apos;m verteidige people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to realize that these categories are really much more comfortable than we thought , makes me .
and it makes me angespannt in terms of überlegungen the democracy .
so to tell you about this anspannung , i &apos;ve got to first take a big fan of the kitchen .
i know they were rassisiten , i know they were sexisten , but they were great .
i think they were so tapfer and strong , and so radical , in what they were doing all the years of ertappe das 1776 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happening with the gründungsvätern .
the fathers were from my view of view of my view , and that &apos;s why .
what she was doing was a anatomisches concept , and they were ersetzten it through another that was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
and as you remember , our fathers refused the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy was in the bottom of a very similar concept of anatomy .
the herrscher of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept based on dna , but they had a concept of geburtsrechts .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power to have this political power , because of the vererbten blutlinie from the grandfather to the son , and so on .
the hospitals wiesen this idea , and they set them through a new anatomisches concept , and this concept said that all human beings were created .
they nivellierten the field , and decided that anatomisch , anatomisch , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they did this for part because they were part of a aufklärerischen system in which two things in common .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , science grew .
if you look at the history of the fathers , that many of you were very interested in science , and you were interested in a concept of a naturalistischen world .
they went away from explanations übernatürlicher ways , and identical things , as a übernatürliches concept of power , which is based on where the transmission is based on a very vagen environment .
they moved to a naturalistischen concept .
and then , for example , for example , for example , talk about nature and the god of nature of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they managed to get us a concept of anatomischen common .
and so they really have a really wonderful movement movement .
they didn &apos;t have that way , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened years ?
so , for example , the idea are more important than the anatomische , the concept of the kitchen , which says that there are , is the concept of the gründungsväter , the concept , which says is that neither is more important than the anatomische , the concept of the gründungsväter , which says that there &apos;s the concept of the gründungsväter , the concept of the kitchen , the concept of the kitchen , which says that there &apos;s no difference in a difference , that we should not have to have to have the right .
and women argumentierten .
next , the successful civil rights movement came , where we were seeing people like sojourner truth , who spach , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the marschierenden rows of the bürgerechtsbewegung who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people in different gemeinsamkeiten , which are posted to both of anatomischen differences , again , successfully .
we see the same at the behindertenrechtsbewegung .
of course , the problem is that , and as we start to look at all the similarities , we need to go to question why we maintain certain trennungen .
now , mind , i &apos;d like to maintain certain trennungen , anatomisch , in our culture .
like , i don &apos;t want to give a fish like a human rights .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that 5-jährige should have the right to give their einverständnis to sex or to get married .
so there &apos;s some anatomische trennungen that make sense for me , and that &apos;s what we think should be .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is , and why we keep them and whether they make sense .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that are in the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both the same day at the same day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of you , maria , three months verfrüht , was born , so she was born by 1980 .
heinrich , on the other hand , is born to geburtstermin , so it &apos;s at the one march 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria was born in three months , they get all kinds of the rights three months before heinrich -- the fairly einvernehmlichen sex , the right to get the right to drink .
henry has to wait for all this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the zeitpunktes of its birth .
we &apos;re finding other merkwürdigkeiten about what their rights are .
heinrich , because you think that he &apos;s male -- although i don &apos;t told you that he &apos;s with xy -- because you think he &apos;s male , it can be moved away , what maria has not been worried about .
maria on the other way , can &apos;t be the same thing in all states , the heinrich in all states in all states , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
heinrich can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman today in a few states .
so we have these dauerhaften anatomischen categories that are difficult and fragwürdig in many ways .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is going to make progress like this in the realm of the anatomy that we have to get a point where we have to admit that a democracy that is based on anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give science to science , but at the same time it feels like that the science is autonomous .
so where do we go ?
it seems to be a kind of pragmatic posture posture attitude : &quot; well , we need to pull out a line , so we pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people get caught in a very strange position .
so for example , texas has decided to marry a man , that you don &apos;t have y chromosome to marry a woman and marry woman means you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people don &apos;t test their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i told you about the androgenrezeptor-defekt .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king gives us a dream , &quot; i have a dream of a solution . &quot;
he says we shouldn &apos;t be to &quot; their skin color , but after the property of their character , &quot; judge them , and they go beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you solve people because of their charaktereigenschaften ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we &apos;re supposed to be able to give people so , because i have to admit that i know that i know a series of golden retriever , that probably are more likely to make more than some people i know .
i want to dazusagen that i &apos;m probably going to know some bright labradorhunde labradorhunde , the fähiger , intelligentere and more intelligent decisions to their sexual relationships than some 40-jährige that i know .
so how do we operationalisieren the question for the characteristics of the character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
and part of me wonder , what if the content of a personality would be something that would be maschinenlesbar in the future -- could be made by an fmri ?
do we really want to go to this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really seems to be really important to think about the idea that the united states is to make thinking about questions about questions of democracy .
in our endeavor for democracy , we &apos;ve done our things really well , and i think we would do it well in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation as it &apos;s in iran , for example , where a man who &apos;s bestraft sexuell to other men , it &apos;s bestraft with death , because he &apos;s ready to put a geschlechtsumwandlung in a place where he may be alive .
in this way , we don &apos;t exist with us .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon i talked about a couple of years ago , who had a few siamesische twins with hergebracht to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i went to him , and he asked him why he made these circuits -- it were up to the riskante surgeries -- his answer to his country , that kids would be treated very bad , and that &apos;s why he had to do it .
and i said , &quot; well , well , you know , &quot; well , &quot; now , you know , you know , you know , , instead of an operation to separate them ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible opportunities to allow people to be , without allowing them to change the state of the state .
so i think we have to be leaders .
well , just to conclude , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibilities as democracy might look like democracy , or looked if we had more involved involved in that .
and i want to say something that is radically radical , and i think that there might be different kinds of insights that are very result of different kinds of these anatomy , when people use a gruppendenken .
since years , because i was interested in intersexualität , i was interested in research research in the field of geschlechterdifferenz .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and act in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from kulturübergreifenden studies is that women , in average -- not every one , but the average -- more tend to -- more tend to -- more complex social relationships and the care of people who are vulnerable in the group , are vulnerable to give a lot of attention .
and that &apos;s why if we think about this , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i did a graduate student , one of my favorite studienbetreuer , who had been interested in my interest in feminism -- i looked as a feminist , so it &apos;s -- a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism &apos;s female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dümmste question i &apos;ve ever heard .
in feminism , feminism is actually breaking stereotypes about gender , so feminism is not female .
but the more i thought about his question to think about this is that there could be some weibliches in feminism .
it &apos;s supposed to be something , the average , as female brains of male different from male brains of men are different from male to hochkomplexe social relationships for hochkomplexe social relationships .
so where the fathers were extrem to figure out how individuals in front of the state was , it &apos;s possible that if we were more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re more a concept of a concept , not just how to protect , but how we can worry about each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go to the future , if we &apos;ve got democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual bodies to think about the individual , and think more about relationships .
so , when we try to make a perfektere connection , we &apos;re trying to think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in there , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and this is : i &apos;m obsessed with outfits .
i love it , for every opportunity to find a different farbenfrohes , to find verrücktes , and to take up in the last time and to cover .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of second hand on flohmärkten and in second-hand-shops .
ooh , thank you .
second-hand-shopping allows me to reduce the impact of my garderobe on the environment , and also on my purse .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars is usually a good purpose ; i see pretty unique ; it makes it go to my very personal schatzsuche .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all of the answers , i feel like i &apos;ve won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i was doing for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does someone do with so many outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven paar paar , and that &apos;s all .
unterhosen for exactly a week , all i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i have gewettet myself that i could wear everything i might have to wear , if i came to palm springs only .
and since you haven &apos;t heard of me , when the woman who &apos;s walking over here at ted -- that i found a few things .
and i want to show you my outfits for this week .
does that sound good ?
as i do that , i &apos;m also going to leave you with some of the lessons i &apos;m going to do , whether you believe it or not , you know , from these abenteuern , not to wear anything new .
let &apos;s start sunday .
i call this the strahlenden tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost be great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacke , including me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i &apos;ve carried in this whole week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible impossible to be bad , if you carry hellrote pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you pull other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation becomes totally überbewertet .
i spent a lot of time of my life trying to try to be trying to be myself , and to fit at the same time .
just be who you are .
if you surrounded yourself with the right people , they don &apos;t just appreciate it , they appreciate it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people say to me , i looked like , &quot; play &quot; play &quot; games , or i remember .
i &apos;d like smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something well , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think you &apos;re not going to look good , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize this for you .
if you believe that you &apos;re a wonderful person the outside and a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone here in this audience .
we should be able to be able to rocken everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : &quot; golden pailleten . &quot;
and finally , saturday : a very , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world something about one , without having to say a word .
and over and over and over and over again , if in this week , when this week , people came to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , that &apos;s not going to fit in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to give it all .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to leave .
and i don &apos;t have to do these things emotional , because the corner is always going to be a different crazy , farbenfrohes , strahlendes , strahlendes , just waiting to me , when i love a little bit of love a little bit of love it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , everybody together .
i &apos;ve got something i want to show you .
think of this as a bildpunkt , as flying bildpunkt .
this is what we call wahrnehmbares design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy in italy , with this picture , but the reason why i &apos;m going to show you this is what i &apos;m going to show you that in the formula , something very interesting in this past decades .
a while ago , if you wanted to win a formula on a race , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now , if you want to get a race , you know , in fact , a few thousand sensors , a few thousand sensors , the information , in real time , the information on the system , and then it process , and then use it , and then use this car to make decisions back and make things back in real time in real time .
you would call this , in ingenieurteams , a echtzeit-kontrollsystem .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that consists of two parts -- a spürenden part of a spürenden part .
what &apos;s interesting today is the echtzeit-kontrollsysteme start in our lives .
our cities have been identified , in the last few years , in the last few years and electronics .
they become computers to computers .
and as a computer computers , they start to react in other ways , and they &apos;re being driven and driven and driven .
when we herrichten cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
by the way , i would say that cities that cities are only two percent of the earth , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s land there are living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energiekonsums -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big deal .
beyond the cities , all of this sense and drive all of these everyday life .
this is from an exhibition , the paola antonelli for moma later , over the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; with me . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to talk to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every atom is out there to two , a sensor and a antreiber .
and that changes the interaction that we have people out of our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when michelangelo formed the moses , it means that he took the moses and he took him up on moses -- in fact , you still can see a little bit of untendrunter , and i said , called &quot; perché non parli ? why don &apos;t you ? &quot;
well , today , our environment begins for the very first time to answer .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment , to perceive our environment .
let &apos;s start with that .
now the first project i &apos;d like to introduce to you is actually one of the first of the first of our labs .
it came in italy four years ago in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually a new kind of neue using the network that has been used to be used around the world -- this is a mobiltelefonnetz -- and blind and blind and aggregierte information from this network that have been collected from the operators to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was the fußball-weltmeisterschaft fußball-weltmeisterschaft .
some of you will remember , it was played to france as italy , and then the end of the zidane , the kopfstoß .
and anyway , italy , at the end .
now , you look at what happened this day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the middle of the kolosseum , the fluß tiber .
in the morning , the game .
you see the timeline up .
early afternoon afternoon , people here , and there , the calls out and move .
the game starts -- silence .
france makes a gate . italy makes a gateway .
halbzeit , people make a short call , go to toilet .
second , second halbzeit .
first verlängerung , second .
zidane , in a moment of kopfstoß .
in italy , yeah .
well , in this night , everybody went to celebrate to celebrate .
they saw the big deal .
the next day , all of the world went to meet the siegerteam and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the picture of the space of the place , where , since the roman time , people to celebrate to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the message at the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today , in a way we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
and so quickly , you can feel another example : this is not about people , but things that we use and consume .
now , today we know everything about where our things come .
this is a map that gives you all the chips that a mac computer is , how they came together .
but we just know little about where things go .
so , in this project , we actually designed some little markers to pursue the waste as he goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that were helped us , something more than a year in seattle , helped the things that they wegwarfen -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that they would even throw away .
and then we have the little chips , the little brands , in the trash , and started to pursue it .
here are the results that we &apos;ve just got .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with this information we realized that there &apos;s a lot of ineffizienzen in the system .
we can do the same things in fact that are doing less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this is a lot of unnützer transporte and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that when we see every day that the cup that we throw out every day that we throw away , it &apos;s not going to go away , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we &apos;ll throw out every day is still there .
and if we show the people , then we can push a change change .
so this is the reason for this project .
so , my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could give you a lot more about this , and the many other wonderful things that you can do with , but i want to talk to the second part of the second part that we are at the beginning , and that &apos;s the betätigung of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in zaragoza , spain .
it started with a question of the bürgermeisters that came to us and said that spain and südeuropa have a beautiful tradition to use in public places in public places as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology with it ?
and one of the ideas that had been at mit in a arbeitskreis was , imagine these tubes , and they &apos;re going to work out , they &apos;re opening up and close .
they &apos;re doing something like a wasservorhang mit of water .
if these bildpunkte fall down , you can write about it , you can write patterns , images , text .
and you can approach to him , and it &apos;s going to open up to make you the way you can see in this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of belloch .
it really gefallen him .
and we got the mission to design a building in the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was from water .
there are no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open up and leave you in .
the roof was covered with water .
and when it &apos;s windig , if you want to reduce it , you can even make the roof down .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture is going to be , like in this case , this case , this case , when you get the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t zerstört the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what happens inside .
and here you see me when i was trying to test the sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what one of the night happened to work as all at night .
but actually it was a greater fun at this night .
all the kids from zaragoza came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to you , but a building that was still silent and holes in the water , you had to jump jump without wet .
and this was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as a designer , we always think about how people use things that we &apos;re designing .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and this is the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with people .
now here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical bildpunkten , the bildpunkten of water and the projections .
and this is what took us to think about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that bildpunkte could really start flying .
imagine you could have little helicopter that fly through the air , and every one of you with a little bildpunkt with wechselndem light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the ones you saw earlier , it &apos;s moved to others , totally in synchron .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexiblen screen or an ad , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or , in three dimensions , but in three dimensions of what changes , the light is , not the position of bildpunkte .
they can play with different ways .
imagine that the screen could just appear in different formaten or sizes , in different auflösungen .
but then it could only be a 3d cloud of bildpunkten , which you can walk up , and you can go through that you can be able to go through that you can look at a lot of directions .
here you see a real flyfire-steuerung , the herabsinkt to form a gleichmäßiges creature .
if you turn on the light , it looks like this . so just as we saw it before .
imagine that every single person is being controlled .
it could have an individual bildpunkt that comes from people , from the movements of people or something .
i want to show you something first of this .
we &apos;ve been working with roberto bolle , one of the best balletttänzer our time -- the étoile at the metropolitan theater theater in new york , and the scala in milan -- we have his movements in 3d to use it as momentum to the flyfire .
here you see roberto dancing .
on the left-hand side , you see the bildpunkte , the different eingefangenen sensations .
it &apos;s a echtzeit-3d-scan and a bewegungsaufnahme .
so that you can relate to the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we have all bildpunkte , you can play with it , and you can play with color and drehbewegung .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impulse for flyfire .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olympics olympics .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is , imagine this is what we &apos;re going back to the people to do something and change the environment -- almost something like we call it , wolkenbewegung how to move a scheunentor , but with a cloud .
imagine that everybody can give a little donation for a bildpunkt .
i think that &apos;s the remarkable one of the things that happened last decades , the last decades , is that we have changed from a physical world a digital world .
it has digitized everything , knowledge , and makes it accessible through the internet .
now , for the first time -- and the campaign obamas has shown that -- we can go from the digital world , from the selbstorganisierenden forces of the networks to the physical world .
that can be , in our case that we can use it to design and create a symbol .
this is something that &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , to ask us the coming challenges -- think about climate change , or the co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world to the physical .
so the idea is that we actually put people in the people in which they do things together , collective .
the cloud is again a cloud of bildpunkten , in the same way as a real cloud a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of bildpunkten .
it &apos;s a physical thing in london , but with bildpunkten covered .
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments for olympia 2012 and also share it as a kind of connection to the community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go to the top of londons new berggipfel .
you can go inside .
and a kind of digital leuchtturm at night -- but as a allerwichtigstes , a new kind of experience for everyone who want to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people are separate from nature , and that everything is connected .
the first time i was about 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first eisberge .
i gave awe .
my heart raste , as i was trying to believe what i was in front of me .
the eisberge around me almost 60 feet from the water , and i could only wonder that this was a snowflake on another snowflake , year , year .
eisberge are born as a kalb of a glacier , or indem from eisschollen .
every iceberg has his own individual personality .
they are interacting with a clear way with their environment and their experiences .
some refuse to give up and klammern klammern to the bitteren , while others don &apos;t get more and more , more dramatic passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think they &apos;re isolated , apart , separate and alone , as we often see people .
but the truth is far away .
so as a cop , i &apos;m schmilzt his vorzeitliche atmosphere .
so during the iceberg , he &apos;s setzt drinking water that feeds a lot of life forms .
i &apos;m going to go to my footage of this eisberge , as if i could make portraits of my ancestors , in mind that they exist in these individual moments of this way .
it &apos;s not a death when it melt ; it &apos;s not an end , but a fortführung of her pfades along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the eisbergen of the ice is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is a cop that i have in kekertsuatsiak in kekertsuatsiak .
it &apos;s very rare to actually see a rollenden iceberg .
here you see it now .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five meters long .
please watch the form of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the wasserlinie .
you can see here , it starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a grönland-eisbergs .
it reaches about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just like this , you &apos;ll show you a different side of your personality .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinary by the work on some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was about this guy .
his name is tempt .
tempt was one of the leading graffitikünstler of the 1980s .
then , one day , he came back , and he said , &quot; paps , my legs . &quot;
and that was an outbreak .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood up to him .
i have a company that makes design and the animations , and so there is inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the art art .
so we decided , tony -- tempt -- and to support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and his brother and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to only talk again with tony .
i just want to go again with him , and i said , &quot; wait for me , is this not -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all all the paralyzed people communicate with these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard to higher gesellschaftsschicht and a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
ordinary people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
does anybody see the movie and taucherglocke ?
so they communicate -- they walk along their fingers .
i &apos;m staunte , &quot; very archaisch , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need , just a check a check , and instead i asked a check that i didn &apos;t have the slightest idea of how i was going to be einlösen .
and i &apos;m offering myself to the place and his father -- with the words , &quot; well , my proposal is : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;ll get a device , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can make his art again .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s going to put all this in , it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i talked a few months later at a conference .
i met these people from grl , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to map any surface on any surface , and then draw with a laserpointer that will recognize only the negative area .
so they go around and make kunstinstallationen like this .
they say that all the things that are up up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the geschlechtsteilen , then the schimpfwörter , then the bush-verleumdungen , and finally , people are doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in her presentation .
and i went home with my wife , and she said , &quot; well , second , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control things , then we should find a way that tempt can control a laser , so that he can do graffiti again , that would be awesome . &quot;
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , a lot of organization and a lot of this , and a lot of things , we &apos;ve reached some things .
one , we have the insurance insurance the doors , and actually have a device for tempt a device that he can communicate -- a stephen hawking-maschine .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him yoda , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so unwürdig , this guy is incredible . &quot;
we also , we have seven programmers all over the world -- literally from all of the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my kids , and i moved to the garage , and this hacker and programmers and verschwörungstheoretiker and anarchisten have taken our house .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful stupid to do that , and we were zurückkämen , and all the images the walls would be graffitis .
but for two weeks , we have programmed , we went to the strandpromenade in venice , my children were involved , my dog , too , and we created this .
it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap sonnenbrille that we bought in the strandpromenade of venice , something kupferdraht and a few things from the baumarkt and the elektronikhandel .
we took a ps3-kamera , you have auseinandergebaut , you have auseinandergebaut , and now we have a device that is free -- you can build it ourselves , we put the code for free , the software can download free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free by limitations .
no insurance can be querstellen .
no hospital .
every gelähmte can actually communicate with his eyes alone or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back into tempts room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and this is his room .
so there &apos;s all of these rummel .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks programmierarbeit , nudelparties and durchgemachten nights , tony drew , for the first time after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life system , and he looks beyond his life system .
we owe his bed so he can see it outside .
we &apos;ve set up a system system against a wall of the hospital .
and he drew again for the first time , in the beisein of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling that was on the parking lot .
we also had to einbrechen in the parking lot in the parking lot , so we felt as part of the sprüher-szene .
at the end , he sent us an email with the following content , &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve drawn something .
i feel that i was moved underwater , and finally , and finally , someone up and raised my head up and raised my head down . &quot;
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
this is something like our kampfschrei .
that &apos;s holding us on the shelf , and let us continue .
and we have to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s an amazing device .
and somebody who has a künstlerisches potential deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re able to figure out how to make it better and stronger .
since this time , we &apos;ve got all sorts of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves it .
it &apos;s all from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong twitterte about us and then , in december , in december , it has been honored to us as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
the coolste is -- and that includes the whole circle -- that this april this april , where geffen moca in the inner city of los angeles will be a show of los los angeles .
and there is probably going to be the hardest of the hardest of the straßenkunstszene , banksy -- banksy , shepard fairey , caws -- all these guys are going to be there .
tempt will be part of the show , which is pretty abgefahren .
so basically , when you see , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then make it possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eyewriter -- it was impossible at some point .
make it possible -- you all .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i never had anything to do with augenerfassungstechnologie , but i just caught up and surrounded with amazing people , so we could put something together on the legs .
and this question should be every one of them , and that &apos;s what every single single day you have to make something that has to be done , if not now , when don &apos;t i ? and if i don &apos;t know who ?
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and probably the most of america &apos;s meist kinderbuchautor .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to get a scientist like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or leather , but nobody has ever chosen farmers .
today , i want to tell you about circles and offenbarungen .
well , one epiphany is usually something that you find because you &apos;ve left it somewhere somewhere .
you go to the block , and it &apos;s it as a revelation .
this is a picture of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard bollingbroke .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you about today .
my circle started at the time in the &apos; 60s at high school in stow , ohio , where i was the klassenschwuchtel .
i was the one who was jede every week in the jungentoilette green and blue until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using me the toilet in the lehrerzimmer .
they did .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had a 85 dollars , and it proposed me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i found it for a work at aids-organisationen .
about three or four years ago , i received a phone call from this teacher &apos;s teacher posten , who said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come together with the man i know that you &apos;ve found it now .
and i should say that i &apos;ve got bauspeicheldrüsenkrebs , and i want you to go . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew that they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , and we took them up , and we took them around them , and we put them on their family .
it was something we knew .
and just as the woman that i wanted to learn as adults , i got to visit , turned me to a box full and became my hands in my hands .
what was happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation of that i was talking about .
the revelation is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved yours .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that the rest of life needs .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is so often mentioned here .
it needs the same -- it takes , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to give us these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion while it &apos;s on 1,000 feet .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine an engine , klack , klack , klack , klack , klack , klack , klack .
this sounds fear .
well , i had a unique place that day ; i was sitting on 1d .
i was the only one who was able to talk to the flugbegleitern .
so i looked at her the same , and they said , &quot; no problem , we have caught a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had schon the machine , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot made the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
he turns down the engines .
imagine a geräuschloses airplane .
and then he said three words -- the emotionslosesten words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; bereitmachen to the aufprall . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the bordpersonal .
i could see it in your eyes , there was schrecken , the life was .
now , i want to tell you three things i learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have these lebensplan , we have these things we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to do a hand , and i didn &apos;t do it , all the fences that i wanted to do was all the experiences i wanted to do and never made .
as i later thought about it , a saying , a saying , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because when the wine is here , and the person is there , i open him .
i never want to move anything in life .
and these urgency , this goal , my life really changed .
the second thing that i learned this day -- and that was , when we got the george washington bridge , so much about haaresbreite -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really bereue .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i want to be better in everything i &apos;m anpackte .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve given the ego of my ego .
and i &apos;m bedauerte the time that i wasted for bedeutungslose things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to people .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to verbannen negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i don &apos;t have two years more with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have more right ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing that i learned -- that &apos;s when the inner clock beginnnt , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 .
you see the water .
i said , &quot; please flieg in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts , as you know it from a documentary .
while we were abstürzen , i had this feeling , human , not terrifying .
almost as though we prepare for our lives for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness formierte really is in one thought , which is that i just wish one thing .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
about a month after that , i visited a performance of my daughter -- erstklässler , not much more künstlerisches talent ...
... not yet .
and i feiere , i love like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made sense for me .
i realized at the time when i understood the dots that it was just about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal in life to be a good father .
i was not going to die of the miracle on this day .
i got another gift , which is to see the future , and come back and come back and live differently .
my call to everyone today , is : imagine , the same thing happens on your flight -- don &apos;t you -- but do you think about it , and how would you change ?
what would they do that they &apos;re doing , because they think they were forever ?
how would they change their relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents that you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stuxnet computer-wurm is quite simple .
we don &apos;t want to make iran the bomb .
the most important posten there for the development of nuclear weapons is in natanz .
the gray boxes that you see here , these are echtzeit-kontrollsysteme .
now , if we manage to kompromittieren the systems that control systems , which control the drehzahlen and , then we can actually do a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with windows-software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we do it , there &apos;s an effective windows-virus on a laptop , which is used by a wartungsingenieur wartungsingenieur , to konfigurieren this gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and this is the planning behind stuxnet .
so we start with a windows-dropper .
the nutzdaten are transferiert into the gray box , beschädigen the centrifuge , and the iranian kernenergie-programm verzögert verzögert -- ausgeführt .
this is a piece of cake , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we began to stuxnet our research in six months ago , completely unknown , which was the meaning and purpose of this konstrukts .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated , which is the windows- part , the dropper- part , and he made it from thousands of zero- day- .
and it seemed to be a little vorzuhaben with these gray boxes , these echtzeit- kontrollsystemen .
the erregte of our attention , and we started a labor- project where we infected our environment with stuxnet , and we studied this building .
and then something happened .
stuxnet was like a laborratte that didn &apos;t like our cheese -- schnüffelte it , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
it didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we had with different kinds of cheese , i went to realize that this is a gezielter attack .
totally on a particular goal .
the dropper streift aktiv in the gray box , when a special configuration was discovered , even if the special program that it was trying to get to get on this goal .
and if you don &apos;t , you can &apos;t do anything .
so , this really got my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could be , for example , we say , a us- american power station , or a chemieanlage in germany .
so we should better find out what the goal is .
so , extrahierten , and we dekompilierten the angriffs- code , and found that he &apos;s in two digital points -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also realized that they were very professional designed , from people who had obviously all insider- information .
they knew all bits and bytes that they had to attack .
they even knew the schuhgröße of the maschinenbedieners .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already noticed that the dropper of stuxnet is complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the nutzdaten are a science .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
this is a clip from this angriffs- code code .
we &apos;re talking about 15,000 lines of code .
looks pretty much like altmodische .
and i want to tell you how we were able to get out of this code .
so what we thought were looking first was systemfunktions- aufrufe , because we know what they do .
and then we were looking for timern and datenstrukturen , and they were trying to connect with the real world -- potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these targets that we could say or prove .
so to make these theories theories , we call ourselves that it &apos;s definitely about hochgradige sabotage , it has to be a hochwertiges goal , and very likely to be in iran , because most infections are reported .
well , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
it &apos;s basically running out of the buschehr nuclear power and urananreicherungsanlage in natanz .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all the experts for zentrifugen and power plants from our kundenstamm . &quot;
and i called them up and zapfte their knowledge to compare their expertise to what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring to the little digital sprengkopf with the rotorsteuerung .
the rotor is this is the moving in the centrifuge , that black object that you see .
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotors , you &apos;re actually able to try to break up in the position , and eventually even to leave the centrifuge .
what we &apos;ve found out is that the goal of the attack was actually the goal of the attack and unheimlich -- obviously , obviously , in the attempt to try to let to leave , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to be able to make it quickly .
the great digital sprengkopf -- we got a glimpse by looking at exactly exactly the data and datenstrukturen .
so , for example , the number 164 is going to go out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
and i began to durchzuarbeiten scientific literature , like this zentrifugen in natanz , and found out that they &apos;re strukturiert in so-called kaskaden , and every kaskade contains 164 zentrifugen .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it became better .
these zentrifugen in iran are divided into 15 so-called levels .
and guess what we found in the angriffscode ?
an almost identical structure .
so again , that fit really well .
and this gave us great confidence for that that we studied here .
well , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go .
these results were done through several weeks of hard work .
and we often ran it into a sackgasse , and we had to collect ourselves .
anyway , what we found is that both digital look at actually , and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little sprengkopf takes a kaskade , and überdreht , and überdreht and slow down and down , and the great sprengkopf and the big sprengkopf starts with six kaskaden and manipulated .
so , in the large , and we &apos;re very hopeful that we actually determines what the goal is .
it &apos;s natanz , and it &apos;s just natanz .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be made by stuxnet .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- really gehauen me out of the mind .
down there is the gray box down there , you see the zentrifugen .
now , what this thing is done is that it makes the eingehenden values of sensors -- so for example , by drucksensoren and vibrationssensoren -- and it turns out legitimen , which is still during the attack , working with wrong data .
and in fact , this false set of data is taken from stuxnet before .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywoodfilmen , where the überwachungskamera die the überwachungskamera with vorher mit .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
now , the idea of this is obviously not just that überlisten in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
the idea is to überlisten a digital sicherheitssystem .
we need digital sicherheitssysteme there , where a human maschinenbediener can &apos;t react very quickly .
so in a power plant , for example , when the great dampfturbine is going to be too fast , you have to open up entlastungsventile within milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human maschinenführer .
so at this point we need digital sicherheitssysteme .
and if you &apos;re at risk , bad things can happen .
the power plant can explode .
and not the maschinenführer , even the sicherheitssystem will notice .
this is scary .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this attack is generisch .
he has nothing to do with zentrifugen , with urananreicherung .
so , for example , he would work as well -- in a power station or in a automobilfabrik .
it &apos;s generisch .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to put the nutzdaten on a usb- stick , as we saw it at stuxnet .
you could also use ordinary wurm- technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you eventually get a cyber- massenvernichtungswaffe .
this is the consequence that we have to ask .
so unfortunately , the largest number of goals are not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all of these green areas , these are the zielreichsten environments .
we have to ask the consequences , and we &apos;re going to make better prepare .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it became very much reported that people assume that the mossad is the hauptorganisation behind it .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
in my opinion , i think of mossad , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the cyber- superpower superpower .
there &apos;s only one , and these are the united states -- happiness , for happiness .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for having a heidenangst eingejagt . thank you ralph .
i spent the last couple of years trying to put me in situations that usually are very difficult , and at the same time .
i went to jail -- difficult .
i worked in a kohlebergwerk -- dangerous .
i filmed in kriegsgebieten -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days trying to eat nothing like this -- fun at the beginning , a little hard in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
actually , i &apos;ve been exposed to the biggest part of my career that seems to be fürchterlichen situations , and all of these things to try to look at social , and it &apos;s interesting , and interesting , and hopefully in a way , what they do for the audience of fun and accessible .
so when i knew that i &apos;d come here to look at a tedtalk the world of branding and sponsoring , i knew i would make something a little different .
some of you may have heard of it from a few weeks ago that i took an ad on ebay .
i sent up a couple of facebook-nachrichten , some twitter-nachrichten , and i gave people the opportunity to erstehen on my tedtalk 2011 .
and in fact , i &apos;m going to get the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let this before -- to buy the namensrechte at the talk , which you just see , at the point at the point , not a title had a lot of content and not many evidence of what the subject was going to be .
so what you got was : your name here : my ted tedtalk , who you don &apos;t know what that is going to be the subject , and the end of you in the end of the ears to go to the ears , especially when i give your company for your involvement .
but apart , it &apos;s a very good opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
this is just the arbeitstitel .
so despite this warning , i knew anybody would buy the namensrechte .
so if you asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this with confidence .
but in the new project that i &apos;m working on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the ad .
as i said , i &apos;ve gone out of some pretty horrible situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could be done to me on anything so difficult and as dangerous as these guys are in a room .
you know , i had the idea of a movie .
what i want to do is a film about product placement , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by product placement , marketing and advertising .
and the film will be &quot; the greatest movie ever ever . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the greatest movie ever , &quot; is that everything , from up to the top , is that everything , from the beginning to the end , is that all of the way down to the end , which you &apos;re going to see in the movie , this is the brand .
now this brand , the qualcomm stadion , the staples center ...
these people are going to be connected to the movie -- forever .
and so the movie is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in kansas , forever ?
i &apos;m a redundante person .
that was more to accent .
it was &quot; in uncles , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to have the brand x than titelsponsor , but we &apos;ll make sure that we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the movie .
we may sell a shoe , and he &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever carried ...
the greatest car that you &apos;ve ever got out of &quot; the greatest movie ever ever , &quot; the greatest drink that you &apos;ve ever had a attention of &quot; the greatest movie ever . &quot;
so , the idea is , besides showing that brands are part of life , actually to get them to get the movie ?
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of statten .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would love to look forward if ceg would help to make this happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how empfänglich people will be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use perspective , because this has an negative konnotation -- but you know how this is going to evolve ?
how much money is required to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet , but i think it &apos;s been worth worth some really , some really known brands .
who knows when the film comes out , we might look like a whole horde .
what do you think is going to be the answer ?
the answer is most likely to be &quot; no &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing about the movie , or a difficult thing for me ?
jk : both .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about the brands .
yes .
if you look at the people that you have to do with ...
there are some places that we can apply .
imagine the camera .
and i thought , &quot; imagine the camera &quot; would mean that we wanted to take a hintergrundgespräch .
it turns out it was actually meant , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do anything with your film . &quot;
and just so , all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
no one wanted to do something with the movie .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising , is your product as many people as possible to present it as many people as possible .
especially in the world today , at this intersection of new and old media media media and the media media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea to be in this new exciting process that the masses brings this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a fatalen mistake , and that was the one .
actually no , that was not the mistake at all .
that wouldn &apos;t be a problem at all .
that was okay .
but what &apos;s this picture is a problem .
look , if you &apos;re transparency transparency with transparency , this -- this is one of the first images that seems .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free from deception and tücke , just to discover and durchschauen , by sichtbarkeit , by sichtbarkeit and access to information , especially , in terms of geschäftspraktiken -- the last line is certainly the largest problem .
you know , we &apos;re currently hearing a whole lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes to that , it &apos;s supposed to be done , changes anything .
but why ? well , transparency is fear of einflößend -- like this strange bear , who still brüllt .
it &apos;s unvorhersagbar -- like this strange landstraße .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is risky ?
a whole dish cool whip food .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you know , when i was a kid and my father , when i was lying , and my father , and he &apos;s looking at me -- he would say , &quot; my son , there are three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there &apos;s just a company that was ready to help us -- and it &apos;s only because i know john bond and richard kirshenbaum since years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to deal with the mittelsmann and with my team to the companies .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , is a broad problem .
i have friends , the big , giant hollywood-filme , and i have friends , the little independent-filme like me .
and my friends , the big , giant hollywood-filme , say that the reason why their movies so successful is so successful , they have that .
and then my friends , who make little independent-filme , &quot; well , how do we compete with these big , giant hollywood-filmen ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever . &quot;
so how exactly are we going to see ban in the movie ?
always , when i do the way , and whenever i open up the medizinschrank , you &apos;ll see ban deodorant .
and every time i interviewe somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you like that ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you down to calm .
so , you might be a little bit of interview a little bit of this . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great düfte .
it &apos;s either floral , &quot; or a &quot; paradise , &quot; you &apos;ll have choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped for men as well as well for women , roll-on , or a stick , whatever .
this is the kurzfassung .
now , i can answer all of your questions and give you a ausfühliche version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand as a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so to make things like this -- you know , reminded of people remember -- that &apos;s kind of what we &apos;re interested in .
what would you say to a ban ?
ban is blank .
this is a great question .
überlegene technology .
technology is not the way that you should describe something that is going to do .
we talk about kühn , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes a positive positive , versus &quot; fighting smell smell and moisture . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three times .
these things have a positivere effect .
and this is a millionen-konzern .
what about me ? what about the druchschittstypen ?
i have to talk to the man on the street that are like me , otto-normal-verbraucher .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like beautiful clothes .
&apos; 80s : &apos; 80s , trifft , except at waschtag .
well , what is the brand gerry ?
unique .
i think the genre , the style , that i have , is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of grautöne and so stuff .
but i usually have a accessoire , like sonnenbrillen , or a jewelry and this stuff .
if dan would be a brand , he probably would be a klassisches classic .
mann 2 : the brand i am , i would say , lässige fly fly .
, partly , partly , partly , partly , partly brooklyn-mädchen -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the schmusetyp .
i sell schmusetiere around the country around the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , verzerrten industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex because i was ausliefere .
mann 5 schreiberling schreiberling alkoholsüchtiger alkoholsüchtiger .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a anwaltsmarke .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the tom-marke , but i often look at the intersection of dark glamour and lässiger fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could go into my head , somebody who really could help me understand what was called &quot; markenpersönlichkeit . &quot;
and so , i found a company called olson zaltman .
they have companies like nestle , febreze , hallmark , helped to discover these markenpersönlichkeit .
if they could do it , they could also help me .
you brought up your pictures , yes ?
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit like this with her thoughts and feelings about it .
these are the people that shapes my worldview .
tell me about this world .
md : this world ? i think the world is the world where you live -- like people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live life , the work and like this .
all these things come from a place , and start from a place to me , and to me and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what kind of context is about the thoughts and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about why &quot; why &quot; -phase -- what makes us ?
what is the machete ? what puppenstadium are you right now ?
why is it important , neuzustarten ? what is the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about them , they &apos;re not .
what else did they go through ?
-- it doesn &apos;t have to be frightened . what kind of the world are you ?
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to make itself .
there was pretty much a lot of crazy .
the first thing i saw was this idea that its markenpersönlichekti two separate two separate , but ergänzende -- the morgan spurlock-marke spurlock-marke is a achtsame brand .
they &apos;re doing very well .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction .
and i think some companies will just focus on a strength , instead of both .
many companies tend to be -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- that they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re going to avoid fear , these elements , and they &apos;re going to open them , and they turn them into something positive , and that &apos;s a geschickter schachzug .
what other brands are doing ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can also see it here , target , wii , mini , mini , jetblue .
well , there are verspielte brands and achtsame brands , these things that come and go , but a verspielte , achtsame brand is a pretty strong thing .
a achtsame , verspielte brand . how is your brand ?
if anybody asked them to describe their markenidentität , their markenpersönlichkeit , how would it be ?
you &apos;re a up-attribut ? are you something that comes blood in wallungen ?
or are you more like a down-attribut ?
are you something that &apos;s a little quiet , reservierter , more conservative ?
up-attribute are things that are playful , frisch , wie , abenteuerlich , abenteuerlich , ausgefallen , ausgefallen and lieblich like erol flynn , agile and agile , profan , magic and mystisch like gandalf .
or are they more like a down-attribut ?
are they achtsam and mondän like 007 ?
is it established , traditionally , pflegend , beschützend , compassionate , like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , familiär , sicher , geborgen , bedacht , bedacht and weise like the dalai lama ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies , up up and down-firmen and the &quot; no &quot; said , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this film because they didn &apos;t control control , no control the finished the finished product .
but it &apos;s going to be 17 markenpartner who were willing to make a business with someone who wanted to do business with someone who wanted to do business with someone who wanted to do business with someone who was going to do business with someone who would usually not support them .
they befähigten us to tell the story about the neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this film that you &apos;re using these days now , in order to make the lustzentren of the brain , and in order to make movies as well .
we went to sao paulo where außenwerbung has been banned .
in the entire city for five years , no anzeigentafel , no posters , no poster , no flyer , nothing .
and we went to school , where companies are able to send their way into the verarmte schools , in america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of feedback , or where i had the biggest success , those are where i interagierte with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
because they umgingen the mittelsmann , they umgingen the agencies , and they said that the agencies may not really have their interest in the sense .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artists directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that makes people think that our world challenges .
and what was this ? what was it successful ?
well , since the film was the sundance film festival , we can look at this .
according to burrelles , it was the first in january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- 900 million aufrufe of this film .
it &apos;s actually just a period of two weeks .
this is just online -- not press , no television .
the movie hasn &apos;t yet yet .
there &apos;s not even online . no streaming .
he &apos;s not coming out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has got a very big impact .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every werbeagentur that we talked to her clients , empfohlen the fingers of it .
something that i think is that if you &apos;re in your opportunity , you , you take risks that in those risks in these risks .
i think if you prevent people from it , you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you train your employees to avoid risk , you all prepared to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of possibilities that they might be verängstigen .
finally , when we go forward , we should be the fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome the fear . they welcome the risk .
each one of the löffel , you know , we &apos;ll welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , a little bit of honesty brings us a little bit .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; you &apos;ll welcome transparency , &quot; i was telling you about my good friends of emc , the $ $ for the namensrechte on ebay .
big data is transformed for organizations around the world in great opportunities .
emc : &quot; you welcome transparency . &quot;
thank you .
well , morgan , in the name of transparency : what &apos;s happening right now with $ $ ?
this is a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , ausgestellt on the oberorganisation of the ted-organisation , the sapling-stiftung -- a check of $ 7100 to fund my ted-auftritt in the next year .
my name is amit .
18 months ago , i took something else at google , and i regte to do something with museums museums and art , my chefin , which is today , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of spaßiger trials and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the show .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very easy with this slide and her access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great training of respect -- i &apos;m not -- but i had no access to many museums and this art .
then when i went to visit these museums museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried this desire to make science technology -- to do technology -- using technology with technology .
we then started a team , a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and you tell them some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you &apos;re just going to googleartproject.com. .
you can look around in all these museums .
there &apos;s this uffizi , moma , the moma , the hermitage , the van gogh .
i actually come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
click , and wumms , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make a difference .
you go around and you &apos;re passionate .
you want to be in the museum ?
open the map , jump you up with a click .
in there are , they want to the end of the gangs .
just further . much fun .
explore .
thank you , but the best one is coming .
so , i am in front of my lieblingsbilder , erntearbeiter von in the met .
i see this pluszeichen .
if the museum gave us the image , click on it .
this is one of the pictures .
this is all the metadaten .
those of you who are really interested in art , can click here -- but i &apos;ll click this now .
this is one of the images that we put on with the so-called gigapixel-technologie .
this image , for example , has about 10 billion bildpunkte , i believe .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
this is what i &apos;m going to show you .
you can get very easily and rauszoomen .
you see something fun here .
i love that this guy ; his expression is .
but then you really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there was something happening there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close to the board , and i realized that these kids actually beat something .
i was doing a little bit , i talked about a lot of known at the met at the met , and actually found out that it &apos;s a game called squail , where a gans was beaten on with a stick .
it seems quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned something about it .
to really get close , you can go to the rissen .
just to give you the überblick , i out so you see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best one is coming -- in a second .
let &apos;s go to moma , again in new york .
another lieblingsbild of me , sternennacht .
in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the pinselstriche ?
and what if you want to look at how van of this masterpiece has created ?
you put it in . you can actually go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom into one of my lieblingsteile of this picture , until i really am .
this is sternennacht , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are still many other , but i &apos;m missing the time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
all of you , everyone -- whether rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go out and create your own museum online -- from all these images , you can make your own collection .
very simple , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of zoom -- you can umherzoomen .
this is the gesandten , in the nationalgallerie .
you can put it all with comments , send your friends , and you &apos;re going to start a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , is the main main thing for me is that all the wonderful things don &apos;t come from google .
they don &apos;t think of my museums .
i might not say that .
they come from the artists .
and this was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to be just with this digital medium of art , and they represent it online online .
and the biggest question that i &apos;ve been asked is , &quot; did you do this to replicate the experience of a museumsbesuchs ? &quot;
and the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided in two camps .
that &apos;s the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , the intuitive side is .
if we had a scale to measure the aptitute of every hemisphere , we could represent your brain .
for example , it would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you positionieren your brain on this scale ?
and some of us may have decided for one of those extremes , but i think that most people in the audience in the audience , your brain , your brain , your brain looks like this -- with a lot of aptitute , the same time in both of them .
it &apos;s not like they are both exclusive or something like that .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i look at one of the people , in common with most other other experimental systems that need a good percentage of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good percentage to actually do the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love playing with things .
so we go out and play with it , and then look like it , and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitionen that you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing at the same time can be only in a place .
i mean , it can be strange to think that one thing is at the same time in two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they evolved .
i remember playing a kid playing on a bodenschwelle .
he was another one , and not very good at it and he fell down .
but i bet that it was a very precious lesson with the bodenschwelle of a very valuable lesson , which is the big things that don &apos;t leave you with , and you &apos;re going to stay on .
and this is a great konzeptionelles model of the world , so long they &apos;re not teilchenphysiker .
it would be a terrible model for teilchenphysiker , because they don &apos;t play with bodenschwellen , but with these little strange particles .
and if you play with your particles , you &apos;ve all found all sorts of weird things -- how you fly directly through walls , or you can be at the same time in two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you took quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny particles .
but it didn &apos;t take them to describe the large objects around us .
it doesn &apos;t enjoy my intuition , and perhaps because i don &apos;t often play with particles .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side doesn &apos;t enjoy it .
because if all things are made out of particles , and all these particles are the rules of quantum mechanics , then not to just follow all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that should not be that way .
so i would do better with the whole thing , if we could kind of show that alltagsgegenstände could also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i did a few years ago to do this .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in the quantenmechanischen superposition .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
this is where i zoom up here . we &apos;re looking right here in the center .
and here &apos;s a really big piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal , it &apos;s sort of shaped , and it &apos;s over the edge .
so i made this thing in a similar way to make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new siliziumscheiben , and rackerte for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this one kind of like a swimming pool hole and the thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the quantenmechanischen superposition , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it &apos;s to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but i &apos;m going to get other people to do all these things , because i don &apos;t want them to bother it , or , frankly , they were verschrecke .
so quantum mechanics says that unbewegliche objects are the same .
the mitfahrer for unbewegliche objects are not only people , but the light that seems to be , and the wind that goes on to them and the heat of space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal behave , we had to get out of the whole mitreisenden .
and we did that .
we turned the light off , put it into a vacuum and saugten the whole air and kühlten it up until right now , in the elevator , it was the piece of metal the metal of metal metal , as it wanted to behave .
so we measured its movement .
we found that it &apos;s really strange .
and rather than that , instead of that there &apos;s just quiet , it &apos;s vibrierte . the way it was like this -- like a ausdehnender and together ziehender blasebalg .
in which we gave him a little push , we were able to vibrieren it at the same time and not vibrieren -- something just in quantum quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you is really fantastic .
what does it mean for an object at the same time and nicht ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion of atoms out of the metal are still there , and at the same time , the same atoms are moving up and down .
only to precise zeitpunkten voices .
the rest of the time are delokalisiert .
that means that every atom is at the same time in two different places , which means that the whole piece of metal is two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth me for all this year in the clean space , because , check that , the massstabsunterschied between one atom , and this piece of metal , is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be in the same time at two different places , that piece of metal can be two different places , why don &apos;t you ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical hand says .
so , imagine you &apos;d be at the same time in multiple places , how would that feel ?
how would your mind handle that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we aufwärmten it , the light anschalteten and the box reinschauten , we saw that the piece of metal there in a piece there .
and so , i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator actually quanten objects , which are in a small room together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more of it , it goes deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and this is the tiefsinnige and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should think about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about where they live and work , you &apos;ve been able to choose to choose between at least one hand full of different cities that are all in competition around new residents .
at the moment we are far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in the developing world that don &apos;t even have a single city to be in the developing .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs them to build .
so we could get the world very easily with duzenden , perhaps hundreds of new cities .
this may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
and they just share the building of apartments against the cities .
imagine half of the people who are living in homes , did this already ; the other half is not yet .
you could try to extend the capacity of existing food .
but you know what they were going to be going on in there , in these apartments , and their environment are to avoid the laws and get out of the ausbau .
so it turns out to be a very hard out of all of these neurons .
but you could go to a completely new place , making a whole new program , assuming the laws would support to support that and not behindern .
so , i suggested that governments create new surfaces that provide enough space for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
i found out later , something about the same time , javier and octavio about the challenge of reform .
they knew that every year , you know , in the united states , in the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country , and they can do the same thing .
now , in fact , if we put a message on the area of our country , a part of the american message , and when people are going to work under the kanadischen of the american message , and when people are going to work under the kanadischen rules , and when people want to work under the canadian rules , you know , you can work there , and you can be able to work on the surface of these messages , what they usually need to go to canada or america ? &quot;
in summer in the summer of 2009 in the summer of 2009 .
in the next planmäßigen elections , pepe lobo lobo in a shift whose program has both fundamentally promised .
he asked octavio to become stabschef .
in the meantime , i prepared myself at tedglobal .
by improvement , try and try and try and try and use by consumers , i tried to try to reduce this complicated concept of charter city of the charter elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you &apos;re not allowed to stören existing wohnungsbesitzer .
we pay attention to new technologies , but for progress , it requires technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that hold us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
and again , he showed him .
they called me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s go to the head of our country . &quot;
so we &apos;ve met in december in the sitzungssaal of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve been trying to make sure how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they are .
and i used this chart to show you how valuable rohland is in a place like new york , think that &apos;s a surface in some cases in some cases per worth thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion where there was a break when there was a break , octavio said , &quot; paul , maybe we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk put in very simple form is that a charter city is a place where the beginning of the unbewohntes land is a gründungsvertrag , which is the laws of the laws and the people have the opportunity to decide , either of these rules or not .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president , who said that we need to make this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way that it &apos;s going to happen to our land .
i was asked to go to tegucigalpa , and again , on the fourth and fifth january .
so , i &apos;ve given another with facts , which has a graph like this has been trying to prove that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it needs to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city denver , and the sketch represents the new airport that was built in denver .
by the airport alone , it has a surface of 100 quadratkilometern .
so i &apos;ve been trying to convince the honduraner , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 quadratkilometern .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand thousand morning .
polite have all the applaudiert .
the audience &apos;s faces were very seriously and attention .
the director of congress came on the stage , and he said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we can look at the tedtalk .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and you played the tedtalk .
and i came to the punch line that a new city offers people to new possibilities .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also includes new opportunities for leaders .
the leaders of the government &apos;s government would depend on the help of partnerländern , they could benefit from their partnerländern , they could benefit from the laws for these charter , and to support that everyone can trust that the charter is really going to catch .
and the insight of president lobo was that the security of the durchsetzung i thought about as a way to get a foreign investors and to build this city that city , for all the parties , for all the parties for many years and mistrust .
we went into an area .
this picture is from this place .
it fasst a thousand square miles .
and shortly after january , on january , the 19th january of january , you have a change for a change of the constitution to have a verfassungsgemäße control that is for special entwicklungsgebiete .
in a country that &apos;s just a heftige crisis of crisis , congress was elected for these verfassungsänderung to a voice .
all the parties , all the fraktionen of the society , supported this .
but to become part of the constitution constitution , it has to be genehmigt twice through congress .
on the 17th day on the day , it was genehmigt to a voice .
immediately after this choice , between the 21st and 24 february , a support of about 30 hunduranern traveled to the two places in the world that were most interested in the business of städtebaus .
the one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new stadtzentrum , which is built in south korea in south korea than the stadtzentrum bostons .
all you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the genehmigungen .
the other place that was very interested in the cover , is singapore .
there are already two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re thinking about this , it &apos;s where we are today .
you already have a baugrundstück , and you &apos;re looking at this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already worked on a legal system that allows you to participate , and it &apos;s also working on a external legal system .
a country has already offered to put its supreme court , as a dish for the entgültige appeal of the systems system .
städtedesigner and -bauer are very interested .
they actually get funding .
one thing , as you already know , became already understood , there &apos;s a lot of mieter .
there &apos;s a lot of businesses that like to do in america , especially in a place with a freihandelszone , and there &apos;s a lot of people who would like to live there .
around the world there are 700 million people who say that they &apos;d like to live to live in a different place .
a million people rely on latin america every year and travel in the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to go to their families , sometimes it &apos;s single mothers who have to make enough money to eat and afford clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes children who try to find their parents trying to find their parents , in some cases , haven &apos;t seen any more since a decade .
so what is it for an idea about to think about a whole new city ?
or even duzende of these cities , or are hundreds spread around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to insist on that every family has a choice of a choice between several cities that are in competition in competition ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends from honduras asked me asked me to say , thanks to ted .
do you know how many choices you do in a typical day ?
do you know how many choices you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve done a survey over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that angabegemäß a typical americans in a day is 70. .
in addition recently , a study has been made a study in which they saw the ceos for a week .
and these scientists have just been documenting the different topics with these ceo , and how much time they spent making decisions that relate to the subjects .
and they &apos;ve found that an average ceo busy in the week with 139 tasks .
so each one of these subjects was , of course , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions took them an hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions .
you know how many decisions do you do in the nine minutes of category against the one hour of category ?
how well do you think , are you dealing with that ?
today , i want to talk about one of the largest entscheidungsprobleme of our modern time , the entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise raise , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , please , i &apos;m going to ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question for today is : are you ready to hear about the entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem ?
thank you .
when i was a abschlussstudent at stanford university , i went to this very exklusiven store , at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called draeger .
this business , it was almost like a vergnügungspark .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and essig and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different types of water -- and that was at a time when we actually got leitungswasser .
i loved it to this business , but at a moment i asked myself , well , how do you never do anything ?
here &apos;s the olive olive gang .
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those who were locked in boxes that came out of thousands of years .
so i decided to go to the leader one day , and i asked the head , &quot; does this model , &quot; does this model that people really ? &quot;
and he showed up the busladungen of tourists that came every day and usually had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose marmelade for our experiment .
here &apos;s her marmeladen gang .
they had 348 different kinds of marmelade .
we &apos;ve set up a little verkostungsecke right on the entrance .
we &apos;ve got six different geschmacksrichtungen or 24 different kinds of marmelade , and we looked at two things : first , i think , what would be more people going to stay and probieren ?
there are more people left when they were 24 , about 60 percent when they were six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we looked at what people were doing rather a glass of marmelade .
now we saw the opposite effect .
from the people who were left when they were 24 , only three percent bought a glass of marmelade .
from the people who were left when it was six , now we saw that 30 percent of you actually bought a glass of marmelade .
well , if you calculate it , people bought six times a glass of a glass , who they had six times of the choice when they had 24 .
now , not to decide a glass of marmelade is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem is influenced us in very konsequenzreichen decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it &apos;s against our own best interests .
so , for the day of the day , resource save .
now , i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m going to describe with gur huberman , emir kamenica , wei jang , in which we make decisions for retirement of almost a million americans in the entire united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of fondsangebote that were possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to have the 401 plan , the probability of whether will be saved tomorrow .
and we found that there was a connection in fact .
so in this plans , we had about 657 plans who had offered something between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund were offered , that , indeed , that , in fact , was lower .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans that offered two fund , they had a teilnahmerate in the &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that offered almost 60 fund fund , the teilnahmerate was now on about the sechzigsten prozentanteil .
now imagine that even if you &apos;re going to participate in entschliessen , if you have more ways of choice , then you have negative consequences .
so , the people who decided to participate in the fact that the more ways that the more possibilities were left , the more it , the more you to choose to choose it and choose .
the more possibilities they were available , the more they had their money in pure geldmarktkonten .
none of these extreme decisions , belongs to the decisions that people recommend if we care about the future financial well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential negative consequences that make it from more and more choice .
it schieben the decision -- push yourself , even if it &apos;s against your own best interest .
they make more inferior decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more going to decide for things that they make themselves less , even if they make an objective better .
so the main reason for this is that we may enjoy this huge set of mayonaise , mustard , mustard , essig and marmelade , but we in fact , in fact , in the way , and then we can actually choose something out of the fantastic offer .
so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in different ways and different forschungsorten -- they can just use in their business .
first , limited .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never true of true than today that less is less .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; close . &quot;
they are always worried they lose regalfläche .
but in fact , it &apos;s more and more than that , and more and more that if you &apos;re willing to go and more and more , that if you &apos;re ready to be ready , then there , you know , there &apos;s a rise of sales , it will be gesenkt , &amp; amp amp ; and there &apos;s a improvement improvement .
as a proctor and gamble , the different head and gamble the different head of 26 in 15 , you know , you have a rise of sales to 10 percent .
when the golden cat corporation put her 10 to the schlechtesten corporation , she &apos;d experienced that it &apos;s about 80 percent anstiegen -- a result of the two , the rise of sales and reducing cost .
you know , the average supermakrt today offers to you .
a typical walmart gives you 100,000 products today .
but the neuntgrößte supermarket , who is neuntgrößte in the world today is aldi , and they only give them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomatensauce in a dose .
now , in the world of sparens , i think one of the best examples that had recently come on to the market , about how to managt the choice , was something that david laibson has very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
every single harvard staff is actually taking automatically in a lebenszeitfond part .
the ones that really want to make a selection will be offered 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know , how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to pass it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t auseinanderhalten them , they can &apos;t do their customers . &quot;
now before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he &apos;s willing to be willing to offer all the people in this audience in this audience at a all-inklusive on the most beautiful road in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read you that .
and now i &apos;ll give you a couple of seconds to read you , and then i &apos;m going to clap you to clap if you &apos;re willing to embrace gary .
okay . everybody who &apos;s ready to take gary &apos;s offer .
are that all ?
well , let me show you a little bit more about it .
you knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
good .
in fact , that you &apos;ve been looking at the first time in the first time more information than the second time , but i would make it a car to guess that it really felt real .
because the images made it real sense for them .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of entscheidungsüberlastung , it &apos;s the konkretisierung .
it &apos;s about being able to understand the difference between possibilities , understanding what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities and feel these consequences of these consequences .
why are people giving up about 15 to 30 percent more to 30 percent more , if you use a ec-karte or a card card , than in cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t really matter money .
and it turns out that if you make it that something feels concrete , it feels a very good tool , so you &apos;re getting people to save more .
so in a study that i &apos;ve done with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero , we &apos;ve done a study with the people in ing -- employees who worked all for ing -- and these people were all in a gathering where they signed their participation to their participation .
and during this session , we &apos;ve got this gathering just as leave as she was , just as it was , we just added one little added .
the little thing that we add to it was that we were asking people to think of the positive things that would happen in their lives when they save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation over 20 percent , and there was an increase of the number of people who were willing to save or we were willing to save four percent of the amount that they were willing to pay for the sparkonto .
the third technique : kategorisierung .
we can do better with more categories than dealing with more choices .
so , for example , for instance , a study we &apos;ve done in a zeitschriftengang .
it turns out that it turns up in the wegmans up and down in the northeast area , the number between 331 different types of magazines to very high magazines .
but you know what ?
if i &apos;m going to show you 600 categories , and you put them in 10 categories , and they put them in 20 categories , believe that i &apos;ve given them more choice and a better auswahlerfahrung , when i gave them the 400 of them , if i gave them the 400 .
because the categories tell me how i can keep them apart .
here are two different schmuckauslagen .
one is called jazz , and the other is called &quot; swing . &quot;
if you think that the left display is swing , and the ad on the right of the jazz is , you clap in your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
if you think that on the left-hand side of jazz is jazz and the right on the right side , you &apos;re clapping .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the left on the left-hand side is jazz jazz is jazz , but you know what ?
this is a highly unnützes kategorisierungsschema .
the categories have to say something that doesn &apos;t make the choice .
and this is a lot of times , if you look at the long list of all these fund .
who are you going to inform ?
my fourth technology : premise for complexity .
it turns out that , in fact , we can deal with more information than we think , we just simplify them .
we need to increase the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german autohersteller that gives you the opportunity to konfigurieren your car .
you have to make 62 different decisions to design your car .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices that they offer a decision .
autofarben , außenfarbe of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , prototypes -- four possibilities .
now , what i do now is , i change the order to make the decisions .
half of the customers is going to go from many of the many possibilities autofarben , in the low ways , four .
the other half of the customers goes from the low possibilities , four strains , to the 56 autofarben , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how are they interested .
if you &apos;re constantly using the standardauswahl of the decision , that means that it &apos;s shocked , the heisste , i &apos;m losing it .
what you find out is that the people who go from the many to the low auswahlmöglichkteiten , and over and over and over again .
we lose it .
go from the little choice to the many choices , then they stay .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order to change this information .
when i start with the simple , i &apos;m learning how i &apos;m auswähle .
even though , even though , even though , even though , i don &apos;t have anything about my preferences in the interior , make it still ready to pick me .
and it also versetzt me on the big product that i &apos;m zusammenstelle , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate myself to be able to get interested in it .
let me summarize .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that the problem of entscheidungsüberlastung mildern -- just -- you &apos;re going to do it real alternative ; konkretisieren -- do it real ; we put it better with more categories , less possibilities , ready to complexity .
each of these techniques i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help them manage the possibilities -- good for them , they can use them for themselves , good for people who they provide service .
because i think that the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re selective .
and the more we are wählerisch , the more we are able to be able to be able to make the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allocca , trends-manager at youtube . i look at youtube-videos .
that &apos;s true .
now we want to talk about how videos are going to be viral , and then why this is important .
we all want to be stars -- berühmtheiten , singers , comedians -- when i was young , it seemed so infinitely difficult .
but webvideos enables us to get all of us , or all of our creative activities in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous to the internet to next saturday .
but for youtube , there &apos;s more than 48 hours of video .
again , only one tiny percentage will ever look at thousands of times and it will look at thousands of times .
so how does this work ?
three things : tastemaker , teilnahmecommunities and the unexpected .
well , we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
woah !
ohhhhh , wowwww !
last year sendete bear vasquez dieses this video he was filmed his house in the yosemite national park .
in 2010 , there was 23 million .
this graph shows how it looked like when the video was popular for the first time .
actually , bear didn &apos;t want to make a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing that , if you &apos;re yosemite mountain .
he had posted every lot of naturvideos .
and this video was actually sent on in january .
what &apos;s happened here ?
there was jimmy kimmel .
jimmy kimmel sendete den the tweet that the video ended up so popular .
because tastemaker like jimmy kimmel ask us new and interesting things and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s the friday , friday . gotta on friday , weekend . everybody s to the weekend , weekend . friday , friday . gettin on friday . she didn &apos;t think that we would run that conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
rebecca blacks &apos;s &quot; one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was almost 200 million times this year .
this is what the graphics looked like .
just like &quot; the double rainbow &quot; seems to be made out of nothing .
what happened that day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also freitage .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
now , tosh.0 gabelte , viele , many blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson of the mystery science of the mystery was a first one who made a joke to take a joke on this .
what &apos;s important is that one individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view , with a big audience and beschleunigte the process .
and then this community was created by people who shared these big insiderwitz , and began to talk about it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 parodien of &quot; friday &quot; on youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a parodie for every single week .
unlike the einseitigen entertainment conversation in the 20th century , part of the community is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by using it or something new .
&quot; nyan cat &quot; is animation and music in endlosschleife .
this is , very simple .
this year was nearly 50 million times .
and if you put this for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a dreistundenversion that has been looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
important , the creativity that &apos;s in the internetkultur of the techies and geeks .
there were remixe .
somebody made an altmodische version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole remix-gemeinde shot from the floor that made it from a dumb joke to something that we all participate in .
today , we &apos;re not going to find pleasure on something , we do .
who could have voraussehen all of this ?
who could have predicted the &quot; the &quot; double &quot; double black or rebecca &quot; can predict ?
what would you be able to write in that sort of drinsteht ?
in a world that every minute of a minute of video , it can only be posted to a unique and unexpected hervorstechen like the video .
i admit i was not really interested in , when a friend said to me , i should look at this great video , about a guy in new york on strafzettel .
i got a ticket because i &apos;m not on the radweg , but often , but often there are disabilities who don &apos;t let you go properly .
because this was completely surprising and humorous , casey niestats was fun idea , and his argument was five million times .
this approach is true for everything we &apos;re going to do .
and all of this leads to a big question ...
what does that mean ?
ohhhh .
what does that mean ?
tastemaker , creative teilnehmergemeinden , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture , who has access to anyone in the audience .
as i said , one of the currently largest stars -- justin &apos;s justin -- took his beginning to youtube .
nobody has to give your ideas to the green light .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as owners of our culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they also barely meet the media from today , but they will determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
now , in 10 minutes of this connectedness , when she had to talk about 30 years ago , and like the amazing strength of this connectedness in a little bit of the connectedness , where she was sitting in a little bit about 30 years ago in a small boat in the chinese sea , a connectedness that goes on in the life of this little girl , and never disappeared -- this little girl , which is now living in san francisco and talk to you today ?
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still combined .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzlestückchen .
imagine the first piece : a man who is burning his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose entire life of the very simple hope of oneness and freedom of his home .
keep him on the einmarsch of the kommunisten in saigon , as he has to recognize that his life has been a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , spotteten now .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken by the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me forget .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was really trying to zerdrücken us , but we was through it .
the next puzzleteil shows how a boat in the early morgenrot was silent on sea .
my mother may be 18 when her father died -- already in a arrangierten marriage , with two little girls .
for her , they had a job for her : the flucht of their family and a new life in australia .
it was completely ausgeschlossen that she could fail .
after a four and filmreifen saga glitt , a boat still on the lake , as a fischerboot .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear of piraten them , rape , rape and death .
like most of the adults on the boat , my mother was wearing a little giftflasche .
in a gefangennahme , my sister and me , then , you and my grandmother , and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- so the stetige tuckern of the engine of a single wave of any wave on the bug , and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the piraten who came up with a lot of times , but from the todesmut of the men on our boat , or on the ausfall of the engine that didn &apos;t want to launch six hours .
but i remember the lights in front of the ölplattform of the malaysischen , and the young man , and the young man , and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first apfels that gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple ever tasted this .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next puzzlestück is about four women in three generations to build a new life .
we let &apos;s go down in footscray , one of the working that &apos;s arbeiterklasse , whose population is out of immigrantenschichten .
unlike the alteingesessenen , whose existence of me was completely unknown , there was no anspruchsdenken .
the smells of ladentüren came from the rest of the world .
and the fetzen were broken between people who had one thing in common : they started .
my mother worked on farms , then on one line in a autofabrik , six days , twice .
and they kind of managed to find the time to find english and it-qualifikationen .
we were poor .
every dollar has been given , and i was put into more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to get rid of it . mostly the new things that came out of second hand .
two strümpfe for school , every one , to cover the holes in the other .
a schuluniform to the knöcheln , because she had to get six years .
and there were the rare aber chöre from &quot; schlitzauge &quot; and here , and there , &quot; asian , go home . &quot;
where home ?
something versteifte in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a quiet voice , &quot; i &apos;m going to go from the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was all night , but we told each other from our day , and we were listening to the movements of our grandmother .
my mother suffered from alpträumen from the boat .
and it was my job to wake up every night , until their alpträume came , so i could aufwecken it .
she opened a computergeschäft , then made a kosmetikerausbildung and launched a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t ertrugen the change , angry and unflexibel , and sorgenerfüllte children , caught between two worlds .
loan and sponsoren were searching .
centers were built .
i lived in parallelwelten .
in one one , i was the classic asian student , the unerbittliche demand for himself .
in the other , i was involved in insecure life , the tragic scars scars violence , the drogenmissbrauchs and the isolierung .
but so many people got help over the years .
and because of this help , i &apos;ve been auserwählt in my last year , as a young australierin of the year .
and i was wurde from a puzzlestück to the next katapultiert , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous bewohnerin of footscray , was now tan , , and social activist , who has been invited to talk to places that they never heard of , and in homes , whose existence you could never have imagined .
i was not familiar with the etikette .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the besteck .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back into the routine , and the comfort of the life of an unknown vororts -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who abschlossen each of their days as well as 20 years when they told each other the stories of their day and einschliefen , we &apos;re still in bed .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was now as old as she was when we got the boat .
no , no way .
&quot; do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i spoke about jugendarbeitslosigkeit and education , and the vernachlässigung of the marginalisierten and entrechteten .
and the more i said , the more i should tell .
i met people in all lebenslagen , so many of them did what they loved , lived in the limits of the possible .
and even though i had my degree , i realized that i couldn &apos;t meet a career with a career .
there had to be another puzzlestück .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a außenseiter , a neuankömmling , and not just okay , but something you have to be grateful , maybe a gift of the boots .
because dazuzugehören can lead to collapse so easily , can mean so easy to make the assumptions of the environment .
now , i &apos;ve been enough to know enough to know that , yes , the world auseinanderbricht , but not how to do it .
options that would not have been allowed to be very ermutigt .
there was a energy , a unerbittlichen optimism , a strange mixtur of the humility and the wagnisses .
so i decided to follow my gut gut .
i collected a little team of people around me , for the schublade , &quot; not &quot; a unwiderstehliche challenge .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a cents .
at the end of one tags , i cooked a huge topf soup that we shared .
we worked late until the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant , and we managed to do the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull into the u.s.
after just a journey there .
my gut gut .
three months later , i was moved , and i went on .
before i put the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time , in the konfuzianismus , the social norm and the local mandarin was the most important person .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after their birth .
her mother moved them alone .
with 17 , she became the second woman &apos;s second her .
without support her man &apos;s man , she kept her for a sensation by putting it into a court and anklägerin in her own case , and a greater sensation when she won .
&quot; turns out to be unwahr .
i just duschte in a hotel room in sydney , when she died . 1,000 miles away .
i looked through the duschtrennwand , and i looked at the other side .
i knew she had come to say .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in footscray and were sitting around her .
we told her stories and versicherten her that we were still with her .
in order to midnight , the monk and said , he had to close .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of your hand is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because it &apos;s in this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they don &apos;t leave it out . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it goes through the women .
you see who we were and how the life we &apos;ve shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come in our lives have come to the quere .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to do my own children , and i think about the boat .
who would ever be one ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , vor , vor .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous of every wave , the unbeirrte , stetige of the engine , stetige , the long horizon horizon , which doesn &apos;t notice ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and it could be sicher , i would do it .
also , tans mother &apos;s mother is here in the fourth or five .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with them .
is it all at all ?
because this is , of course , a picture you can &apos;t take with your camera .
and yet , my interest in photography , when i got my first digital camera at age 15 years old .
and i put it with my earlier with drawing , but it was a little different , because it was using the camera in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera with a camera , the process , if you put it on the trigger .
so for me , photography seemed to be more about walking at the right place at the right time .
i thought everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts in the process of doing it .
photos like this : a lot along a lot of befahrenen street .
but it has an unexpected shift .
and yet , even a realistic level .
or photos like this -- dark and farbenfroh at the same time , but all with the shared goal to keep a realistic level .
when i say reality , i &apos;m meine .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can actually capture , but i always want to look like that , as if you could have that , in a photograph .
photos where you have to think about a brief moment to find out the trick .
so it &apos;s more likely to capture an idea as a moment .
what is the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details or the color ?
is it about the light ?
what is the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we &apos;re realistic for realistic .
so i think the essentials are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and you can put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect vaccine physical objects that we all relate to in a three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way of combined , you can do something that &apos;s still more three-dimensional than if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we überlisten our brains , because our brain just doesn &apos;t make sense that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining pictures .
it &apos;s really just to combine different realities .
so the things that make a picture of realistic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our daily lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about this , because otherwise you &apos;re just going to look down .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a realistisches outcome .
as you can see , that &apos;s not three special images .
but we can combine something special about this .
so the first rule is that combined pictures should have the same perspective .
secondly , put together the same beleuchtungsart .
and these two pictures meet these two demands -- the same altitude , and the same beleuchtungsart .
third , it &apos;s not possible to distinguish where the individual images are starting and end by using it transition .
it &apos;s impossible to say how this picture was actually put together .
so by the edge light , contrast , contrast , entsättigte , entsättigte , wie colors , entsättigte colors , like feldtiefe , entsättigte colors and disorders , we verwischen the boundaries between the various images and how a single picture look like a single photo , although an image can basically contain hundreds of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a landscape , and the bottom part was manipulated .
but this image is actually completely combined from photographs of different places .
i personally finde. that it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , as a place , because you don &apos;t have to get a compromise with the ideas in his head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been taken on a anglerausflug .
the bank comes from a different place .
the unterwasser-teil comes from a quarry .
and yes , i even have the house on the island of red umgefärbt to make it look .
to reach a realistisches outcome , it &apos;s from me to planning .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
this is about the combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s a very good piece .
and if you make good shots , it can be pretty beautiful , and it can be pretty realistic .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that &apos;s limited is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic gesundheits-projekte fail .
and i think the most important point is that , we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we &apos;ve introduced to the radboud-universität was , a haupt-zuhörer .
they &apos;re not particularly in particular -- it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea , and ask the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how are you ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want this to think that this is one of the main problems that everyone -- maybe most of the electronic gesundheits-projekte fail : because we stopped listening .
this is my wlan-waage . a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button .
and every morning i jump on it .
and yes , i have a job , as you might recognize .
i have my job for 95 pounds .
it &apos;s very simple , every time i jump on the scale , you send my data on google health .
and they &apos;re also going to get from my allgemeinarzt abgerufen , so he can see where my gewichtsproblem is , and it &apos;s not just in the moment that i need to support or i need to take a look at the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you know , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 follower on twitter .
so every morning i jump on my wlan-waage , and people talk to me before i &apos;m in the car , &quot; for lunch , just a little salat , lucien . &quot;
but this is the netteste thing that can happen because this is the gruppenzwang , gruppenzwang , to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could be patients smoking .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and to get them to play in some kind of a game to control their health .
next week it comes on the market .
it &apos;s going to give this little blutdruck-messgerät that you &apos;re going to do on an iphone or something like that .
and it will give people to measure their blood pressure to their blood pressure to send them to their physician , and for example , for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
at that point , the patients come into the game . they can &apos;t only be control , captain on their own ship , but they can also help us with health care in the face of the challenges that are in front of us , and the kostenexplosion of health , double demand , and so on .
make these ways to use to use , and they start using this to hug patients in the team .
and you can reach through these techniques , but also by crowdsourcing .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a short video .
we all have navigationssysteme in our cars .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
we know exactly where all of our own all around are around maastricht around .
we know another one , where all the gas is .
and clear , we can find fastfood-ketten .
but where is the next aed to help this patient ?
we have herumgefragt , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next life-saving aed was in this moment .
so , what did we do ? we did crowdsourcing in the netherlands .
we put a website , and a menschenmasse thought , &quot; if you see a aed , please share us , where it is , when he &apos;s got , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , of course , of course .
and over 10,000 aeds , they &apos;ve been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps .
and we have a ipad-app .
we &apos;ve developed an app for layar , extended reality to find these aeds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like maastricht , and someone , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , your microsoft-handy to find the next aed , you can save life .
and we don &apos;t just want to do this today as a aed4u , like the product calls , but as a aed4us .
and we want to bring this into a global scale .
and we ask our colleagues around all over the world , from other universities , from other universities , to help us see how knotenpunkte to behave like knotenpunkte around the world around the world .
and if you are in vacation and somebody else is your own blood or somebody else , you can find a aed .
the other thing we want to ask is that companies all around the world will help us with bestätigung these aeds .
these could be kurierdienste , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the gemeldete aed is still in its place .
please help us and try to improve health not only better , but take the hand .
thank you .
today , i &apos;m going to share with unexpected .
i work in solartechnologie-branche .
and my little startup wants to force us to the environment by ...
the crowdsourcing .
here &apos;s a short video of what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may be , until it geladen .
now -- we can just jump -- i &apos;m just going to jump the video ...
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
solartechnologie is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i have a program to get the stars in technology and design to work a year , which is pretty much all the things that they actually hate , what they &apos;re doing .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little like the friedenscorps for computerfreaks .
we choose some fellows every year and we &apos;ll let them work with stadtverwaltungen .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them into rathäuser .
and there they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what they really do is to show what is possible with technology today .
so you meet al .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
it looks like he looks after a date , but what he really is looking for is someone who freischaufelt him , when he &apos;s eingeschneit , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good at brandbekämpfung when he &apos;s from a meter of a meter .
how did he get to look for this particular way ?
we had a team of fellows in boston in the process of the &quot; code for america &quot; for america .
they were in february , and it has a lot of geschneit geschneit .
and they realized that the city never diese these fires .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik michaels-ober , noticed something else , and that was that the residents are frei the sidewalks , right in front of these parts .
so he did what every good engineers would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can fill a fire fire .
you stimmst to him frei if it schneit .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it off .
so there &apos;s a nice little dynamic dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest apps that are written in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other regierungstechnologie .
it &apos;s spreading rapidly .
there &apos;s this guy in the i.t. department of the city , who has seen that he could use this app , not to snow , but so that the citizens of tsunami-sirenen .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami-sirenen work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to get the verstopften gullys .
and chicago has just introduced it to the people &apos;s buergersteige when it schneit .
we now know nine cities , the plan to use this app .
and it has spread reibungslos , of course , of course .
if you know about regierungstechnologie , you know that it doesn &apos;t usually run that way .
the beschaffung of software takes a few years .
we had a team that worked last year in boston , for the three people for three people .
it was about a method that the parents can find out what the right public schools are for their children .
it was told us later that when it was about the normal channels , it took over two years , and it took over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
there &apos;s a project in the california , right now , which has paid two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that is written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading from selbt , is a kind of shot in front of the bow on the institution .
it shows how the government could work better -- no more like a private company , how many people think she should .
and not even like a technik-unternehmen , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more important about this app is that it represents a new generation that the problem of government -- not as the problem of a verknöcherten institution institution , but as a problem of collective trade .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good in the collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to do things effectively .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; there are hundreds of people around the country that get up and regierungs-apps , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re awful frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they fix them .
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all forget your feelings about politics and the snake , and all of the other things that are really upset about , government , in the core , in the heart of tim o reilly , &quot; what we can do in common that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people gave up the government .
and if you are one of those people , i &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re nachdenkst , because they &apos;re changing things .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally takes their power to us -- erinner you said , &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about how that change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and like a lot of people , i thought it was mainly about to choose people in a office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s especially in community , all about beutelratten .
this is the call call for service and information .
you usually come out when you anrufst in your city .
if you &apos;ve ever had the chance to work in your städtisches call call , like our fellow scott silverman , as part of the program -- in fact , do all of this -- you &apos;re going to see that the people who call government for many different problems , including that there is a beutelratte in your house .
so scott gets this anfruf .
he tippt &quot; beutelratte &quot; into the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the tierfänger .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can just open up all the doors in your house and play very loud music , and see if the livestock are abhaut ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the beutelratten .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
it has an app , a web- and handy-app , called &quot; citizens connect . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is work very intelligent people in the office of new urban urban urban mechanics in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- came in , &quot; beutelratte in my mülltonne . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; citizens connect &quot; is different .
scott went from human being .
but in &quot; citizens connect , &quot; it &apos;s public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post that we got said , &quot; i went over there , found the mülltonne behind the house .
beutelratte ? yes ? yap .
turned the mülltonne on the side . went home .
good night , honey beutelratte . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital that digital .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is crowdsourcing .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m more talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizens helped a other citizen , but the government was playing a central role .
they connected these two people .
and you could connect them with government services if they needed it , but a neighbor is a far better and billigere alternative to state services .
if a neighbor helps to the other , we empower our communities .
let &apos;s call the tierfänger , it costs a lot of money .
and one of the most important things is that we need to think that government is not the same thing as politics .
and most people understand that , but the most people understand that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution is for the system .
how often have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we &apos;ve taken a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re going to go back and expect the government to reflect our values , and then it doesn &apos;t change much ?
that &apos;s because the government is like a further ocean , and politics is the supreme 15cm .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with this contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt , which we have , and for that we have to pay for what we &apos;re going to work against us , something different , and then we entmachten ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want that institution to work for us , we have to make a bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the actual regierungsarbeit is happening .
we need to be about the machinery of government .
so the occupythesec-bewegung has done it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of more effective citizens that wrote a very detailed report , which is an answer to the sec-memo of the gesetzesvorlage .
it &apos;s not politically active , that &apos;s bürokratisch .
now , for those of us who gave up the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our kids .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to ask .
do we really believe that we do what we have to do without improving the institution an institution that &apos;s in the name of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology is going to make it , the function of the government in a way , in a way that actually can achieve something that is able to get stärkt society .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown up the mitdem internet , and the knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the only systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i am , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up to see her voice as granted .
they &apos;re not fighting that struggle that we all fight , about who &apos;s going to speak ; they can all speak .
they can make their opinion , in every channel at every time , and they do .
so , if you &apos;re confronted with the government , don &apos;t worry so much about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve government .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
and that could be , a fire hydranten , a mülleimer , a trash with a beutelratte .
and sure , we would have these hydranten that fire all the time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of the government that are paying taxes .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we won &apos;t improve the government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all got to you : if it &apos;s about the big , important things that we need to do together , all together , we will only be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands too ?
thank you .
it &apos;s usually my role to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are the new technologies that are the new technologies that are the new technologies that are the new technologies that are the new technologies that are the new technologies that are the new technologies that are the new technologies that are the new technologies that are the new technologies that are the new technologies that are the new technologies that are going to be on .
i &apos;m going to start with you just a single , boring slide .
now , you might just have the slide .
this is a slide that i have chosen from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , it &apos;s rather about the general form .
this slide shows a data of an analysis of an analysis of how we have compared to the performance of a local area .
the interesting one here is that this slide , as many others , which we often find in our field , is a kind of semi-logarithmischen curve .
in other words , every step here is a power in leistungsskala .
and this is a novelty that we need to use this guy on semi-logarithmischen curves in the field of technology .
something very strange is happening here .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so if you could turn the light back .
a little bit worse , because i &apos;m going to draw something on paper here .
now why do we draw graphs in the technology in semi-logarithmischen curves ?
the reason for this is , if i draw it a normal curve , where , you know , this is the years of a little bit of a way , the timeline of a way , and this is an beliebiges measure of technology that i want to represent with a graph , the graph is silly .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a transporttechnologie , and then this would be a transporttechnologie scale in the form of a flat line .
but if something like this , it changes the qualitativen circumstances .
so , as fast as quickly as the mikroprozessor-technologie progression , we could put übermorgen into a taxi taxi and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but it &apos;s not that fast .
that has never been before in the history of technologie-entwicklung , that kind of rekursivem growth , that &apos;s going to increase the scale all the few years .
so the question i want to ask you is if you look at these exponential curves , you see , you don &apos;t go forever .
it &apos;s not possible that all forever and forever evolved as fast .
there are two options .
either , it &apos;s going to be a classic s-kurve like this , you know , to something new , or it will happen here .
it &apos;s about it .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think this is what &apos;s going to happen here .
is that really , it means that means we &apos;re right now in the middle of a transition .
we are here on this line , in a transition from developing world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i also often ask myself , is like this new world will be ?
what is this new condition that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems to be very confusing , when you &apos;re in the middle .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people are talking about the future , and you realize that the future is still 2000 .
and we don &apos;t go on .
so in other words , the future is geschrumpft every year since i &apos;ve been on this world .
and i think the reason for this is we realize that anything is happening .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we know that there &apos;s just no sense to try to take 30 or 50 years to the future , because everything is going to be so different , that a simple hochrechnung of what we don &apos;t do is make sense .
so i want to talk about what that might be , this transition in which we are right now .
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk first about some other things that really don &apos;t really do with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we need to take a step back and look at the thing on one longer .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at on the zeitskala of the world &apos;s life .
i think the picture makes sense , if you put it unterteilt .
so let &apos;s go back , 2.5 billion years , the earth was a big , steriler steinklumpen with lots of chemicals with chemicals .
now , if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good image about how to do it .
now , i think there are theories that start to understand how everything has started to understand , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplistic story which is that at this time , at this time , is little öltröpfchen herumschwebten , which verschiedene different types of chemicals for chemicals .
some of these öltröpfchen enthielten a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals of the outside and grow .
all of those were , they started .
these little öltröpfchen were in the sense of the primitivste zellenform .
but these öltröpfchen weren &apos;t about living alive in today , because every single one of them was only one small , zufälliges recipe of chemicals .
and every time it shared , it turns out of chemicals into the other amounts of chemicals .
so every tröpfchen was a little different .
in fact , the tröpfchen , which is one for the growth of growth , had more faster composition than others and integrated , and more chemicals in the outside and shared faster .
so these tend to survive longer , and they &apos;re vermehrten in grösserem .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , if this tröpfchen , i learned a trick about abstraction .
any kind of thing that we don &apos;t quite understand , this is the ability to learn the ability to learn information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and in a particular chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they found a way in this geistlosen , evolutionary way , found a way that allowed to allow them to niederzuschreiben what this information was like , so that this information was stored and copied and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is that this kind of information over 2.5 billion years in which it happened , the same .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from the exact same code and the same .
in fact , every creature is exactly the same letters and the same code .
we are as far as we can do , just for the vergnügungszweck , even in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 mikrogramm of a white pulvers that i &apos;m trying to keep trying to keep out of the airports .
it &apos;s on -- what i &apos;ve done is , i took this code -- the code is from normal letters that we use to use -- and i &apos;ve written my visitenkarte on a piece of dna on a piece of dna , and it verstärkt it up 10 ^ 22 times .
so if someone wants a hundred million copies of my visitenkarte , i have enough for everybody in this room , and even for everybody in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was actually a egoist , i would have written her in a virus and put it into the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the niederschreiben of dna was an interesting step .
and the veranlagten of these cells -- they made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened , very interesting , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and because these cells started to communicate and share information , so that communities came from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually replace their dna .
this is why the reason for example of antibiotics grows to antibiotics .
some bacteria have found out how they can stay away from penicillin , and they put that information together with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have lots of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because the bacteria communicate .
this communication was now allowed to create communities that were in a certain sense of the same boat ; they were synergetisch .
so they either survived together , or they went down . that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were bevorzugt and the evolution .
the übergangsstelle is now where these communities are so close to that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community for the whole community .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at this point , we have mehrzellige communities , communities of many verschiedlichen zellentypen , which together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a mehrzellige community .
we have a lot of cells that are no more on themselves .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started weiterzuentwickeln , so that the level of evolution was happening , no longer the single cell cell , but the whole zellengemeinschaft that we call organism .
the next step has happened now within these communities .
the zellengemeinschaften started to abstract information .
and they developed special structures that did nothing else than making information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the informationsverarbeitungsapparat that created these zellengemeinschaften .
they started to train specialists in the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , and festhalten information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , at this point , at this point , at this point , is an individual -- learning now within the time of a single organism , instead of this evolutionary amount of time .
so , one organism could learn , for example , learning not to eat , because she was bad and made him sick , the last time he ate it .
now , this could be within a single organism in the lifespan of a single single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years , because this information had been learned from the individuals who died because of these fear , because these informationsverarbeitungsstrukturen were still not there .
so the nervous system has the evolutionsprozess with this particular informationsstrukturen , because evolution could now be within one individual .
it could happen within a time of time .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms had a way to communicate with each other .
and as an example , the raffinierteste of this is the human language is the human language .
it &apos;s a rather amazing invention when you think about it .
i &apos;ve got a very complicated , unordentliche and verwirrte idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;ll just give some of the sound of me , in the hope to create a similar idea in your head , which has some kind of a similarity with my original idea .
so we &apos;re going to take something very complicated , turning it into sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the head of others .
so this allows us to go again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we , is humanity , is , we started to abstract .
we go through the same steps , which has gone through mehrzellerorganismen -- the abstraction of our methods , how we visualize data , process .
and the invention of the language was a little step in that direction .
telefonie , computers , videobänder , cd-roms , and so on are all our committed mechanisms that we built in our community to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something that &apos;s bigger , and also able to develop faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today , evolution can happen in the period of microseconds .
you &apos;ve also seen tys little evolutionsbeispiel where he has shown a little evolution in the &quot; convolution &quot; program , right in front of your eyes .
so we have die the zeitskalen .
the first steps of the story that i told you is a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
then the nächstens steps , like language and so on , dauerten less than one million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , just seem to take a few decades .
and the process is feeding itself , and it &apos;s going to be , i think , auto-katalytisch is the word -- if something increases its änderungsgeschwindigkeit .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explosionsartigen curve curve .
we see the process that feeding itself .
i live a living of computers from computers , and i know that i could use the mechanism that i &apos;m using to use computers , not use without having the recently done in computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a lot of complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design these in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor in the verbindungsmaschine does .
it has billions of them .
but what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking about , as well , as the designers , we think , in a certain way , we think about this machine , and the machine does something that makes our skills far away , better and faster than we could ever do .
and it makes it partly with techniques that we don &apos;t even understand .
a method which is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve used in the last time , is evolution itself .
and we install a evolutionsprozess in the machine that &apos;s going on in mikrosekunden-bereich .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that evolves out of random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , generiere please , a hundred million of these sequences of instructions .
now , please take all these randomly chosen chosen instructions , take all of these programs , and then finally the people who are vorgaben on the next . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to figure out numbers , that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve been using for this .
so , find programs that can happen most often .
of course , the chance of random chosen instructions are very small that they sort of sort of numbers , so they &apos;re not going to be able to actually get any numbers of numbers .
but one of them may be a little bit of happiness in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take those 10 percent of the sequences that have come to my vorgaben .
put this off , lösche the rest .
now all the übriggebliebenen are übriggebliebenen that have the numbers of the numbers .
and that &apos;s with a method of the rekombinierens , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce children through exchange of their subroutinen , and the children are vererben the characteristics of the two programs .
so i &apos;ve got a new generation of programs that emerged by combinations of programs programs that are a little closer to the vorgaben .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
bewerte them again .
maybe a few mutations .
and try this again with another generation .
all of these generations only need few milliseconds milliseconds .
and so , i can take an evolution over millions of years in the computer in less minutes , or in more complicated cases , some hours .
finally , finally , i get programs that can sortieren the numbers .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i &apos;ve ever had by hand .
so when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
it &apos;s verworrene and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job , because you come from a series of hunderttausenden programs that have done the job .
because her life was on whether they were doing the job .
i sat back in a little bit together in a little bit together in a little bit together , he ale a map , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
there &apos;s this plane from hunderttausenden kleinteilen , which are working together to make your flight secure . &apos; does you don &apos;t do that ? &quot;
we know that a entwicklungsprozess isn &apos;t optimal if it &apos;s too complicated .
so we start to leave on computers , for a process , which is strong different from classical engineering engineering .
and he allows us to make things a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal ways to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it yet .
so , gewissermassen überflügelt us .
we &apos;re using these programs to make the computer much faster , so that we are able to do this processes even faster .
so it creates a rückkopplung .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies from themselves today are feeding themselves .
we go down .
we &apos;re at a point , which is analog to the time when einzeller-organismen has evolved to mehrzeller-organismen .
so we &apos;re the amöben , and we can &apos;t quite see what hell we &apos;re doing here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this übergangpunkt .
but i really believe that after us something else comes .
i think it &apos;s very hochmütig from us to say that we &apos;re the product of evolution .
and i think we all are part of the creation of what &apos;s going next .
well , that &apos;s the lunch before , and i think i &apos;m going to stop here before i &apos;m still rausgewählt .
my story starts right here in 1967 , about two years ago .
i was combined with the sky in the desert with sufi-sänger mukhtiar ali .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the time of the ancient indian epos mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted to travel indians then , we left into a car and schwirrten about the sky .
now we do this with airplanes .
then when the great indian indian kriegerprinz arjuna arjuna durst , he took a bow , went off in the floor and water .
now we do this with bohrern and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
it really made me sad .
i was afraid of technology .
i &apos;m afraid that i could lose the ability to be able to enjoy the sonnenuntergang , and without tweet my friends .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silberne taschenuhr .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the magischste thing for me .
it became a goldener access to a world full of pirates and verunglückter ships and in my imagination .
i was like that , as we thought of our sending us , and cameras from them .
they thought of being inspired by it .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic instead of killing magic .
with 16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling to connect the readers around the world .
it can know how we keep it .
it can know where we are .
it takes pictures and text together , and animation , sound and touch .
it used to be more senses .
but what do we do with this ?
i &apos;m just going to khoya , an interactive ipad app .
it says , &quot; put your fingers on any light . &quot;
and so -- here is , &quot; this box , &quot; i &apos;m writing my name .
and from me , a character in the book .
and again , a letter for me -- and the ipad knows by gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the child in me is really excited about this .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean it with that with a magician , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
just in a glass , i found always exciting .
so you have to throw the ipad on the ipad and rauslassen .
and the light on the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a kid is that a whole galaxy can be in a single murmel .
and so every book is going to be a little murmel , which is a little murmel i put up here in the magic device in the device .
and this opens a map .
fantasybücher had always been maps , but these maps were static .
this map is growing , and it serves , and it serves in the rest of the book .
it also shows other places of the book .
i &apos;m going in here .
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that indisch is also very zeitgemäß .
these are the apsaras .
we &apos;ve all heard of feen and nymphen , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the apsaras ?
the poor apsaras was caught thousands of years in indras kammern , in an old muffigen book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary story for children .
a story that auseinandersetzt with new issues , like the umweltkrise .
the theme of umweltkrise , a big problem of the last 10 years is that children sitting in their rooms , in their computers , without out .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search , you &apos;ve got to go out and collect images of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of stöckern , rocks , kieseln and muscheln .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do anymore .
this is kindheitsritual . you have to go out to take a picture of a flower and to tag .
in another chapter , you have to have a piece of baumrinde fotographieren and tag .
so you can actually create a digital collection of photos of photographs that you can put online .
a child in london shows the image of a fuchses and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually took .
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities to connect the world and technology and technology .
in the next book , we &apos;re using a interaction in which the video of the ipads , and through augmented reality , an animation of elfen , which appears to appear on a plant .
at a point , the screen füllt with leaves .
you have to take the sound of the winds , and read it away and reading the book .
we all move to a world where the natural nature of technology are closer to the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and closer to the natural world , and the magic of the magic and the magic , and the love of our childhood , by the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in untersuchungshaft , prisons or todeszellen .
i spend most of my time with the social worst in the sozialbausiedlungen and in places where there &apos;s a lot of despair .
here at ted , to see and listen and listen to , you &apos;ve given me a lot of force .
in the short time here , here became a clear : ted has an identity .
you can say things that have influence worldwide .
and sometimes , when something about ted , it gets meaning and force that otherwise didn &apos;t have .
i say that because i believe that identity is very important .
we saw some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher has meaning , but the words of a driven teacher are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good , as a fürsorglicher doctor , but you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i was big in a family , a traditional afroamerikanischen household , which was dominated by a matriarchin , and this matriarchin was my grandmother .
she was a taffe , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every familienstreit .
she was also the origin of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a sklavenfamilie .
their parents were born in the 1840ern in virginia when slaves were born .
it was born and the experience , and the experience of slavery was very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also liebevoll .
when i met her as a little boy , she came up to me and umarmte .
they hit me so that i could barely breathe . then let me go .
one or two hours later , when i came up with her , she came up to me and said , &quot; bryan , do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said &quot; no , &quot; i said , &quot; oh , you know , again , when i said , &quot; yes , &quot; i said it .
she was something that made that was that you were always going to be close .
the only problem is that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of their 10 children .
sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins walked around .
i remember , i have to be eight or nine , that i woke up one morning and the living room , all my cousins walked around .
my grandmother was at the end of the zimmers and looked at me .
first , i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and was smiling , but she looked very seriously .
that was like 15 or 20 minutes . then she stood up to me , and she took me over , and she said , &quot; come on , come up . you know , you know , we have to talk . &quot;
and i remember if it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out , and he said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise you you &apos;re not weitersagst . &quot;
i said , &quot; i promised , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; ehrenwort ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
and then she said , &quot; you have to promise me three things , bryan . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i &apos;m going to love your mom always . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise to promise you &apos;re going to care about them . &quot;
i touch my mother , so i said , &quot; yeah , grandma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next versprich me , you &apos;re going to do the right thing . &quot; also , if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise to me is that you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
now , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south and i have a brother who &apos;s older a year and one year , and one year .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home one day , and he brought this sixpack beer with grabbed my sister and i went to the forest .
we just alberten around there .
then he took a quick schluck beer and offered my sister &apos;s sister , and she took it , and then offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no , you know . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , make sure . today , we &apos;re doing that , but all we do .
i had what , your sister had what . go , trink a beer .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . it &apos;s just makes you do it .
my brother looked at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , what &apos;s going on . &quot;
and then he looked at me in the face and said , &quot; oh no , no , you don &apos;t still make you crazy because of the conversation ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells all the grandchildren they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was destroyed on the ground .
i &apos;m going to say something .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
this is perhaps wird public .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m gestehe that i never drink a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that , because i believe it &apos;s tugendhaft . i say that , because identity does .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people around us , which they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course my grandmother would tell all your grandchildren , be something special .
my grandfather was in prison .
my uncle died of alkoholinduzierten diseases .
and she believed that these are the subjects that we need to take care about .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our justizsystem .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
back , 300,000 were 300,000 in haftanstalten and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest inhaftierungsrate in the world .
seven million people are released , or with bedingter strafaussetzung .
and in my opinion , i think of our world has fundamentally changed .
in socially faint and black parts of the population , despair are herrschen despair , because of these changes .
one of three male black , black and 30 and 30 is in prison , in prison , in the prison , or mit .
throughout urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles in the country -- from los angeles to washington , &quot; 50 to 60 percent of the black young young men either , either in prison , in prison , in the prison , or bewährung .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with rassenzugehörigkeit , and it &apos;s entstellt through poverty .
we have a justizsystem in this country that they &apos;ve been treated much better when they &apos;re rich and guilty as poor and innocent .
money , not verschulden , it affects the result .
and yet , we seem to be happy with it .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
i find this interesting .
there &apos;s some hochinteressante developments developments .
the middle of course , my home , entzieht , constantly das , constantly , if you strafrechtlich strafrechtlich .
here in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population have lost their wahlrecht .
we prognostizieren that in 10 years , the ratio of the aberkennung of the civic brain will be as high as the verabschiedung of the wahlrechtsgesetzes .
the silence is ohrenbetäubend .
i vertrete kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world , verurteilt children to death in prison .
in this country , there are kinder haftstrafen haftstrafen without bedingte .
we &apos;ve been running a lot of things .
the only country in the world .
i vertrete people in todeszellen .
the death penalty is an interesting question .
we believe , because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is : has a person to die for one of him to die ?
this is a very sensible question .
but you can also think about it differently , depending on how we see our identity .
the other perspective is not : anybody earned death for a crime , but : did we deserve to kill it ?
i find that fascinating .
death penalty in america is defined by error .
at nine people we &apos;ve been executed , come from one that we were befunden for innocent , the entlastet and the death row .
an amazing fehlerquote . one of nine innocent .
i find that fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane , if for nine planes , they &apos;re going to turn up .
but somehow we create it , from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question of whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting , because i have my students on afroamerikanische history , i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time against the end of the world war , until the beginning of the 2 world war .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
but for the afroamerikaner afroamerikaner in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynchmobs .
or to bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
and these older people come to me and say , &quot; mr , stevenson , they &apos;re talking to me , they tell people that they should stop saying that , for the first time in the history of our nation with terrorism , after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and to the terrorism , of course , of course , of course , the rassentrennung and decades , of course , the most of course , for decades .
and yet , in our country , there is a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what meaning our actions have in the historical context .
we are all the time .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the truth of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that this is not to overcome the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , they were these willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve held some talks in germany about the death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and i said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply verstörend to hear about . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , you can never give any more . &quot;
there was a silence . then a woman said , &quot; with our history , it &apos;s impossible that we &apos;ll ever kill ourselves for the systematic .
it would be gewissenlos of us , consciously and take care of people .
i thought about it .
as it would feel like to live in a world in the german state , in the german state of people , especially if there was a lot of jews under a lot of jews .
it would be unerträglich .
it would be gewissenlos .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old südens , we set people up -- here is the risk of being convicted of black , when it &apos;s black , and when it &apos;s black times higher , when the angeklagte is black , and the victim knows -- in the same states , in their earth , the body gelynchter people &apos;s body .
and yet , there &apos;s these mental abkopplung .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with this , with these difficult issues , then the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but eventually , these realities are überschattet of suffering , abuse , herabsetzung , ausgrenzung .
i &apos;m important to unite both .
because we finally talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to be in a complex world .
for me , the time for me is to think and talk about the poor , the benachteiligten , who are never going to be at ted .
but think about a way that is integrated in our own life .
we all have to believe in things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re so rational , so we appreciate intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development doesn &apos;t just come out of our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s these kopf-herz-verbindung that i think i believe , not only to be open for all the light and begeisternden things , but also for the dark and the dark and problematischen .
vaclav havel , the great tschechische politicians , once said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe against oppression , we wanted everything . but what we needed most was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness , sometimes to be in places , to be witness .
this mental orientation is the core of what i think you need to get involved in .
there &apos;s no line of technology and design that allows us to be very human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , ausgrenzung and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenges a lot more from us than if we didn &apos;t take care about that .
it &apos;s going to touch it deeply .
as a young lawyer , i hatt the great privilege of meeting pink parks .
and again , again , when they came back to montgomery , where they had two of their oldest friends , traf. , who had two of their elders -- an incredible afroamerikanerin -- an incredible afroamerikanerin -- and virginia virginia durr , a white person , whose husband , clifford durr , dr. king vertrat .
so these women came together , and they just talked .
and to rief , woman carr me and i said , &quot; bryan , woman parks parks in the city . we want to talk .
do you want to dazukommen and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , very much . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you are here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and just stopped .
it was always so inspiring , so beflügelnd .
and one day , i was sitting there , and after a few hours , and after a few hours , ms. parks turned to me to say , &quot; well , bryan , tell me what this is the initiative for same .
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to work against injustice .
wr want to help people who were convicted of innocent .
we want to fight the bias and we want to fight .
we want to end lebenslängliche haftstrafen without bedingte ohne for children .
we want to do something about the death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of deaths .
we want to end masseninhaftierungen . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; mhmm . mhmm . &quot;
she said , &quot; this is going to make it very , very tired . &quot;
and then she put a finger on my face , and he said , &quot; and so they have to be very , very tapfer . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be tapferer .
we need to make ways to put these challenges of these challenges : these problems , that sorry .
because finally , our humanity depends on our humanity , from our all humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every human on the planet .
if somebody &apos;s lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t hear it , he &apos;s not just a plant .
even who kills someone is not just a murderer .
and because this is , there is a basic human dignity that has to respect the law .
and i think that in many parts of this country , in many parts of the earth , in many parts of the earth , is not wealth .
i don &apos;t believe that .
i think , in many places in many places the opposite of poverty .
and finally , i think , even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so anregend , at the end , we won &apos;t be measured at the end of our technology , not the things that we develop , not in our intellect and minds .
finally , a society is not measured how they &apos;re going to be rich powerful and powerful and the powerful , as they deal with the poor , the verurteilten , the inhaftierten .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us out .
sometimes i &apos;m losing that balance . a story .
sometimes i press .
i &apos;m getting tired how we all .
sometimes the ideas of our thinking is , in very important ways .
i vertrete these kids who have been convicted of very hard .
i go to the untersuchungsgefängnis and visit , and i &apos;m going to visit a client and 14 years old , and it &apos;s supposed to be as an adult .
so i wonder , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn somebody into something that he isn &apos;t ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a kid .
i stayed up at one night at night , and i thought , my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , he must have zauberkräfte .
right , bryan , the judge has zauberkräfte .
you should also want them .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think more right , i began to work on .
i had a 14jährigen , poor black boys as a client .
and i started with this antrag . the headline said , &quot; antrag , the poor , 14jährigen black clients like a privileged , white , 75jährigen topmanager . &quot;
in my antrag , i explained that error was fehlverhalten and the police and verfahrensfehler .
there was a crazy line on that there was nothing in this country that there &apos;s no more rechtens .
the next morning i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i was just writing this crazy antrag or actually wrote him .
and to my shock , i didn &apos;t just write it , but sent to the court .
a few months over and i had just forgotten everything .
and finally , i decided , my god , i &apos;ve got to go to the dish and this crazy case .
i went into the car , and was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
and finally , i went out of my car and went up to the dish .
when i was the staircase to the dish , there was an elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and umarmte me .
then he did flüsterte me .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud to you . &quot;
and i have to say that there was power .
it touched something very deeply in me , identity , the ability to contribute to each individual , to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i walked up the gerichtssaal .
as soon as the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , did you ask that crazy . &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
more people would come in , just because they were angry .
i wrote these crazy things .
polizeibeamte came in and stellvertretende staatsanwälte and büroangestellte .
in the handumdrehen , the gerichtssaal was full of people who were angry that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my augenwinkel , i saw the janitors on and down .
he always looked through the window and she could hear the whole tohuwabohu .
he went and down .
after all , this older man came up with a very besorgten gesichtsausruck in the gerichtssaal and sat down behind me , almost on the verteidigungsbank .
10 minutes later , the judge quit a pause .
during the break came in a polizeibeamter , it felt that the janitors was in the gerichtssaal .
this deputy ran over the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do they do ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i get started to say this young man , you don &apos;t lose the goal out of the eyes . don &apos;t give up . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think that many of you understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far weit , but it &apos;s the justice .
that we &apos;re not completely developed as humans , unless we care about human rights and grundwerte .
that our survival of survival is the survival of every single one .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , from entertainment and creativity with humanity , pity and justice .
and most of all , i want to share with those of you who are just saying , just say , don &apos;t lose the goal of the eyes . don &apos;t give up .
you have this audience in this audience , that community is a obvious wish , and i hear you and do something .
what else can we do ?
bryan stevenson : well , there are possibilities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a volksentscheid in this spring where it &apos;s about trying to actually make a effort , something about the geldstrom umzuleiten , which is in the politics in politics .
and here , in california , for example , in the next five years , you &apos;re going to be a billion dollars for the death sentence for a billion dollars .
and yet 46 percent of aller don &apos;t end with a verhaftung .
56 percent of all vergewaltigungsfälle don &apos;t come to the court .
here &apos;s the chance to do something .
so this is going to suggest that referendum money in more sicherheitskräfte and security .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the verbrechensrate is tremendously down in america .
this fact is often going to be asked into a context .
what would you tell someone who believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of gewaltverbrechen has not changed very much .
most of the masseninhaftierungen in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of gewaltverbrechen .
it was the fehlgeleitete kreuzzug against drugs .
that &apos;s why the dramatic numbers come in .
we have hinreißen from the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have drei-verstöße , &quot; -gesetze , &quot; people for the immer , for a fahrraddiebstahl , diebstahl good , rather than that you force them to get the sacrifice .
i think we need to do more to help people , the victims of a straftat , not less .
and i think that our current don &apos;t help anyone .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
bryan , you really have a string here to schwingen .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
thank you for coming to ted . thank you .
his death is taking an average gefahrenrisiko .
two : famine in somalia -- three : pfefferspray of the police .
4 : bösartige kartelle . five : dangerous kreuzfahrtschiffe .
6 : social verfall , 65 : 65 dead .
eight : tsunamiwarnung : cyber-attacken .
different speakers : drogenkrieg . tornado . tornado .
recession . stillstand . egypt . egypt . egypt . egypt .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips that i collected over the past six months -- but the last six days , or the last six years .
in fact , the media would prefer to show us negative subjects because our minds are getting attention to these issues .
and there &apos;s also a good reason for this .
every second every second every second , our senses our senses more information than our brain can ever process .
and because it &apos;s not more important than our survival , the first stop for all the information is a part of our temporallappens .
so the guards is our frühwarnsystem , our gefahrendetektor .
it sortiert and durchkämmt the whole information on the search for all the andeutung in our environment .
so when we see the news , we prefer it to look for negative news .
and the old saying , &quot; if it &apos;s blutet , the demand is very true .
now , with all of our digital devices , at seven days , 24 hours a week , 24 hours a day , 24 hours a day , all this negative news is not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is always worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the tremendous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century , in the last century , is so strong that it will be possible in the next three decades to create a world of surplus .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , artensterben , water water and energieprobleme -- we already have .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at solving problems in a very long view , but then ultimately overcome .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
over the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled that &apos;s angepasste durchschnittseinkommen the world &apos;s population .
child mortality has been verringert .
and it &apos;s that the ernährungs- , elektrizitäts- transport- , and communication cost of cost .
steve pinker showed us that we &apos;re currently living in a very peaceful period of life .
and according to charles kenny , the alphabetisierungsquote has gone up from 25 percent years from 25 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
in fact , we haben poverty .
consider that a great percentage of americans who live under poverty , access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , tv , mobile phones , klimaanlagen and cars .
the richest of the last century , the imperatoren of the earth , could never have been able to dream of dream .
the basis of a lot of them form technologies , and these are growing .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , is macht , and the preis-performance-quotient is doubling every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone , in your pocket , is about a million times less than a supercomputer in the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how smooth it is -- in good times , war or peace , economic , depression and hochkonjunktur .
this is the result of faster computers that build faster computers .
it &apos;s not slowed down for any of our big problems .
also , despite her logarithmic verlaufs on the left , it &apos;s rising up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available all .
&quot; cloud-computing , &quot; something that my friends , 3d printer , 3d printer , that allow my friends to democratize the planet on our planet , synthetic biology , fuels , impfungen and food , digital medicine , nano-materialien and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibms &apos;s watson watson watson ?
that was big .
i &apos;ve looked at newspapers and looking for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson bezwingt human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
so imagine that this artificial intelligence were available to every owner .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i was here at ted a new university called &quot; singularity university . &quot;
we bring all of our students to all these technologies , with special focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students to create business , products and services that are within a decade in a decade a positive life from billions of people .
think about that one group of students today can affect the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this was ridiculous .
today , we can have gone with dozens of companies that have made this .
and if i think of abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of opportunities .
it &apos;s about creating abundance of knappen goods .
so scarcity is kontextbezogen , and technology is a resources .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of napoleon iii. in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of siam for dinner .
napoleons soldiers got silber-besteck , napoleon himself .
the king of siam , but the king .
aluminium was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and platin .
this is why the dome of the washington-monuments was made from aluminium .
even though aluminium percent of the erdmasse takes up , it &apos;s not a pure metal .
it &apos;s being connected to oxygen and silikate .
but then the technology of the elektrolyse has evolved and made aluminiumherstellung so cheap that we use it with our wegwerf-mentalität .
so let &apos;s project this analogy for the future .
we think of energieknappheit today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet of 5.000-mal more energy than we use a year .
16 terawatt energy prasseln every 88 minutes of the earth &apos;s land .
it &apos;s not a scarcity , the problem is .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time , the cost of solar in india is to reduce 50 percent in india -- 8.8 , 8.8 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar power fell 50 percent in the last year .
last month , this is published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sunny parts of the united states , solar &apos;s six cents per kwh , compared to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have a energieüberschuss , we will also have water on the surplus .
let &apos;s talk about wasser-kriege .
do you remember , as an carl , the voyager-raumfahrzeug in 1990 , when it was on saturn , what was going back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how was it ?
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a wasserplaneten life .
we live on a planet that is covered by 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s 97,5 percent water , two percent are vereist , and we &apos;re fighting for 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new nanotechnologien on the way , nano-materialien .
and from a conversation today with dean kaman , one of the innovators i &apos;d like to do it with dean -- he gave me permission -- his technolgie , who &apos;s called &quot; slingshot , &quot; and that many of you may have heard about it . it &apos;s the size of a kühlschranks .
it can create a thousand liter of clean drinking water a day from different sources -- whether salzwasser , verschmutztes water , latrine -- and all of this for less than two cents a liter .
the president of coca-cola is just eingewilligt , a large test-projekt with a hundred units in the developing world .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola is going to apply this technology globally in 206 countries all over the planet .
this is technologieunterstützte innovation that &apos;s there today .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
you know , my god , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of mobile phones in developing the developing world to the end .
just think that a massai-krieger with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better mobil-kommunikation in the middle of kenya 25 years ago .
and if you look for your smartphone to google , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has the information and communication , as no one could ever have predicted .
and it comes even better , the things that you and i spent a thousand dollars on -- gps , hd-video and photograph , libraries full of books and music , technology to medical name -- are literally entmaterialisiert and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best part of this is possibly what &apos;s expected to us in health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure of the qualcomm-stiftung that &apos;s called &quot; $ 10 million qualcomm tricorder &apos;s prize . &quot;
we ask teams around the world to connect all these technologies in a mobile phone so that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s an ai ausgerüstet , you can test or test your blutwerte .
and to win , the device must be a better diagnosis as a team of hochqualifizierter doctors .
imagine this device . in a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the krankheitslast and 1.3 percent of the staff of healthcare .
if this device sequenced a rna- or dna-virus , which is not known , it &apos;s ruft it up and prevents a pandemic a pandemic before your outbreak .
but now to the largest force that will lead us to a world of surplus .
i call them &quot; the coming next billion . &quot;
the white lines are the population .
we &apos;ve just überschritten the 7-milliarden-marke .
and by the way , the largest absicherung against a population explosion is a better education and food in the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people online .
until 2020 , we steigen from two to five billion internetnutzer .
three billion new heads we &apos;ve never heard before , the global communication communication .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what will you want ?
and instead of economic relativity , i see one of the greatest economic anschübe of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that will flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier through use of the tricoders , and they &apos;re getting better through the khan-akademie , and by the khan-akademie , and so they &apos;re going to be able to use 3d printer and &quot; infinite computing , &quot; and as much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive productive members of menschengemeinde us ?
how about a set of new , never gehörter voices .
how would it , the oppressed , wherever they are , to give a voice to pay attention to themselves and create change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
how about beiträgen that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned through the x prize is that small teams that are motivated by passion and focus is to create extraordinary things , things that can create the great business and governments in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might already know .
it &apos;s a game that recognizes means .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to evolve .
we can be able to predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medizinforschung .
so so far , this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university professors .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that today , the human pattern is better the proteins better than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who the best protein-ordner in the world , it wasn &apos;t a mit-professor , it was not an mit-professor , but it was not a caltech-student , up to manchester , a woman , a woman who was working as an assistant in a reha-klinik , at night , and at night the best protein-ordnerin in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what i have tremendous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power today than individuals to face the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to the tools with an exponential technology .
we have the passion of a diy-innovatoren .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropen .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work online with the new challenges , and to do what is needed .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to have something against a verändernswertes piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical man , and i am .
and maybe i &apos;ve been long enough in business that i can allow it to give me a piece of my own wrong prestiges to give up this .
but before i get to the actual issue of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the saisonende close and move to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; moneyball is soon , and it turns to statistics about statistics and to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to relate to a statistics that i hope most of you have heard of them .
it &apos;s the durchschnittsleistung of the schlägers .
we talk about a 300 , when a bat is 300 .
that means that the player certainly has three from 10 .
this is called the ball into außenfeld , he &apos;s coming , he &apos;s not going to be caught , and who &apos;s trying to take the ball to the first base , it wasn &apos;t done it in time , and it was in security .
three from 10 .
you know how to call a 300ter baseball in baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a all-star .
you know how to call a 400ter ?
that &apos;s somebody in the rest of the rest of them from 10 .
legendär -- like ted williams - -- the last major baseball player on a regulären baseball player during a regulären season over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine in which i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little less if i &apos;ve talked to you about it .
so suppose you have a blinddarmentzündung , and you &apos;ll get a operateur überwiesen , whose durchschnittsleistung 400 in terms of blinddarmentzündungen .
somehow does not work , right ?
suppose you live in a certain remote area , and you have a beloved people with verstopften herzkranzgefäßen , and your hausarzt überweist this to a kardiologen , whose durchschnittsleistung , whose durchschnittsleistung is about 200 .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better year . it &apos;s on the aufsteigenden branch .
and it &apos;s schlägt .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do they think the durchschnittsleistung for a kardiologen or a nurse or a nurse or a orthopäden , a geburtshelfer , should be a rettungsassistenten ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in the entire medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor or a doctor should be .
but what we do though is that we are all of them , including me , locked out into the world with the claim to be perfect .
never make a mistake , no one makes you feel about the details of how to do this .
and that &apos;s the message i took into medical medical school .
i was a zwanghaft obsessiver student .
in high school , once in a high school , brian goldmann would learn that brian bluttest .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little dachstube in the sisters at the toronto of general hospital , unweit from here .
i learned everything .
in my anatomievorlesung , i learned the origins and the tail every arterie , every arterie of every artery , which goes from the aorta , obskure and ordinary differentialdiagnosen .
i even knew the differentialdiagnose to klassifizieren renale tubuläre .
and the time i &apos;d collected more and more .
and i was good , i closed with cum laude .
and i left the medical school with the impression of that , if i knew everything and everything , or as much as much as possible as possible as possible as possible , as close as possible , i could be immune to the power of mistakes .
and it worked for a time , until i met a printer .
i residierte at a lehrkrankenhaus here in toronto as a woman in toronto as a woman was brought into the notfallabteilung of the hospital .
at that point , i was zugewiesen the kardiologischen layer in kardiologischen service .
and it was my mission to look at the notfallpersonal kardiologischen advice to study the notfallpatienten .
and it &apos;s to give to my oberarzt .
i studied the printer , and she was in atemnot .
and when i listened to her , they made keuchende sounds .
and when i abhörte her chest with the stethoskope , i could hear a knackendes sound on both sides , which told me that she had unter heart failure .
this is a condition in the heart , instead , rather than to pump all of the blood , put a part of the blood in the lung , and it füllt this slowly , so the kurzatmigkeit came up .
and that was not a hard to stellenden .
and i hired her and made me the treatment .
i gave her aspirin . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of hearts .
i gave her medicine that we call diuretics , water , so that she ausschied the liquid .
and over a year and a half hours , they started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my oberarzt .
i didn &apos;t take the links and did what i should have been , what should have been a phone call in my oberarzt to him , so that he would have a chance to make a chance to make a picture .
and he knew it , he was able to have more additional information to their beizusteuern .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the hilfsbedürftige doctor .
and maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take a responsibility that i was like that , and so i would be able to worry for my patients without making him contact .
my second mistake was worse .
so i sent them back to home , i was a quiet voice to say , i was trying to say , &quot; goldman , &quot; no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , it really lacked me that i was so much fehlte that i was going to ask the nurse of the nurse , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and she said , &quot; yeah , i think it will go well . &quot;
i remember that as being yesterday .
so i unterzeichnete the entlassungspapiere and an krankenwagen and rettungsassistenten and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , the night i had this nagende feeling in my stomach .
but i worked on .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my things , come down the hospital , and i went home to drive the car , when i did something i didn &apos;t do .
i went home with my way home .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen ms. printer , but another three words to me , and these three words , most of the notfallärzte i know .
other medical scientists fear that as well , but the notfallmedizin is very special , because we just see the patients in words .
the three words : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients at home ? &quot;
asked the nurse sachlich .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular tonlage .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
about an hour after she came home , after i had sent her home , she kollabierte , and the family , and the rettungsassistenten took them back to the notfallstation with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous schockzustand .
she barely atmete and she was blue .
the notfallpersonal zog all strands .
they gave her blutdruckerhöher .
they schlossen them up .
i was shocked and to the inner zerrüttet .
and i lived through this achterbahn because she came to the intensivstation , and i hoped that she would recover .
and after two , three days was clear that she was never an awakening .
she didn &apos;t have behandelbaren .
their family got together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they created the geschehenen .
on the neuten day , they liesen them -- ms. printer , a mother and grandmother .
you say you don &apos;t forget the names of those versterben .
and that was the first time i learned this .
the next couple of weeks , i realized , and i learned for the first time for the first time , the ungesunde shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , in isolated , not the kind of common shame that you felt because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you know , all of the best shame , if you have a mystery of the best friend , if you get a secret of the best friend &apos;s prize , if you get one of the best , and the best friend , and you have a terrible discussion , if you get a bad discussion , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re never doing a mistake like this .
if you do wiedergutmachung , you never make mistakes .
this is the kind of lehrreicher shame .
the food way that i &apos;m talking about is the one in a innersten .
it &apos;s the one who says that &apos;s not what you &apos;ve done , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t a matter for me , he was very lieb .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was glättete and sure that i would not be a verklagt .
but i asked these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the oberarzt ? why am i going to go home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why am i going to go into medicine ?
but certainly , it legte .
i started feeling better .
and then on a bewölkten day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun came up and i might feel better feel better .
and i felt that if i doubled my efforts to perfection and never again a mistake a mistake that the voice could be verstummen .
and she did .
and i continued to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the notfallstation krankenhaus in a kommunalen hospital north of toronto , and i was a 25 years of alten mann .
it was a lot and i go into a hurry .
he always showed here .
i looked in the rachen , and it was a little bit of pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin , and i sent him on .
and when he went out of the door , he showed up his rachen .
two days later , i came to my next notfalldienst , and my chefärztin asked me to a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : remember ?
&quot; remember the patients with the gereizten ? &quot;
it turns out he was a streptokokken-infektion .
he had a potentially lebensgefährliche disease called epiglottitis .
you can google , but it &apos;s not an infection of the rachens , but the upper atemwege and causes the verschluss .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got intravenöse antibotica , and a few days later .
and i went back by the same tortur of shame and selbstzweifel , felt me and went to work and went back to work again and again .
in a notfallschicht , i have two times a blinddarmentzündung .
there &apos;s a few things that , especially when you think about that you &apos;re working in a hospital that was only 14 patients a night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there would be no mängel in their treatment .
i thought he was nierensteine .
i ordnete the x-ray of the blogosphere . when this was no befund , my colleague , in the bottom of the patient in the bottom of the patient in the bottom of the patient , and called the operateure .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i ordnete fluide to rehydrieren him and asked my colleagues and asked my colleagues .
and he did , and he did a verhärtung in the right of the right sector , he called the operateure .
in both cases , operierte was all of them .
both of them nagten , fraßen me .
and i &apos;d be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but complete nonsense nonsense .
some of my klöpse happened in the last five years .
it &apos;s alone , beschämt and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t close with my mistakes , and you can talk to me if i can tell the little voice that i really did , what really did not find , how can i do it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes , so they don &apos;t commit the same commit ?
if i was in a room -- like now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you talk about the last time you heard about fehlschlag on fehlschlag ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and you might hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about your mistakes .
and if i had a room full of a room with colleagues , and to tell you what i &apos;ve just told you about , i would not get to the end of the second story before it was really uncomfortable , anyone would say a joke , you would go to the subject and forget about the rest .
and in fact , when i knew my colleagues , that a orthopäde in my hospital would have lost someone &apos;s wrong on the wrong , you know , i would have trouble looking at the eyes .
this is the system we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of mistakes .
there &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- the ones who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do that , and the ones that don &apos;t . those who are einschränkt einschränkt , and the people who are einschränkt with bad results and with good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological reaction like antibodies that attack a human .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we have the people who are making mistakes out of medicine , that it remains a safe system .
but there are two problems .
in fact about 20 years of the medical sendungsbewusstseins and the journalism , i had a personal medical study about medical mistakes and wrong treatments to me for one of my first articles , which i &apos;m going to take for the toronto to my show , &quot; white coat , black way , writing .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely unumgänglich .
we &apos;re working in a system in every day , in which one of 10 medikationen is either one wrong or wrong one , in which is entweder , and more more and more and more zahlreicher and more and more and more efficient or tot or dead .
in this state , about 24,000 kanadier are dying of umgänglichen mistakes .
in the united states , put the institute in the number of 100,000 medicine in 100,000 .
both of them are powerful , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as well as we should .
and is the crux .
in a krankenhaussystem in which medical knowledge , all two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
schlafmangel is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake so that we can take a perfect krankheitsverlauf for a patient for a patient .
and then i take the same patients with brustschmerz , make it verschwitzt and give it a slightly alkoholisierten breath breath , and suddenly , the story is durchsetzt with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same trajectory .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of these are fehler .
so , if you take the system , as i was taught , and all the fehlerbehafteten gesundheitsexperten gesundheitsexperten , then nobody left .
and you know the leier about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
i &apos;d say , &quot; well , this is my worst fehler , &quot; i would say , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about your ? &quot; and then let me show up with the microphone to him .
and then they &apos;re going to extend , you know , they came to the head , then look down the head , and they &apos;re getting out and start to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
you want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i &apos;m fabrizierte . &quot;
what they need is an environment that versetzt them in the position .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the doctor is a human , white to your humanity , you know , you &apos;re not proud to make mistakes , but it &apos;s all about learning something from you to learn that it can be passed on .
they share their experience with others .
it supports them when others talk about their mistakes .
and it shows others their mistakes , not about bloßzustellen , but in a liebevollen , unterstützenden way of all of them .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and if that &apos;s like , people make mistakes from time to time .
so , the system has evolved to figure out that we can make a little bit easier to find people , in fact that , in fact , to create the public spaces , which anyone who &apos;s going to make health care , in fact , can actually respond to the potential mistakes and even reward the potential for people like me , and that &apos;s specifically for people like me who should make mistakes and they should be rewarded .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the neu doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
but i &apos;m bedaure , but i &apos;m going to be able to learn out of it for others .
i don &apos;t know what they keep me , but so i can live .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about veränderbare normwerte .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories earlier to use time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was here .
you might think that he blew finken , but that &apos;s not true .
in fact , he gathered fish .
he described one of them as a very common .
it was a zackenbarsch .
to the &apos; 80s , he was in a great style .
now it &apos;s in the red list .
this story , we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
and yet we still come on the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
they &apos;re still describe the broschüren .
what &apos;s happened here ?
the second story is to be a different concept , the veränderbare taillenweite .
because i experienced it when i was in 1971 in 1971 .
i went there , because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad sonnenbrand , and i was convinced that i was really not there .
it was my first sonnenbrand .
as you can see , the voyager of palmen and a couple of them were mangroven .
there was buntbarsche of about 20 inches , schwarzkinnmaulbrüter , a unterart of buntbarsche .
the fischgründe of these buntbarsche were very ertragreich , and the fishermen lived well , and they were good in ghana .
when i returned 27 years later , the fish was geschrumpft on half its size .
you get five centimeters .
they were genetically erdrückt .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the happiness to be there .
so it has changed nothing , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story is about my favorite mittäterschaft in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- rather to the beginning of the &apos; 60s europe -- förderte europe .
fischförderung , ländern countries that began to have a hundred fish , which is a pretty ugly .
and i went on it , and we &apos;ve done it all over the southern südchinesischen ocean and especially in javasee .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know now that it was the cause of the ocean .
90 percent of our fangs were sponges , other animals that are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there on the trümmern , the trümmerhaufen , were korallenriff-fische .
essentially , the bottom of the ocean was deck and became zurückgeworfen .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
within a year , you take a survey , and then you start with the working fishing .
the reason is going to change -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals will be crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t eat , they threw away because they were dead .
once we started one alive .
she wasn &apos;t ertrunken .
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of trümmern is angesammelt by fischern every time if they go into areas where they &apos;re never going to fish .
but it won &apos;t record .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our normwerte in the new level , and we don &apos;t get what was there .
if you put it up , this is what happens .
on the y-axis , a few good things : biodiversity biodiversity , number of orca , the green in the country , the wasservorrat .
the time it changes . it changes , because people are , of course , their actions .
every generation is looking at the images that they start at the beginning of their conscious life , as standard , and will make everything from it .
the difference then will be seen as loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can be a order of changes .
and at the end , they just want to get the erbärmlichen remains .
that &apos;s now weitestgehend our goal .
we want to get things that have disappeared or things that are no longer as they were .
you could think that the problem of people was interested in that when they lived in räuberischen societies , and they were killing animals , and only after a few generations , what they had done .
because obviously , an animal that has been very often , just before it ausstirbt .
so you &apos;re not losing animals .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a great loss .
the time we focus on the big animals , and the ocean are the big fish .
they &apos;re going to be less because we catch them .
over time , there &apos;s little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the normwert .
the question is why people accept this .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was a different .
of course , a lot of people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
you will confirm it , because the evidence , as you are in a previous form , it &apos;s not as you would like to make the evidence .
so , for instance , for example , the report of a kapitäns soundso , who can be genutzt in this area , not being used to be used , or by fischereiwissenschaftlern , because he &apos;s not about scientific .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we &apos;re living in sophisticated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows a huge role that can play a marine reserve .
because in meeresschutzgebiete , we basically think of the past .
we put the past again that people can &apos;t understand , because the normwerte are changing and very low .
so , the people who can see a marine meeresschutzgebiet and benefit from the insight that enables you to zurücksetzen your normwerte .
what about the people who don &apos;t have possible because they have no access -- the people in the middle west ?
here , i think , the art and the movie might be able to fill the gap , and simulations .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago there was grauwale -- 500 years ago .
and the farbtöne and the farbtöne , you may remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were so touched by this -- except from the pocahontas-geschichte , why were you so touched by the bilderwelt ?
because it &apos;s a little bit of wachruft that has been lost in a way .
so , i mean , the only thing i &apos;m going to give you is cameron by cameron , so that he &apos;s dreht under water .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist ostdeutschland , you had to , if you had a typewriter to the government .
they also had to registrieren a piece of beispieltext from this typewriter .
the reason for this : the government could release where a text came from .
found an article with falschem gedankengut , you could track the creator of these thoughts .
and we couldn &apos;t understand in the west , as anyone could do something like this , and how much the speech would be constrained .
in our own countries , we would never do this .
but if you &apos;ve got a new farblaserdrucker of the leading on the top of 2011 , and print a page , this page bright yellow flecke on every page on every page , in a pattern that makes the page clearly on you and make your printer .
this is happening today .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be aufzuregen .
and that was an example , in which our own governments , the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three hauptquellen of the existing online-problemen today .
so let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three hauptgruppen .
there are online-kriminelle .
for instance , for example , this is mr. dimitry golubow .
and the motives of online-kriminellen are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they &apos;re using online-angriffe to make a lot of money , a huge bunch of money .
there are several known cases of online-millionären , multimillionären that make money through attacks .
this is wladimir tsastsin from tartu in estonia .
this is alfred gonzalez .
stephen watts .
björn sundin .
this is matthew anderson , tariq al-daour and so on .
these guys have come online , but they &apos;ve been using it online , but they &apos;ve been using it for example , and they &apos;ve done it from our bankkonten , as we do our online-banking , or keylogger , who have collected our kredikarteninformationen with input on the keyboard as we &apos;ve collected over a infected computer online .
the swiss geheimdienst fror , two months , two months ago , two months ago , this one , and on this account , 14,9 million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain itself is on free feet , the aufenthaltsort is unknown .
and i want to argue that it is more likely to be victims of a online-verbrechens , as a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to be worse .
in the future , most crime are going to play online .
the second second angreifergruppe we see today are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- they &apos;re like , an opinion , or through their audience .
groups like anonymous , over the last 12 months , and they have become one of the hauptspieler on the field of online-angriffe .
so these are the three hauptangriffsgruppen : criminals that are to do the money because of the money , hacktivisten , as anonymous , how anonymous who are able to do it , but the last group are nations , governments who are running the attacks .
that &apos;s where we think about diginotar .
it &apos;s a model that happens when governments governments attack their own citizens .
diginotar is a vollmachtszertifikat from the netherlands -- or it was .
in the last fall , it had to be insolvenz , because diginotar had been hacked .
somebody was hacked and had the system gründlich .
and last week in a meeting with dutch regierungsvertretern , i asked one of the leitenden of this group , whether he was possible for the diginotar-hacks , because of the diginotar-hacks people had died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying ?
diginotar is a zertifizierungsstelle .
they sell zertifikate .
what do you do with zertifikaten ?
now , a certificate is required when you have a website with https , with a ssl-verschlüsselten service , for example .
now we all use this , or a lot of us , or a lot of her business , or a lot of them , and a lot of us , or a lot of her competitors , as iran , which is where they know that they can trust more than local anbietern , and that they are verschlüsselt , so that the local government can &apos;t herumschnüffeln .
can you but if you know , if you &apos;re in a foreign tool .
zertifizierungsbehörde hacken and fake zertifikate .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens by diginotar .
how does it behave with the arab spring and things that are happening in egypt ?
now , in egypt , the aufständischen , in april the headquarters of egyptian , the headquarters , and they found a lot of records .
in this records was a folder called &quot; finfisher . &quot;
and in this folder , notes were a ansässigen in germany , the egyptian government had sold a few programs that they had sold -- in very large grand scale -- all communication of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for 280.000 euros to the egyptian government .
the firmenhauptquartier is right here .
so western governments provide governments with hilfsmitteln , so that they can do it against their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , a couple of weeks ago , a couple of weeks ago , a few weeks ago , this was a trojaner that was used by german regierungsvertretern to bespitzeln their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be in a kriminalfall verdächtigt , you &apos;re pretty much safe with your phone .
but today we are far beyond .
they zapfen their connection connection .
they use tools like the staatstrojaner , to bespielen their computer with a trojaner that allows them to monitor their entire communication , their online-diskussionen abzuhören , to raise their passwörter .
so if we keep thinking about these things , the obvious answer to people would be : &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter to me because i &apos;m a braver citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not a debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between liberty and control .
and as we have today , in 2011 , in 2011 , in 2011 , we don &apos;t like , any right , we &apos;re going to be abgegeben .
and we trust , we &apos;re going to trust one future government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to deal with the next 50 years .
it might seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of betonblocksteinen .
the first betonblocksteine became 1868 and entstammten a simple idea of a simple idea : module out of wine with large measurements that fit .
betonbausteine became very quickly the meistgenutzte baueinheit in the world .
they put us into the ability to build things bigger than us , buildings , bridges , a stone after another .
basically , the betonbaustein has become the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego that came out .
it was called automatically verbindende stone .
and within a few years , lego lego in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on the planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it all possible .
lego has essentially the betonbaustein , the building block of the world , and took a building a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , at the same year , the next revolution was announced the next revolution angekündigt labs , the next building , the next building .
the transistor was a little plastikeinheit that was uns us from a world of static , aufeinandergestapelten building blocks into a world that was interactive .
like the betonblock , the transistor allows us to build much more , more complex together , a stone after another .
but there &apos;s a hauptunterschied : the transistor was only for experts .
and i personally don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time for experts for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea how to do the power of the engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started to develop littlebits .
let me show you how they work .
littlebits are electronic module , which have a specific function .
they &apos;re vorgefertigt , light , ton , engine and sensor .
and the best part is that they connect with magnet together .
so they can &apos;t sit together .
the stones are farbcodiert .
green is an issue , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is wire .
so all you need to do is be a blue and a green one , and you can build very quickly .
you add one blue to a green , and you can make light .
you can put a switch in between , and you made a little dimmer .
take the switch out of a pulsmodul , which is here , einzufügen , and you did a little blinker .
add this buzzer for a extra effect , and they have a lärmmaschine .
i &apos;ll stop that .
beyond the simple , littlebits is actually quite powerful .
instead of doing that , rather than you have to program or löten , you have to be able to program with simple , intuitive gestures .
so , to accelerate the blinken or slow down , you just turn this button , and it makes it faster or slower .
the idea behind littlebits is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to put every single interaction on this world in a gebrauchsfertigen stone .
lights , notes , solarelemente , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve got littlebits to children and see them .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , as you start the electronics that you understand in the everyday world , and you don &apos;t learn in school .
like , for example , it works , or why the doors of the aufzugs offenbleiben , or how an ipod responds to touch .
we &apos;ve also got littlebits .
so , for example , we had no experience with any experience in electronic things that began to play with littlebits as material .
here we see , with filz , paper and water bottles , like geordie ...
a few weeks ago , we got littlebits to risd , and we gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; power what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a bewegungsgesteuerte konfetti-kanone .
but wait , this is really my lieblings-projekt .
it &apos;s a hummer a hummer , the fear in the darkness .
for these nicht-ingenieure , littlebits is another material , electronics just became another material .
and we want to do this material for all available .
so littlebits source is open source .
you can go to the website , all of the designvorlagen and make them yourself .
we want to do the world of the creators , the inventor , encourage the inventor , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
so , pull up and start invent it .
thank you .
