you know , one of the great vernügen in the travel , and one of the great vernügen research is in common with the people who can still remember the alten , which are still in the wind , and you touch them on the rain stones , touch in the bitter leaves leaves of plants .
you know , in the himalayas , in the himalayas , in the himalayas , you know , in the himalayas , you know , in the himalayas of the world , and that , in the himalayas , the way that we &apos;re living in an absolute sense of the world , it &apos;s the notion that we live in an absolute sense , but only as a model of reality , as a consequence of a group of certain possibilities that have our ancestors , even successful successful , chose many generations .
and of course , we all share the same anpassungsnotwendigkeiten .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing children to the world .
we go through initiationsrituale .
we have to deal with the unaufhaltsamen of trennung by death , and so we shouldn &apos;t be surprised to surprise us that we all sing and dance and make art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique aspect of liedes , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the penan in the forests of the forest , or the anden in haiti , or the voodoo-akolythen in the sahara , or the mitten of the sahara , or the mitten in the middle of the sahara , which i &apos;m going to traveled to the desert a month , or even a yak-hirte on the edge of the qomolangma , everest , the gottmutter of the world .
all of those people teach us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of orientierung around earth .
and this is an idea that when you think about it , you can only meet hope .
together , the unzähligen cultures in the world form a web of spirituellem and kulturellem lives that are umhüllt the earth , and for the moment of the earth , is as important as biological lebensnetz that you know as a biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural lebensnetz as a ethnosphäre , as the gesamtsumme of all of the thoughts and dreams , as the gesamtsumme of all the ideas and dreams and intuitions , which has been defined by the human imagination since the early days of consciousness has been defined .
the ethnosphäre is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all that we are , and what we &apos;re doing as an amazing species .
and as the way the biosphere was very removed , this happened with the ethnosphäre -- only with greater speed .
a biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent or more species , because it &apos;s simply not true , and yet , this -- that -- the apokalyptischste szenarium on the area of biological diversity -- hardly what we &apos;re known as an optimistischstes szenarium in the field of cultural diversity .
and the key indicator of this is extinction .
when any of you in this room were born , 6,000 languages were talking about .
now a language is not just the sum of the vokabulars or a series of grammatikregeln .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means to find the physical world &apos;s soul .
every language is like a altbestehender forest of the mind , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of those 6,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , it &apos;s exactly half the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught anymore anymore . that means that if nothing is done , they &apos;re already dead .
what could be more lonely than being umhüllt , one of the most of your people who speak your language , don &apos;t have any way to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or to expect hope ?
and yet , this terrible destiny is actually someone on earth , about all of the two weeks , because of all two weeks , an elderly , and it takes the last silben of an old language to the grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it a better place ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t be a better place to speak , &quot; and i say , &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let this kind of the language of the language .
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
and then you suddenly would see how it would be if you couldn &apos;t talk about your own language .
and so i &apos;d like to take you to a trip in a way through the ethnosphäre , a short trip through the ethnosphäre , to try to understand what is actually lost .
now there are some of us , in a way , that i think , when i say , &quot; different possibilities his , &quot; really different possibilities of his mine .
so , for example , for example , for example , this child in the amazon , the people of the amazon , believe that they mythologisch the milchfluss milchfluss from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
this is a people who is not unterscheidet between the color and green and green , because the forest of the forest that people depend on the forest .
you &apos;ve got a novel language , and you have a heiratsvorschrift the linguistic exogamie , you have to marry someone who talks a different language .
all of this is the wurzelt in the mythologischen past , and that &apos;s the eigenartige of these big houses , where they &apos;re talking about six or seven languages , however , you never hear someone who learns a language .
they just stop and start to speak .
or , one of the most intriguing that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the waorani in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people that was the first time 1958 .
in 1957 , i were trying to draw five missionare , and made a schwerwiegenden mistake .
they warfen glänzende pictures from the air that we would grade as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people in their life had never seen anything in their life .
they took these photographs off the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the character , they found nothing and schlussfolgerten that this is business business of the devil and killing the five missionare with the spear .
but the waorani were killing not only outside with the spear .
they durchbohrten each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened by durchbohrungen .
we followed eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we were doing it with the nachdruck , they gave them something that one of the people who was so old that he died because of his age , and we kept killing him with the spear .
but at the same time , she had a clear knowledge of forest that was amazing .
their predators could smell the tieres of an animal from 40 steps away and determine what the animal animals owned owned .
i was given a really amazing job , when i asked my professor at harvard , if i was interested in going to haiti and the secret to the secret societies , which were the foundation of duvalier and tonton , and the poison that was used to do it to make zombies , to make sure .
so , to give a sense of that , of course , of course , i had to know something about this remarkable belief , and voodoo is not a cult of the black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex kind of metaphysische view .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask you to ask the great world religions , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , buddhismus , or whatever .
a continent is left left out , because the guess is that there was no religious faith in sub-saharan africa , of course , of course , and there was a little bit of these very profound religious thoughts , which is herüberkamen during the tragic diaspora .
but what &apos;s interesting is that this is a living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living giving birth to the spirit .
the minds can become heraufbeschwört from the big water , answers to the rhythm of the living , to be in denial , so the akolyth for a short glänzenden moment to god .
deshab likes to say , &quot; your white goes into the church and you say about god .
we &apos;re going to dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , will you take off the mind . how can you get on damage ?
you see this amazing demonstrations : voodoo-akolythen in a trancezustand , which is an amazing visualization of the ability of mind the ability to influence the body so that this is when it versetzt into a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all the people i &apos;ve met , the kogi aus from the sierra nevada de santa marta in nordkolumbien , the most extraordinary .
nachkommen of the old american civilization that the caribbean of the caribbean of the caribbean , and in a consequence , this people moved into a isoliertes vulkanisches in a isoliertes .
in a blutbefleckten continent , these people were the only ones that were never conquered by the spaniern .
so today , it &apos;s going to be governed by a ritual , which is governed by a ritual , though , though , is very extraordinary .
they were separated at the age of three and four years in the schattenhaften world for 18 years of abgeschottet , and two years of the black world , and two years of abgeschottet , in the fuße world for 18 years , and two periods of neun , to be elected to mimic the nine months of pregnancy that they spent in their lap now in the lap of great mother &apos;s lap .
and during that time , they will introduced culturally to the values of their society , values that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we might say the ecological -- balance .
so , in the end of this amazing , you &apos;ll see a sonnenaufgang , and at the end of the first time , when the sun starts to strahlen , suddenly , everything you &apos;ve learned in the abstract things , and the priest comes back back , and the priest back and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really how i told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call older brothers and saying that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we &apos;re thinking about eingeborene and landscape , we entweder the old wilden , and the old piece of the fancy wild , which is a rassistischer thought , or on the other , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
so , eingeborene are neither sentimental , and they &apos;re noch by the nostalgie .
it doesn &apos;t get a lot of space in the malariaverseuchten or the cold winds of tibet , you know , however , in the cold winden , or the cold winden , in the idee , which is not to be close to be close , but on a weit intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist because it &apos;s in the human mind .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child , in a little child , which is a little child , and it &apos;s a little relationship with this resource , and a different relationship with this resource , or this place , as a small child , as a small child , which is going to believe that a mountain is a bunch of rocks that can become abgetragen .
whether he &apos;s a aufenthaltsort of a mind or a pile of erz , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that is defined the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of britisch colombia and believed that these forests are there to be gerodet .
and this made me to another person as my friends as my friends who believe that these forests of the aufenthaltsort and the gebogenen spirit are , who are living on the nordende of the world , the spirit of the world , who they were involved in their hamatsa-initiation .
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i only put in the amazon of the amazon .
this is ayahuasca , from the many of you have heard of the most powerful preparation from the repertoire of the schamanen .
and what &apos;s fascinating is not just the most powerful potential of these präparats , but the process of this präparats , you know , you know , you know , there &apos;s a lot of these wooden liane , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , there &apos;s a lot of betakarbolinen , harmin , and it &apos;s a little bit as if you put a blue smoke on your consciousness , but it &apos;s going to be the leaves of a strauchs from the family to the name of kaffeepflanzen viridis .
this plant contains a lot of very strong tryptamine to the serotonin , dimethyltryptamin-5 and methoxydimethyltryptamin are very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the yanomami , as you see this stuff , this substance substance , this substance that you &apos;re making out of various species as well .
so this powder is to be a powder shot in a gewehrlauf shot , gesäumt by barocken &apos;s paintings , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to create verzerrung of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even with my professor , richard evan shultes , the man who eingeleitet the psychedelische with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the 30iger years , and i said that you couldn &apos;t put it as a halluzinogen , because at the moment that you feel the effects that you &apos;re not there anymore to experience a halluzination .
but the thing about tryptaminen is that they can &apos;t be taken down , because of one in the human gut , of course , vorkommendes enzyme called monoamin-oxidase enzym , denaturiert denaturiert .
they can only be taken together with some other chemicals that mao denaturieren .
now , what &apos;s fascinating is that the betakarboline that are in the liane that are in the middle of the way that are necessary , which is the kind of notwendig to potenzieren . so you ask yourself .
how can these people come out of an flora species of adstringierender plants that are not going to find the plants in the plants , if you put in this way , you can create a kind of biochemischer version , so that the whole greater than the sum of its parts is ?
we use this great euphemism , trying to try and make mistakes as meaningless .
but you ask the indians americans say , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the cofan , have 17 varieties of ayahuasca that you can see in a forest distance in the forest that are in our eyes as a way .
and then you ask them how they put their taxonomie , and they say , &quot; i thought you know , some of the plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so it turns out that you take each of the 17 varieties in vollmond , and you &apos;re singing to one in a different tonlage .
now , that doesn &apos;t bring you a ph.d. in harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count .
now , the problem is the problem that even those of us who have to have the sympathy for the difficult position of americans , they have been able to be able to look at the past the past , while the real world , that means our world .
so , the fact is that you &apos;ll remember the 20th century in 300 years , but rather than an era of an era where we were present and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on the planet either active or passive , and the problem is not the change .
all cultures have involved in the dance with new lebenmöglichkeiten .
and the problem is not the technology .
the sioux-indianer were listening to be less to the sioux when they bogen and arrow , than americans americans stopped to be americans when they stopped to be americans , when they stopped the horse and pferdewagen tasks .
not change and technology is the integrity of ethnosphäre , and it &apos;s power . that &apos;s the ugly face .
and as you know , in the world , you can see that these cultures are nicht , and you know , you know , you can see that these cultures are bereit in the forest of the forest , from sarawak , a people who are willing to see their schiffsräume on the horizon , they are willing to see , they are willing to fill out of the forest that they have the forest , or like in the case of the yanomami , where they were krankheitsträger , they have been verdrängt during the goldrauschs .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet , where i have a lot of work , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the genocide , the phyische extinction of people become convicted in general , but the ethnozid , the destruction of people &apos;s lives , isn &apos;t just not verurteilt , but generally , and vielerorts as part of a entwicklungsstrategie .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering , if you don &apos;t have seen it on unterster level .
i was a young colleagues 6,000 6,000 miles from chengdu to lhasa , and only when i came to see the face behind the statistics that you know , 6,000 of holy monuments that were turned into schutt and asche , 1.2 million people who were killed during the cultural revolution .
and the father of this young boy was identifiziert as the followers .
and that meant he was killed during the chinese invasion immediately .
his uncle floh , with their holiness , in the diaspora , brought people to nepal .
his mother became locked as punishment punishment for a punishment for the crime .
he was in the age of two years old in the prison to hide under her rockzipfel , because she couldn &apos;t live with him .
the sister who was beging this brave , was brought into a erziehungslager .
one day she came up to a armband , and for this übertretung , she had to work for seven years into a tough camp camp .
it can be unerträglich unerträglich , but the erlösende spirit of people &apos;s minds .
and at the end , we really want to be a choice . do we want to live in a monochromatischen world in the world &apos;s world , or in a polychromatischen world &apos;s world ?
margaret mead said , the great anthropologist said that , as we get towards a thread , that gestaltlosen , gestaltlosen view , we can move down the whole range of human imagination in the human mindset , but that we had to wake up one day from a dream and forget that there &apos;s ever been any other possibilities .
and it &apos;s very humbling to think that our species may exist for 600,000 years .
the neolithische revolution that brought us into agriculture , and , in this moment , in this moment , is the poetry of the schamanen , the poetry of the priesterschaft and a hierarchy , created , created specialization and surplus -- found only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is almost 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges that we have in the next millennia .
if we &apos;re going to ask these unzähligen weltkulturen after the importance of human questions , they answer 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;ll be able to wiederentdecken the possibility of what we are : people with full consciousness , which are aware that all of the people and gardens have gardens to flourish , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took in the northern nördlichen of the baffin-inseln , when i went to inuits on the narwhal-jagd , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the 50iger years in the 50iger , they were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather was refused .
the family , the fear of his life had all the guns and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit are not afraid of the cold . they use them to their advantage .
the gleitschienen of their schlitten were originally made out of fish in karibu-haut .
the man &apos;s grandfather didn &apos;t care about the arctic night or the wehenden storm .
he schlüpfte out , and he made his pants out of seehundsfell and defäkierte into his hand , and when the human waste began to market , he formed it into the form of a messers .
he speichel on the sides of the fäkalien-messers , and when it was completely frozen , he erstach a dog .
he enthäutete the dog and improvisierte a geschirr geschirr , and he took a geschirr the dog &apos;s skeleton , and a schlitten , spannte , another dog , and entschwand over the eisschollen with the fäkalien-messer .
that &apos;s what you can do .
and this is a symbol of many ways in many ways of the resistance of the inuit , and all of muslims in the world .
the canadian government gave the entire total control of the entire control of the total control , which is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country country and called nunavut .
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control mineralvorkommen .
so an amazing example , like a nation , like a nation , a state of people who are looking for his people .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who traveled to these distant aim of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not even away .
they &apos;re the heimatländer of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that zurückreichen in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children will become part of the geography of hope .
what we end at national geographic eventually is that we think politicians will never achieve something .
we believe that polemik -- we believe that polemik is not convincing , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website gets 35 million hits every month .
visually nations send our fernsehkanal .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we &apos;re going to take a series of trips to those cultural wonder , that we &apos;re blind to the center of these cultural wonder , and i hope that this world has deserves it to exist in different ways that we can find a lebensmöglichkeit in a really multicultural pluralistischen world where the wisdom of all humans can contribute to our collective well-being .
thank you .
what i &apos;m first going to tell you about is the basic work , a new technology that we &apos;ve done as a year of a year ago , and that &apos;s seadragon , and it &apos;s an environment where it &apos;s either local or removed with enormous amounts of visual data .
we see many , a lot of books on digital photos here that you can nahtlos and continuously heranholen , schwenken , in a new way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the kongressbibliothek , and it &apos;s a scan of 300 megapixeln .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference , because the only thing that can make the performance of a system like this , is the number of pixels on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of nichtbild-daten .
this is bleak &apos;s house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not to be a picture , we can do something like that , to really show that this is a real representation of texts and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a e-buch .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a realistischerer case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a abschnitts .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a newspaper or reading a newspaper , which is a sort of a form of scale .
and we also did something on the corner of this particular guardian .
we designed a false resolution with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical inventors .
and this actually reaches these ideas to stop the limitations for the place on the screen .
we hope that this is not a pop-ups and other nonsense of it means that it shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , this is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re going to contribute to this domain .
but these are all streets in the united states .
on the top of the erdräumlichen picture of nasa .
now let &apos;s get something else .
this is even live in the internet . you can nachprüfen it .
this is a project called photosynth , which is really two different technologies together .
one is seadragon , and the other is a very good research on computervision , which is a universitätsstudenten in the university of the university of the university of washington seitz at the uw .
and rick szeliski has been done by microsoft research . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by seadragon .
you can see that if we can create these kinds of views , where we can go through images , and make this experience of mehrfachen resolution resolution .
but the spatial orientation of the images is actually meaning .
and they put these pictures together with their real space , and they put them into the real room , in which they have been taken in the echten lakes in the canadian rockies , like . you see , you can see elements of stabilisierten slides , or panoramischer , and these things have become all of the time in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly whether i have time to show you other environments .
there are the ones that are much more räumlicher .
and i &apos;d like to show one of the most originalen datensätze of noah , and that &apos;s from a early set of photosynth that we &apos;ve been working in the summer of the technology , which is photosynth-technologie . and this is not so obvious , so obvious , when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to make us care about the lawyers .
and this is a rekonstruktion of the cathedral of flickr , and just give you the images in flickr , and you &apos;ll just give you pictures of men in t-shirts t-shirts and on the universitätsgelände and on the universitätsgelände , each one of these orange is represented by a picture that was discovered as to this model .
so this is all flickr-bilder , and they &apos;re all standing in terms of it with each other .
and we can navigate in these very simple ways .
you know , i never believed that i will eventually work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for a reception here .
and i guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : everything is , from the handy-kamera to professional slrs , a pretty large number of them that were all zusammengeflickt in this environment .
and if you can , i &apos;ll find some of the weird .
many of them are verdeckt verdeckt on faces .
there &apos;s a series of photographs here -- here you are .
this is actually a poster by notre lady who &apos;s been recorded properly .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with social environments . it &apos;s going to be collected data from everybody -- from all of the collective memory , like , visual the earth -- and everything is connected .
all of these photographs are connected , and there &apos;s something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of the entire earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen lawlers on virtual earth .
and this is something that &apos;s through the complexity that people use it , growing and whose use for the user is always getting bigger .
their own photographs will be given up with the metadaten that another person who took another person .
in fact , if someone &apos;s hard and teaches all of all of all of these books , and you , you know , and you can use you , and i can use them as a place to dive into this room , into these metaverse , to use the photos of other people , and use of other people &apos;s worth of social experience with the use of others .
and of course , nebenprodukt of all of it is the immense virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that were not only made by überflüge or satellite images and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
right ? your software enables you to think that at a certain point , in the next few years , all images that are used in the world together in principle ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t do anything else .
if you want to hyperlinks them down between the images .
and she &apos;s doing this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think of the semantischen information that has many of these pictures .
how if you do a websuche for images , where you put a sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about it , which is image .
but what about the picture you connect with all your pictures ?
then the amount of semantischen querverbindung and the abundance that makes it out of it is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic netzwerkeffekt .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . very congratulations .
thank you very much .
so i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , which i hope with other things that you &apos;ve already heard about , and i &apos;m going to try and make myself some connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed these .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official dogma . &quot;
the official dogma of what ?
the official glaubenssatz of all the western societies .
the official dogma dogma works : if our goal is to maximize the good of our citizens , it &apos;s all about the maximierung of the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom is good , valuable , makes sense of sense of the human premise .
if people have freedom , each one of us are all about themselves to do the things that we can maximize our public , and no one has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom you have , and the more freedom you have , the more public you have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , that no one in the mind would get to question it .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what enables us modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big one .
i just want to just say a little bit about salatdressing .
there &apos;s 175 dressings in my supermarket , if you couldn &apos;t buy the 10 of them , and 12 balsamico-essig you could buy a large number of your salat , in the unlikely case , in the unlikely case , that none of the death in the store is right .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then you go to the verbraucher-elektronik business store for a stereo -- speaker , cd-player , ein , verstärker , verstärker , verstärker , and in this one electronics , there &apos;s so many stereo facilities .
we can put 6.5 million different stereo of these components of these components that are offered in a business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , when i was able to have any phone on every phone , as long as he had a boy .
you rented your phone . you haven &apos;t bought it .
so a consequence of that was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we have almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is in the middle -- mp3-player- , nasen-haar-trimmer and crème fackel .
and if you haven &apos;t seen this until now in your business , you can be sure that you &apos;ll be soon .
and what it does is it makes people walk into business and make this question .
now you know what the answer to this question ?
the answer is no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that &apos;s not too much .
in other aspects of life , which are very much more likely to buy objects , the same explosion of choice is true .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer in the united states in the united states , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , she &apos;s going to go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you : we could make a , or we could do b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
a doctor says , a has these benefits and risks and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
and the result is -- we call patients , &quot; patients , &quot; patients &quot; patients , &quot; patients &quot; patients &quot; patients &quot; patients . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but that &apos;s a shift of the burden of decisions about someone who knows -- the doctor &apos;s choice -- to someone who &apos;s not known and most likely to be sick , and therefore not the best constitution is to make a decision -- namentlich the patient .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for verschreibungspflichtige drugs as you and me , that if you think about it doesn &apos;t make sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they advertise us when we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you expect us to call up the doctor &apos;s next morning , and ask a change in a change .
something like our identity is now a question of the choice of what this slide is supposed to show .
we don &apos;t get identity ; we invent them .
and we &apos;re very neu as often as we want .
that means that every day when you wake up the morning , you need to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where it was that almost everybody had one and that they were as fast as quickly as they could , and then they had kids as they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
today , it &apos;s all easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i did earlier .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re very carefully .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re busy with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i get married now ?
should i get married later ? should i get kids , or just a career ? &quot;
these are all einnehmende questions .
and they will answer these questions , whether that means to make all of the tasks that i &apos;m going to do , and not get a good grade in my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to beantwortende questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl shows , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every single day on the planet -- to the randolph hotel .
there &apos;s a corner of the way , by the way i &apos;m not going to tell no what &apos;s going to work on .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions , again and again , and again , whether we should be working or not working .
we can watch our kids playing football games , and we have our mobile phone on the one hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and we probably have our laptop on our lap .
and even if you get off , every minute , every minute , in our child , in the verstümmeln of a fußballspiels , we ask ourselves , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i answer that email email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even when the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to shape their experience of the child &apos;s experience very differently than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world we were living in .
and i want to say there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world that we are now looking at now .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about that , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , paradoxer , is that he &apos;s lähmt instead of free .
with so many options you can choose , it &apos;s very hard to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another more drastisches example of this , for a study of investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to investitions-akten access from vanguard , the giant fondgesellschaft of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 investmentfonds of the employer , took part of participation , took participation .
they offer 50 percent of them -- 10 percent less employees than if they were only five offer . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investmentfonds that are zur , it &apos;s so hard to decide which you want to choose it in tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , , of course , it never comes tomorrow .
you understand that this is not just to say that the people food food , if you don &apos;t have enough money , because they don &apos;t have enough money , it means that it &apos;s so hard to make decisions so hard to miss a lot of your employer .
they don &apos;t spend participation to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the arbeitsgeber who would have been happy to reproduce their contributions .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes the world like this .
you really want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the falschen investment investment , or even the wrong salatdressing .
so this is an effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end less content with the result of choice , as if we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
and one of them is that , in fact , in a lot of them , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and it &apos;s not perfect -- it &apos;s just perfect , you know , you know , that they have a different decision , and what &apos;s happening is that they have the decision that they make , and they regret the decision , and that regret works negative to the satisfaction that they had made of their long decision , even when it was a good decision .
the more possibilities there is , the easier thing is , it &apos;s the easier to regret , that &apos;s enttäuschend for the choice they meet .
secondly , what economists call oppertunitätskosten .
dan gilbert made a great point of this morning by telling how much the way we evaluate things about what we compare it .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternative to remember , it &apos;s just attractive properties , you know , it &apos;s just attractive to imagine alternatives that you &apos;re zufrieden , which makes you less happy with the alternatives that you chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who aren &apos;t new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . they have everything for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; damn man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august august .
everybody in my manhattener neighborhood is gone .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thought , which he had missed the opportunity to have a great parking lot of parking day .
oppertunitätskosten increases the happiness that we get through our choices , even though what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more possibilities there are choices , the more attractive properties of these choices are going to account in the oppertunitätskosten .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon is a couple of aussagen .
he &apos;s making a statement about it in now , and maybe it &apos;s starting to do things .
but one more important thing that he &apos;s doing is , who he is trying to decide who they don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things like a lot of attractive qualities , and it &apos;s going to do what they &apos;re going to do less powerful .
third : eskalation of expectations .
and this hit me when i was talking about jeans jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time when there was a kind of time , and they bought them , and they were bad gepasst , and they were incredibly unkomfortabel , and if they had a long time , and they have washed enough , they have gotten enough , they &apos;ve got &quot; ok . &quot;
so to buy new jeans after many years , to buy new jeans , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesmen said , &quot; do you want schlanke , slightly anliegende or weite ?
do you want the buttons or reißverschluss ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
if you cut down the bottom , blah , blah , blah blah , blah blah , blah , blah , blah , blah . &quot; and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way that the only was the one . &quot;
he had no idea what it was , so i spent an hour of all this damn jeans anzuprobieren , and the store -- and i &apos;m saying the truth -- with the best jeans i &apos;ve ever had .
i had better . all of these choices allowed me to have it better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it to myself .
and the reason that i was feeling worse , with all these possibilities , my expectations for what a good number of jeans are , went up .
i had a very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when it was in a way .
when you came to 100 species , you know , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i was going to get to what i was expecting , and what i had was enttäuschend in comparison to what i expected .
the adding opportunities in the lives of people &apos;s lives increases the expectations of people who are going to be about how good those people are going to be .
and this leads to less satisfaction with the results , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of marketings knows that , because if you would , you wouldn &apos;t know what it is about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that it used to be better than anything worse when it was worse when it was worse for people , it was possible for people who have a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world we live in the world -- we are wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation , the best thing you can ever hope is things as well as well as you expect .
they will never pleasant because their expectations expectations , my expectations .
the secret to the glücklichkeit -- that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all got -- the secret to the glücklichkeit are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short autobiographischer moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t have niedergelassen .
but niederlassen is not always a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of a bad one , when there &apos;s just a way to buy a way to buy , if you are dissatisfied , and you ask yourself why , who is responsible in the answer , the world is responsible . what would they have done ?
when hundreds of different kinds of thousands of jeans jeans are available , and they buy one that &apos;s made , and ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : you .
they could have done better .
with 100 different types of jeans in schaufenster , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions , and even though the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it , they &apos;re beschuldigen themselves .
clinical depression exploded to the industrial world in the last generation .
i believe a signifikanter -- not the only one , but a signifikanter beiträger of the depression , is that people were enttäuschend , because their standards are so high , and then if you have to explain these experiences themselves , it would be your fault .
and so the bilanzergebnis is that it &apos;s going on , generally better , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dogma , which is one we all think of , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s a little bit better than no , but it doesn &apos;t follow that it &apos;s more choices than something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time on the choice of choice .
now , as an economic question -- i &apos;m almost done -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as an grundsatz question , which is a thing about to think about that , which is what all this choice allows in the industrialized societies , is wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them , whose problem is not too much choice .
your problem is that you have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry is , steve levitt is told you about how these more expensive and heavy car seats don &apos;t help installierenden car seats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that this expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
they even hurt .
it &apos;s what we &apos;re getting worse .
if something from what the people of our society enables us to make so much choices in the societies in people that people would get too few choices , wouldn &apos;t only improve the life of people , but it would also be improved .
economists call this a pareto-verbesserungs application .
it &apos;s going to worry about everyone else -- not just the poor -- because all these big choices are plagt us .
by closing , read this cartoon cartoon , please read this cartoon cartoon , and a sophisticated person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this goldfischglas . &quot;
verarmten imagination , a kurzsichtige view of the world -- and that is the way i read it first .
and the more i thought about it , the more i think i got to see the fish .
because the truth is that , when you break it , so everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the goldfischglas , so everything is possible , you reduce happiness .
it increases paralysis and senken .
everybody needs a goldfischglas .
this is too limited with complete security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the abhanden is going to be a recipe of goldfischglas , is a recipe for misery , and i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome , and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we have digitized biology and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by creating new lives and build new lives .
we &apos;ve always been trying to ask significant questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i believe that many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we have a different approach to try to simplify it to the minimal components .
we &apos;ve digitized about 20 years . when we sequenced the humangenom , the shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now , we &apos;re trying to ask if we can live life or whether we can make new lives , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma geitalium , which is the smallest genome of a species in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to replicate whether we can do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it for about a hundred hundred genes from the 500 or so that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our trust , and trust it &apos;s simple , but if we look at all these genes , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way in the front of this chromosome is actually to synthetisieren this chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components and ask some of the fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we synthetisieren a chromosome ?
does it allow the chemistry to make these really large molecules , what hasn &apos;t been done before ?
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
one chromosome is , by the way , just a piece of inertes chemical material .
our steps in the digitalisierung of life were exponentially .
so , our ability to write genetic code has evolved very slowly , and yet our last point would be on an exponential curve .
we started 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years ago with a bioethischen review before we did the first experiments .
as it turns out , it turns out to be very hard .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world to create the little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a degenerativer process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new method that we were able to put these little bits together and correct the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
we made little bits of pieces , and made a dna molecule , and had a dna molecule about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came , when we took this piece of inerte chemical and put into a bacterium , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code and made viral particles .
and then the viral particles were opened by the cells and came back from the cells .
i was talking about the oil industry recently , and they said they were going to understand this model .
they were laughing more than her .
so we think that this is actually a situation in the software that actually can build your hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole bakterielles chromosome chromosome , and so we thought we &apos;re building it on the größe of the size of the virus that we could vary the size of the kassetten to understand what the individual components are a living cell .
design is key , and if you &apos;re starting to start with digital information on the computer , that digital information needs to be really accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the fehlerrate was at a fehler of 10,000 .
and what we found in the resequenzieren 30 mistakes . if we had used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is it &apos;s to create pieces of the design for 50 letters to make the 50 letters long , and we have to overlap with other 50-buchstaben bits to make smaller sub-einheiten to build these fit .
we &apos;ve got unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have built into waterzeichen .
think about it : we have a 4-buchstaben code code : a , c , g and t.
so these letters -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
at first we got signed up .
some people were disappointed that it was no poetry .
we &apos;ve made the pieces so that we could just put them apart with enzymes , and there are enzymes that are able to fix them and join them .
and we started to create pieces , starting to put the five to siebentausend letters , would lay those together in order to put them together in order to put them together , to 72.000 .
in each way , we &apos;ve made these pieces in the surplus that we could put them , because we were trying to create a very robust process , what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of automation .
so , this looks like a basketball-playoff .
if we get to these big bits -- over 100,000 basenpaaren -- then they &apos;re not going to grow up in e. coli , and it &apos;s beyond the possibility of modern molecular molecular molecular biology , and so we used other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of homologe rekombination , which is using biology to repair dna that can join the dna .
here &apos;s an example of that . there &apos;s an organism called deinococcus radiodurans of the three million rads of radiation .
you can see in the upper field that his chromosome just falls apart .
12 until 24 hours later , everything again , again , again , wie .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely ausgetrocknet , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that live in space and can move on , looking for aquatischen conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot out there .
here &apos;s a gefügeaufnahme of the molecule that we &apos;ve created by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve only used hefe-mechanismen using the right design of the pieces , we have them eingepasst . yeast yeast adds them together automatically .
this is not a elektronenmikroskopaufnahme mikroskopaufnahme .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see with the lichtmikroskop .
these are images of a duration of six seconds .
this is the paper that we &apos;ve only done recently .
this is about 580.000 letters in the code . it &apos;s the largest molecule molecule that has ever been created by people .
it has a molekulargewicht of over 300 million .
if we would print it with a schriftgröße of 10 and without distances , it would be 142 pages , just about this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple , with a virus virus , it &apos;s a lot more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier when you &apos;re in eukaryonten how we &apos;re doing it : you just take the nucleus out and there &apos;s another in it , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about cloning .
in archaebakterien , the chromosome is actually embedded in the cell , but just recently we showed that you can do a full scan of a chromosome from a cell to another , and can activate it .
now , in fact , we gave the chromosome of a mikrobenspezies , and so , roughly said , in grob , in which we could choose this chromosome , and we had some extra-gene to destroy all of the proteins , and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell -- and you &apos;ll estimate our very ausgereiften graphs here .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that here &apos;s the end , but we &apos;ve tried to bring a little further .
this is the hauptmechanismus of evolution here .
we can find all kinds of species of species that have a second chromosome , or a third of irgendwoher , every single time of thousands of characteristics in a second to a species .
so people who think about evolution as a gene that has been changed at a lot of biology .
there are enzymes that are called the restriktionsenzyme that actually digest dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no one ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve added .
it was exprimiert in the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we just had a cell with a new chromosome .
it verfärbte blue because of the genes we put on .
and after a very short time , it had all the characteristics of the species lost in a new species of a new species of the new software that we have given into the cell .
all of the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we go .
it may sound like genomische alchimie , but we can , by changing the software-dna , things quite dramatic .
now i argued that this is not the genesis -- this is based on 3.5 billion years .
and i said that we may be able to create a new form of the kambrischen explosion where it could be massive new artenbildung based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s quite obvious in terms of what we need .
we are in the next 40 years to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context : i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet has existed for each year , within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 30-plus billion barrels of oil ; that &apos;s a hundred million barrels a day .
if we think about biological processes or some process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s the entire co2 ends up in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries from the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the designkomponenten of the future .
the elektronikindustrie had a dozen components , and you see the diversity that came out of it .
we are in the first line of the limitations of biological reality , and in those of our imagination .
we &apos;ve got technologies today because of this fast synthesemethoden to do what we call kombinatorische genetics .
now , we have the opportunity to build a large robot the millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes , or to optimize these processes , or to optimize these processes , or drugs , we can change new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just nurmale selection , and we can go to lebensfähigkeit , production of chemicals or treibstoffproduktion , and so on .
this is a shot of actual design-software design-software that we &apos;re working on where you &apos;re actually sitting down and new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it is going to look , we know exactly how the genetic code is going to be .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation .
you &apos;ve seen corn to ethanol recently , which is just a bad experiment .
we have fuel from the zweiten- and third generation that are going to come out the much higher zuckerwertigkeiten , like oktan or different types of butanol .
but , as we think , the only way that biology is a huge impact without the cost of the cost of their own food or the limitation of their availability , when we look at co2 systems , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that are going to go to this path .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first with treibstoffen the fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 is a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organism we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about ein-einhalb miles , in almost kochenden wassertemperaturen .
it is turning co2 in methane to use hydrogen as a source of energy .
we &apos;re studying whether we can use carbon footprint that could just be brought into produktionsplätzen , which could be made the co2 co2 in fuel to drive this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- moderate targets like the ersatz industry , right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? a hauptquelle of energy .
but in the same way , we &apos;re currently working on trying to use the same approaches for vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back , and you have a dollar in the back of the vaccine .
i think that this can be changed by man vaccines vaccines &apos;s vaccines .
that &apos;s how the future might be able to look at what the future can be accelerating today with synthetic bacteria , archaen , potentially , and potentially .
we are getting light years away from improving people . our goal is that we have a chance of survival for a long time to do that . thank you very much .
at the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to tell you how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far , and for all those who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that has ever been addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that were less than a milliardstel second of the universe in the universe -- and it &apos;s to 600 million times in a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine below geneva .
we &apos;re taking images of these mini-urknalle in detectors .
this is what i work on . it &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 meters in diameter , 22 feet .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction that you see the scale .
at september last year , the machine ran for the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it caused huge huge jubel in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first strahlenpartikels that the lhc , which the lhc , using a part of the lhc , to make some of the lhc , to make particles on the detector on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this image on the 10th of september , we knew that the machine works , which is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this erzeugte the biggest jubel , or this , when someone went to google side , and i found the front page .
it means we reached a cultural impact next to the scientific impact .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires here -- the golden wires here .
these wires lead 13-tausend when the machine runs on hochleistung .
now , the engineers among you will look at you and say , &quot; no , don &apos;t do that . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you cool them down very far , you become something called supraleitern .
so , by minus 271 degrees , cooler than the stars between stars , those wires can be wires the tension .
in one of the connections , between neuntausend magnet in the lhc , there was a manufakturdefekt .
it erhitzen up the wires and 13-tausend ampere , and all of a sudden widerstand resistance .
this was the result .
well , this is a wonderful thing , if you imagine that the magnet over 20 tons and move around about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we did .
we konditionierten them , reparierten them .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
at the end of march , the lhc will be funktionsfähig .
we &apos;re going to turn it up , wait first data in june june or july , and we continue to figure out our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , in a way , these accidents are sort of the value for the value of science and ingenieurskunst in such borders . it &apos;s easy to reject .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we &apos;re reaching beyond our limitations , forms the value of things like the lhc .
so , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind , &quot; and humphrey davy , who said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human spirit , &quot; to assume that our scientific beliefs is that there is no mystery in nature that our triumphe are vollzählig , and there &apos;s no new worlds . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my profession , but it &apos;s of course more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
however , recent things that has been in my life , and my career that has led me to rethink my relationship with this work completely .
now , i &apos;ve been writing a book , recently , i wrote a book called „ eat , pray , love -- that , unlike all of my previous books for some of the previous books in the world , and a big mega-ereignis , the international bestseller-ding .
the result is that i don &apos;t matter where i am , i &apos;ll be treated as the fall of the fall .
seriously -- the demise of geweiht !
so , for example , they come to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t they fear that they &apos;ll never be übertreffen that success ?
don &apos;t they worry that they weiterschreiben their whole life , and never make a book that was interested in the world ? never again ?
okay , that really makes courage .
but it &apos;s worse , if i didn &apos;t remember that , over 20 years ago , when i was a teenager for the first time i told it , that i wanted to be faced with the same kind of angstbesetzter response .
people said , do you have no fear , never have succeeded ?
don &apos;t you fear that the humiliation of a absage kills you ?
don &apos;t you fear that you have a nachgehst of life for your life , and you never create something that you can die , and you can be dying , you &apos;re dying -- your mouth filled with the bitter asche of failure ?
so , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : „ yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had .
and i was a lot more things that no one would be able to do .
like algae -- and other people &apos;s things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about this for recently , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it clear that someone should be expected to do the work that he &apos;s going to do ?
and what is going on with the creative device that they make us insecure about the mutual health state -- in a way that they don &apos;t do other professions ?
my father , for example , was chemist and i can remember no situation in his 40 years as a chemist when he was asked if he was afraid to be a chemist .
with your chemiker-blockade , john -- how do you go ?
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not received the ruf of alkoholsüchtigen people .
we have writers seem to have this kind of reputation , but not just the writers , but not only the kreativen , they seem to have this reputation , mentally incredibly unstable .
all you have to do is to look at the bitter todeszahlen of really great minds by the 20th century that died young and often by their own hand .
and even those who didn &apos;t actually own suizid , they seemed really neglected from their talent .
norman mailer said a moment before his death in his last interview : „ each of my books has a little further .
it &apos;s a extraordinary statement that you can do about your lebenswerk .
but we don &apos;t even know if we heard somebody like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with that this kind of , because we &apos;ve seen the perception of this long time , and collectively , that creativity and suffering kind of , of course , of course , and that art -- at the end -- always leads to the seelenqual .
the question i want to ask everyone here today is : is this idea for you ?
do you feel that ? because with only one centimeter one centimeter , i don &apos;t even feel about this notion .
i find them abscheulich .
and i find them dangerous , and i don &apos;t see how she &apos;s taken over into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we encourage our big creative creative .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start to start this dark , this dark path of view -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career in my career .
that means -- you see , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 arbeitsjahre in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to be writing from the world as the work is , which is what &apos;s going on , after the abgefahrenen success of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m going to say it , because we &apos;re all kind of friends -- it &apos;s highly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thought that you can get someone to go to the nine o &apos;clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want that .
i would continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
now , after some time , it seems to me that i could continue to write a kind of schützendem psychological construct .
and somehow i have to find a way to write a safe distance in writing a safe distance between me and my very natural beklemmung of how the reaction is going to be writing .
i &apos;ve been looking for models for models last year , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they might be better or vernünftigere ideas about how to help , with the emotional risks that are connected to creativity .
this is what it led me to greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but in the ancient greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity is coming , okay ?
they believed that creativity was kind of a kind of göttlicher diener-geist , who was from a distant , unknown source to the people -- from unerklärlichen , unknown reasons .
the greeks called the divine diener-geister of creativity of creativity .
socrates &apos;s known by socrates , he thought he had thought he had a dämon , he would have a weisheiten from him .
and the same idea was the same idea , called this kind of körperlosem creative mind a „ genius .
that &apos;s great . the roman didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of genius , this kind of kind of a magic , which was believed that it &apos;s literally living in the walls in the walls -- roughly like dobby , the hauself -- and the artist , and the artist in some sort of unsichtbar invisible and gestalten the outcome .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from your work .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artist &apos;s artists was protected in certain ways , like , for example , for example , for example , right ?
if your work brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew that you had this körperlose genius that helped you .
if your work floppte -- not completely your fault , right ?
everybody knew your genius was lahm .
that &apos;s how people in the west was thinking about creativity .
and then the renaissance came . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- all of the gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no room for the mystic creatures that are taking orders from divinity .
and it &apos;s the beginning of rational , and people began to believe that creativity completely came from its own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people that or artists to call a genius -- instead of that he has a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think , or it &apos;s like the gefäß , and the essence and the essence and the essence of the divine , creative , unbekanntem , infinite mysteriums is a little too much to have a lot of responsibility to a fragilen , human psyche .
it &apos;s like asking someone to eat the sun .
the entstellt and distorted whole way , and it creates all of these unerreichbaren expectations of success .
i think that this erfolgs-druck has been vernichtet our artists for the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to return to a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just auslöschen rational humanismus for 500 years in a 18-minütigen talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience that really berechtigte würden about the idea of the idea of -- basically -- feen , the people nachfolgen and feenzauber on their projects and so on .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question that i want to say is why not ?
why don &apos;t that think ?
because it makes a lot of sense like everything that i heard about when it was to explain the absolute verrückt of the creative process .
a process that -- as everybody knows that has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everybody here -- not always verhält .
in fact , he can feel really geradezu .
now , i had a close encounter of this , when i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , and she told me that when she was growing up in the southern virginia virginia in virginia , and she said she would feel and hear like a poem about the landscape on them .
she would be like a donnernder train out of air .
that &apos;s where it was on the country .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet .
she knew that she could just do one moment , and that was -- in their words -- in their words -- „ running like the devil .
she ran like the devil to the house . it was the only thing that they had to get quickly enough to get a sheet of paper and a pen , so they had to get it , when it was through them through them , capture and to capture on the sheet .
she wasn &apos;t fast enough , but she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t tell the poem , but she would miss it , and she missed it . she said it was going to move over land and -- as she said -- „ after another poet .
and then there were these moments -- the part i &apos;ll never forget -- she said that there were moments in which they almost missed it .
so , she &apos;s running for the house and the poem , and the poem , and she takes a pen through them and she picks up a pen , and then she said , and then she said -- she was like , she was going to reach with her other hand and put it in .
she caught the poem on his tail , and he pulled it back into her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
in those opportunities , the poem came with the poem and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word .
and when i heard that , i thought that &apos;s unheimlich -- this is exactly how my creative process .
that &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a maultier . to work , i have to get up every day at the same time and sweat me and sweat me and really awkward .
but even i have this thing in my lab sometimes , sometimes this thing .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
myself , i had to work or ideas that from a source through me , which i really can &apos;t identify .
what is this for a thing ?
and how do we start losing our minds without losing our minds , but to keep ourselves in intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example of how you can do this , the musicians can waits tom waits . i got to interview it a few years ago .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of his life was the embodiment of the gepeinigten modern artist who was trying to master this unkontrollierbaren creative creative impulse that lived in him to master and with them .
but then he was getting older and quiet . he told me that one day drove up to los angeles , and there &apos;s all changed for him .
he sounds at high speed than he heard a little bit of a melody , and he sounds a little piece of a melody , which is , as it is , and he wants them . and he wants them . she &apos;s prachtvoll . he &apos;s lechzt after that , but he can &apos;t believe it .
he didn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he &apos;s got no pen , he doesn &apos;t have a kassettenrekorder .
so he starts to go up with these old beklemmung , like , like , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be followed by that song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t create it .
but instead of diving in panic , he just stopped .
he ended up with gedankengang and did something completely new .
he looked in the sky , and he said , &quot; sorry , can you not see that i &apos;m going to drive car ? &quot;
i think that &apos;s like i could i write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a moment when i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , somebody else today .
go and quäle leonard cohen .
his whole arbeitsprozess has changed .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as ever .
but the process and the heavy beklemmung that surrounds him was no times where he made nothing as in trouble , and he zurückließ where he was in the way he came from . he realized it didn &apos;t have a verinnerlichtes , quälendes thing .
it could give a eigentümliche , surprising , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the fremdartigen , äußerlichen thing that was not quite tom tom .
when i heard this story , it &apos;s a little bit of the way i worked , and i &apos;ve been saved .
and i was this idea , when i fell in the middle of „ eat , pray , love . i fell in one of these things that we &apos;re going to fall , and it doesn &apos;t work . you start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster . that &apos;s the worst book that has ever been written .
not only bad , but the worst of time .
i started thinking , i should just einstampfen the project .
but then i remembered how tom talked to the free sky , and i tried .
so i took my view from the manuscript , and i spoke to a blank corner of the room .
i said loud : „ , you know , you know , you and i know , both when this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see , you know , i &apos;m investing . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to pop up here and follow your percentage of deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what the heck is .
i &apos;ll keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you to the protokoll that i was here today for my part of the job .
because , at the end , it &apos;s like follows . centuries , in the end of the end , in the desert , in the deserts , nordafrikas people who were gathered with sacred and gathered and gathered , the hours of hours -- until dawn dawn .
these strong were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , something special happened . one of the actors actually became überweltlich .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen in your life already one performance .
it was as the time stillstehen , and the dancers through a kind of pforte , and he did nothing different than he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything put together .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem to be human .
it was light up from the inside and it &apos;s light down from the bottom and everything through a göttliches fire .
when something happened then , people knew what it was . they called it on his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : „ allah , allah , allah , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historic fußnote : when the mohren südspanien came into this practice , it took this practice in the centuries , the centuries of „ allah , allah , allah “ “ , olé , olé , , olé , olé , that you still hear about stierkämpfen and flamenco-tänzen .
if an artist in spain in spain did something , something magic did : „ allah , olé , olé , großartig , great , großartig , großartig “ , there &apos;s been great , there is : a flüchtiger look at god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning , when the dancers wakes up , and realize that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and it &apos;s no longer a fünkchen from god .
he &apos;s just a alternder sterblicher with schmerzenden knien , and maybe he &apos;s never going to go up to those heights .
and maybe someone will never be told again , when he turns out , but what do he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the schmerzhaftesten korrekturen of a creative life .
but perhaps it doesn &apos;t have to be so much of pein , if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning , that the most extraordinary aspects of their existence came from them .
if you might just believe that you &apos;re leihgabe -- from a unvorstellbaren &apos;s source for a erlesene time of your life , which is passed on someone else if you &apos;re finished .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so , i started thinking , and so i think in the past months , while i was working on the book , that &apos;s going to appear -- as the dangerous , scary , strong expected to my abgefahrenen success .
what i &apos;m constantly saying to myself , if i &apos;m going to talk about it , i &apos;m not afraid .
not entmutigt .
just do your job .
is still for your contribution , whatever it does .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the dumb divine genius that &apos;s asked you to the page , you decide , for a moment , you &apos;re going to be able to show a kind of wonder through your effort , then „ olé !
and if not , dance , however , dance .
and „ olé ! “ for you despite all of that .
i believe this , and i feel that we should teach that .
„ olé ! “ for you , despite all of all of that you know , the mere human love and you &apos;ve got to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
olé !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic the arctic that the arctic , for nearly three million years the size of the bottom 48 48 states , has increased 40 percent .
but this is not very strong enough the seriousness of the seriousness of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thickness .
in some sense , the arctic arctic is the beating heart of our global klimasystems .
it grows in winter and schrumpft in the summer .
so the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a zeitrafferaufnahme what happened in the last 25 years .
this is rot with red .
as you see , it grows on the dunkelblau . this is the annual ice in winter , and it &apos;s declining in the summer .
what we call the dauereis , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which is out of the body .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
this is a problem because warming is the frozen ground around the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s huge amounts of gefrorenem of carbon , which is when he auftaut to methane to methane from microbes to methane .
compared to the entire amount of klimaverändernden materials in the atmosphere , it could double double , if we cross this critical point .
today in some flat lakes in some flat lakes , methane is methane from the water .
professor katey walter at the university of the university of another group in the middle of the last winter .
wow !
you &apos;re good . the question is , how will it ergehen us .
and one of the reason is this huge building warmer from the north .
this is a jährlicher tauwasserfluss .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is the kangerlussuaq river in the southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the level of sea level goes up is going up in the sea .
these rivers take a rapid .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest eismasse on the planet .
last month , researchers named researchers that the entire continent has now had a negative eisbilanz .
and the westantarktis showed up about a couple of unterwasserinseln , is particularly strong in the melting .
this is 20 feet meereshöhe , like greenland greenland .
in the himalayas , the drittgrössten eismasse , you look at the upper lakes , which were a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their trinkwassers from this schmelzwasser .
in the anden , this glacier is the trinkwasserquelle trinkwasserquelle for this city .
the wassermengen vergrössert .
but if you versiegen , too , most of the drinking water .
in california , there was 40 percent reduction in the middle of the sierra .
this is betrifft .
and the predictions of how you read them are serious .
this austrocknung in the world is going to fire a dramatic .
and the catastrophes everywhere in the world have a really ausserordentlichen and it has never increased before an unprecedented extent .
so many four years in the last 30 years of the last 30 years .
this is a completely unhaltbares entwicklungsmuster .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it anrichtet .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 produced every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons every day .
look at the area of the eastern pacific , the american continent and beiderseits of the indian subkontinents , where there are a radical decrease of the oxygen in the oceans .
the biggest one for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the nevertheless biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest verschmutzer , together with china .
and the proposal was to build many more kohlefabriken .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that were taken out in the last few years with some green alternatives that have proposed .
there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the kohleindustrien and ölindustrien has spent a viertelmilliarde dollar dollars last kalendarjahr in order to provide clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me .
for christmas , on my home at home in tennessee , a billion tons of kohleschlamm .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our entire country the zweitgrösste of america .
this happened to christmas christmas christmas .
one of the ads of the kohleindustrie at christmas was this .
frosty is a vergnügter , happy guy .
it &apos;s in shell and abundance in america , and it helps our economy to grow .
frosty , the kohlenmann is sauberer every day .
it &apos;s affordable and liebenswert , and workers stay in lohn and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful bergarbeiter is the ladder of massey coal .
so let me tell you . al gore , nancy , nancy pelosi , harry reid , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance of climate protection has called two campaigns .
this is one , part of her .
we see climate change as a serious threat to our business .
that &apos;s why we &apos;ve put it up to us at the top of the top of the world , to spend a significant geldsumme in the way to put on the way to get the truth of coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells pretty well .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let &apos;s leave it .
saueber coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean kohlefabrik .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean kohletechnologie .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable clean kohletechnologie that you see here , changes everything .
look at it , this is today , clean kohletechnologie .
finally , the positive alternative with our global challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that all of them together is our dependence from kohlenstoff-basierenden fuels like dirty coal and ausländisches oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us from this misslichen situation .
versorge america with 100 percent clean electricity , within the next 10 years
a plan to make america back to work , and help us , to help us stop global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
versorge america , find more out .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a neuversorgung of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on old , dirty fuels , to reduce our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create good for jobs .
versorge america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
we need to come far and quickly .
thank you .
i want to start to ask you , at the time of your childhood , when you were playing with bauklötzen .
as they realized how to get their hands down and zugreift , the klötze , and move them , in fact , they learned to think about thinking , to understand , to understand , and to change , in fact , to change .
spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
so , as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of a computer scientist , for the kind of the way that we would be able to be able to move computers on a flat arbeitsfläche , and i think -- what if we could intervene with both the hands of the hands , and to physically capture the data that we could organize it , how do we want ?
and this question was so emotional that we decided to explore the answer and developed siftables .
in short , a siftable computer is an interactive computer in size of a kekses .
you can be moved with the hand , you can see each other , you can capture your movements , and you have a screen and you have a funkempfänger screen .
much more important : are physically , why you can just move it out of your hands and access .
and the siftables are an example of a new generation of hilfsmitteln to manipulation digital data .
and when these tools are going to become physical and awareness of their movements for their movements to recognize each other , and we can see the surface of our umgangs with them , we can begin to explore new and more entertaining .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
this is the siftable konfiguriert , and when i put it in a direction , the video will play forward , if i &apos;m going on it in the other direction , it &apos;s walking backwards .
and these interactive portraits are taking each other portraits .
so if i put them together , they make their interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by voneinader , you notice that and you can see something nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and curve .
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures on data , like colors , how to do this with liquids .
in this case , we have three siftables as farbtöpfe konfiguriert , and i can use them to pour paint in the middle of where they &apos;re going to mix them .
so if we &apos;re doing it , we can do a little bit .
there &apos;s also some nice opportunities in education like languages , mathematics or logikspiele , where we &apos;re trying to give people the possibility of fast trial and see the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a series of numbers that i &apos;m making with a simple gleichungsprogramm .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle .
basically , you get every round of siftable , and you &apos;re trying to form words , you &apos;re being tested by a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , mixed again , and you have a new buchstabenkombination and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came on a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to this , try and put a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting situation in this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s a couple of people who are testing it .
this is our youngest beta-tester on the bottom right there .
it turns out that he just wanted to stack .
so for him , they were just bauklötze .
this is an interactive trickfilmanwendung .
we wanted to develop a lernmittel for sprachlerner .
that &apos;s felix .
he can bring new characters into the scene by aufhebt the siftable of the table , which shows this character .
this is what it makes the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he gets a tractor into the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the siftables , and you can put it next to each other , and you can get the characters .
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story open , and it can decide how to evolve .
flying cat .
the last example , for me , i have time to show it , is a musik-sequencer for live-auftritte , which we have recently developed and in the siftables as sound like führungsstimme , bass and drums .
each one has four different variations ; you can choose which you want to use .
and you can organize those notes into the sequence of the sequence that you can organize in any patterns .
and you &apos;re speist them , just by just a ton-siftable .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filter .
you put it up with a certain tone , and it tends to hire it .
and then , then , übergeordnete effects like speed and volume that you &apos;re doing on the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we start when we &apos;re going to start with the führungsstimme in two sequenz-siftable , and this one in a row , and put it a little bit more the voice .
now i add a bass .
now , i &apos;m going to do something else to do .
and now i &apos;ll plug the filter with the drums so that i can control the effect live .
i can speed up the whole sequence by putting the pace into one direction or another .
and now i plug up the filter with the bass , for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as she &apos;s going on .
and so i don &apos;t have to do it in the past , but can improvise ; you know , you know , or verkürzen .
and finally , i can ausblenden the whole sequence by running the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my desire is that my desire is to develop new mensch-computer-schnittstellen , better to how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new design-welt , and some of the possibilities that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the thought that i &apos;d like to give you to the way is that we are on the threshold of this new generation of werzeugen with digital media , which is going to bring information into our world that &apos;s going to bring our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to you all .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m glad i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
i don &apos;t have to step back a little step , and it &apos;s really busy with the modern molecular biology .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been doing this for a couple of years , and that i started to know , because i wanted to know , and i wanted to do it in all of the things that i learned in studying .
so that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i kind of wanted to get closer to the matter .
i think that the molecular biology is in general now , in general , all of the biotechnology , what you &apos;re talking about , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now that &apos;s extremely important and much more , much more important will become in the future .
there &apos;s so controversial things like these genetically engineered plants on the äckern plants .
now there &apos;s craig venter in the u.s.a , which is trying to make biofuel , so gas from algae .
then there are things that have come to most of the people , what most people are not aware of , for example , for example , for example , that allow us to wash 40 degrees laundry with 40 degrees of laundry , also invent enzymes .
and the list , you can continue .
and so from the interest in this technology , i &apos;m going to go on .
so what hacken hacken ?
most people know that from the softwarebereich .
computers hacken , and it &apos;s always going to be in the media , yes , the hackers break somewhere and claws , and so on .
it &apos;s kind of a really sad thing for the hackerszene , because it &apos;s not true what it &apos;s really starting to do , and what it &apos;s really starting to do .
and in fact , in the &apos; 70s , the &apos; 70s , started computerbasteln , and it &apos;s also made the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and the problem , it &apos;s also a technological problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a social problem , and it can be a social problem , so it can be a frage , so you know , a question , and how you can do it differently or how to do it better .
and it &apos;s been halt with software , but there &apos;s also there in the elektronikbereich , there &apos;s a whole kind of bastlerszene , which is going to do all kinds of things with elektronikschaltkreisen all kinds of things .
and so , in direction , i &apos;m going to take this metaphor that , you know , you know , the metaphor is a more abstract code , because there &apos;s a more abstract code code , that it &apos;s not quite like computers , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s matter , so real matter is , and not just cyber .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also programming it , and so you can also find it , so that , and i found that i find incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper down .
this actually has taken zweitausend eight , eight really form , these networks of these networks .
there &apos;s hackteria dot , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe , and with cooperation in india , in india , which is now members , or active people around the world .
this is a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and in collaboration with scientists with scientists with these technologies , to go through these technologies and ask questions , and it &apos;s creative , and yes , all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s really about finding a lockeren access to a lockeren access to a playful deal .
and then there &apos;s do-it-yourself-bio dot dot .
this is from the u.s.a of a network , which is actually more a kind of forum , where you know where you meet and discussing online .
they are a little more technical and a little bit of businessmäßiger on the road , and then then they &apos;re going to ask questions .
and based on these networks that have done the whole popular thing , you have developed a scene that i just want to porträtieren .
here in the image on the top on the top of the top , you see biocurious , which is a hackerspace principle , basically a kind of a school , private school , a private school facility , where everyone can go .
children , old , all kinds of people go on to just go through it , and they set up a laboratory , and look at what you can do when these laborprotokolle are .
here &apos;s a group in indonesia , house-of-natural-fibers is called house-of-natural-fibers , but it &apos;s already quite a long time .
it &apos;s longer than these other two networks .
it &apos;s also in such an artistic aspect of biological materials , and , you know , too , elektronikbasteleien , and combine it in quite abgefahre ways .
now , a group that i &apos;ve met this one for a while a while ago , which i want to give the public more , what they learn in college , what they learn in college , and they &apos;ve been trying to try and try and explain to explain what is d.n.a .
and i have a lecture on the top in copenhagen at the medical museum in copenhagen with an exhibition in copenhagen with an exhibition .
and this is , yes , it &apos;s mostly very young people , but the only thing that &apos;s united up is this fascination by technology .
and what you can do with it , and you can start to ask the society and ask , so well , okay , what do you know , what you want to join in , have your interest in your interest with you ?
so , in order to hacken biology , you kind of need some material .
you need to take biological materials , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s then a laboratory .
what you usually understand under a lab is that , you know , you know , that &apos;s kind of abgefahrene machines , extremely distanziert , extremely distanziert , only for fachpersonal academics trained academics with a ph.d. and so on .
and our approach was just to say , o.k , that actually , you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because each one of each kaffeeautomat has actually developed technology than most of the laborgeräte , which is really like it .
and that &apos;s my premise with this premise of brian degger in england , for example , is trying to do a minimallabor degger degger in england , and then a dampfdruckkochtopf und , and , yes , yes , and it &apos;s grown up with that bacteria .
so everyone , once a soup of soup is that he &apos;s been left for too long .
and then i &apos;ve tried this in my lab in my lab , a little bit , and i took a little bit of d.n.a on ebay and a little bit of d.n.a analysis , trying to do a vaterschaftstest , so it &apos;s like d.n.a fingerprinting , again , home .
this is actually not supposed to be a joke , but now .
you see , in the picture , you see , the lab is , in anführungsstrichen , you see , in anführungsstrichen , a group in anführungsstrichen , which is a group in college , which is a group in the setting up there , and it &apos;s quite successful , and it &apos;s pretty interesting things , and that &apos;s where i &apos;m going to give you a little bit of interesting stuff .
and this is biocurious , which is , you know , you know , hackerspace , that &apos;s a kind of kind of kind of , in molecular biology .
and yeah , you know , it &apos;s relatively relatively relativ , you know , so there &apos;s been people who are on their own home , until too large organizations that hold up to large organizations , it &apos;s already in institutionalisierter form .
but always the idea of the approach is that it is easy to be accessible .
the first project we &apos;ve done as an international group , when we were kind of consciously aware of our ourselves , as we &apos;ve been aware of ourselves , as the real scene here , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people , and so we know .
and then the founder of the founders of the founders , and we &apos;ve said , you know , well , we have to make a real place , and we &apos;ve got two of them , and then they have two events in london , zweitausend 10 , and shortly on the u.s.a , in san francisco .
and , you know , you know , yes , you know , what are we want , what we want , what do we want to share ?
and what are our values and what are our purposes , our foundation ?
and that &apos;s where we have a code-of-conduct out .
and that was quite intuitive , so everybody has his wishes , his wishes , and what &apos;s going on , put it .
in my opinion , i think , a very good code .
and then we have it is not verbindlich , but that &apos;s not verbindlich , you know , i think , in fact , has a relatively good job , and people are quite convinced .
and we actually tried to go back into the academic world , but it &apos;s somehow not that arrived .
so i think we &apos;re in terms of the biohackerszene , in terms , in terms , in terms of a step further than the academic world .
yeah , what projects do we do now ?
a project that i did with the hackteria-netzwerk in switzerland , was that we wanted to make a so-called optical trap or optical pinzette .
this is when you focus a laser beam , in a space , you can catch small particles in the air , or in the liquid , and then move on this focus , so that &apos;s then captured there , so it &apos;s like a traktorbeamstrahl principle .
it really works , it &apos;s going to be done in academic setting , and we thought , you know , we took a webcam , and we took a webcam , the aufgeschraubt , the lens , and then you &apos;ve got a microscope , you &apos;ve got a microscope .
this is the bottom there .
and then we did a d.v.d brenner brenner , and then we tried to focus the laser and then trying to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we have learned a lot .
so a different project that made from the french group in paris , which worked , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and he &apos;s got a kind of like this , as a hirnwellenmessgerät , or something like that , so he &apos;s engaged with neurobiologie , his nickname , his nickname is sam neurohack .
so he built this helmet helmet this helmet , and in the cooperation with the museum , the museum .
and then you could go into the room in the room , put on this chair , put on this helmet .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought or how they thought they were thinking , then they &apos;re all different lights in the room .
it was a pretty schickes project .
another thing from the united states , which also has to do with these vaterschaftstestgeschichte , is the p.c.r , which is the polymerase-kettenreaktion , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes to copy the genes , to replicate , d.n.a , to be able to make it visible .
so now , when i do that , you know , in the scene of the scene , where i &apos;m going to go out there , and then make these things , and then they &apos;re going to do this method , and then they can say , o.k , this hair , to this human hair .
and the machines that are doing this is quite expensive , you know , you buy commercial , the least , the least you &apos;re going to do it with viertausend euros .
and that &apos;s not in the hobbybereich , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be a lot .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
and they were going to be rangesetzt and said , and they have open up , and they have open source of open source , and then they have open source , which is open source , elektroniksachen , elektroniksachen , and they &apos;re going to be able to get this device , and they have now the cheapest supply of these devices in the world .
i think somehow a hundred dollars or something .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s in any case in a frame where it &apos;s clearly available .
so , i think it &apos;s a very gelungener hack .
a project that i recently started to build was a gene-gun .
gene-gun is , you know , like this kind of kind of a kind of a kind of luftdruckpistole , two inches or something .
you invites d.n.a d.n.a , and then the goldpartikel d.n.a into these luftdruckpistole , and then i put them on zwiebeln , and then they put them on zwiebeln , and then they brought up .
so the device that you see , which doesn &apos;t work .
but that &apos;s what my prototype looked like , but that &apos;s what my prototype looked like in a branch of a branch like this , on it , on it , and it was attached to the pressure , and that was too high , and the pressure was too high , the thing was broken .
and then i took a sahnespender and connected to it .
a sahnespender , if you do it with water , it &apos;s got enough pressure , so i think , you know , 40 to a sechtzig bar .
and then you can speed up the particles strong enough , and then you can go in your zwiebel .
and the commercial device costs about fünfzehntausend dollars up or something like the commercial .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically doable .
so , that &apos;s the moment , at the moment , the kernanliegen of technology , the verfügbarkeit of technology of technology and also increase the information and to increase the information that more people can engage there .
because , as i said at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have a lot of the idea of it , and also no chance to make up there .
because , if you just read about it , from sekundärliteratur , that &apos;s not the same as if you did it yourself or seen it .
and i think technology is always becoming more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to make meaningful decisions in society , and you want to meet meaningful decisions in society , you want to have access to knowledge , you need access to knowledge .
and you have to do it , and you have to understand it and understand it .
and then the firmiert is open under the schlagworten open and the citizen science .
so , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to improve as citizens with these scientific technologies .
and this is the kernanliegen of the biohackern .
these are the people who , at least , at least on the website , d.i.y.bio-dot-org website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that it &apos;s also represented in southeast asia .
that &apos;s what i think there are fewer people saying , in fact , when they exist .
so i know about some who didn &apos;t put them .
and this is just the biohacker , the individual people .
and partly with these hackerspaces , they put these places together .
and that &apos;s in the beginning .
as i said , zweitausendacht has only started .
and hackerspaces , so the computerhackerspaces , because the c-base in berlin was the first , neunzehnhundertfünfundneunzig .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , infrastrukturzentren that are represented all over the world .
and , of course , of course , we &apos;re hoping that we stop the same way , and then they &apos;re very well connected , so you know , you know , you know , you can get more people involved .
and i would invite everyone to deal with it , and try and try it .
it &apos;s not so simple now , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity , and enough energy , you get too far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hello .
how do we actually work ?
this is a question that was very moved to me as a designer , but in the realm of forschungsbereich , and in the field of user , in the user .
there is how you &apos;ve encountered people in an interactive media so that they can use these interactive media media , and they create an essential experience .
and what i believe is that interactive media systems in us , so cognitive models , which is , in our biological memory , has been einprogrammiert in a very long time , and that we can just cause them through interactive media .
and that &apos;s very amazing because you actually believe that these hochtechnologie , which you &apos;ve been in there , that you &apos;re in the future , but in fact , the future is that the future is exactly with us , in our archaischen roots .
what are they actually archaische models ?
i &apos;ve written four stichworte , and i &apos;d like to just explain to briefly .
and to archaischen cognitive models , these are the models that we have in the 1930s times .
to be heard of these archaischen models , we have heard that we have basically natural relationship .
that sounds basically unusual .
i &apos;m going to go to it again , and i &apos;m going to prove to you about trying to do a natural relationship with it .
the second point is that we &apos;ve been able to be able to speak for this archaischen models in the situation , even though we &apos;re able to use a kodifizierte language today .
and the third area , which explains about itself .
we all know that the interactive media is nonlinear by definition , which includes the denial of the linearity , and what of course , of course , is that we &apos;re linearität as normal .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of informationsweitergabe .
now , what is that now with virtualität , which is actually the most natural thing about the world .
i &apos;d like to show you .
how many doors has the house where they live ?
we won &apos;t be able to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s happening right now .
they go through the spirit through this house , in demn , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they virtualisieren the reality , and it &apos;s no computers .
fantastic , right ?
and that &apos;s where we have trouble for example , for example , for example , the virtual reality , the virtual reality , that we can actually do that all the time .
and this wealth is the virtual reality the virtual reality that people have had to virtualisieren people in the other time , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any fotolitografie .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing that they had was their head .
and in that head , the memory played .
in this head , knowledge abgerufen , and with these virtual images , the imagination , they were also passed on .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with virtualität .
the interesting thing about this is when i can do a little trip .
yes , that .
what &apos;s interesting about this is that at that time , at the same time , at the same time , the medienproduzent and medium itself .
now , if you think about a little bit further .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that it has been a change .
but i &apos;m going to talk about that again .
the central tool of informationsvermittlung has been the history of stories .
schamanen , priests , so-called wissenswächter , were extra for extra to keep knowledge in stories .
and also today , we have very , very , very strong stories .
the author of the book the storytelling animal , jonathan gottschall , according to a year , we &apos;re still eintausendneunhundert eintausendneunhundert hours of stories every year .
this means a kid for a child that has spent most of its life spent most of his life with the rezeption of stories .
now , we think our love our love to stories that we have been a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far missing .
that &apos;s a lot further back to the other time , in cultures .
but for me , in the field of interactive media as a particularly impressive , we have verankert in our biologischen in our biological memory , the ability to think of nonlinear .
i brought to you one example of the north american tribe .
and life lived in the küstenregion of british columbia .
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very inselreiches area , and you had to navigate in the island of the island to get food .
and they did this with what they call lead-landkarten .
you may be familiar with that , you know , if you &apos;re interested in the australian nations .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have lead-landkarten , but they have used that kind of gennanten or traumpfade .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation could be taken by regions of regions about songs .
with the language of untergeordnetem &apos;s rang .
that means you &apos;re talking about sound and rhythm .
and these sounds and those sounds , of course , have enabled the geology that showed the topography of a region , and that also allows you to put these songs and put them differently , and to the left , to the right , could move back to the ausgangsort .
why are we not singing anymore to come from the top to to a to b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
this is what happens as a gennante machine .
we &apos;ve done this before in the so-called vogt-zeitalter .
this is the history machine , and what happened is the book , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happened .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have a responsibility for our memories , and that our individual memories have shifted to external media .
on the book and on the image .
so , unfortunately , we think of god &apos;s a piece of verlernt .
virtuality is suddenly fremd fremd for us , and it has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , it &apos;s a famous book , he means that the book of media , he means that the book , he says the book , and so on the internet and so on , and so on what we call as media media today , that this mass mass of our memories , and our ability to virtualisieren our ability to virtualisieren .
let &apos;s do a little zwischenbilanz .
from vogt-zeitalter to the machine machine .
what has influences to our thinking and on our erinnerungsvermögen ?
and then the verblassenden of the ancient cultures .
and they &apos;re going to be over the course of the centuries more and more and more überschrieben through the einflüsse of the maschinenzeitalters .
that means , instead , instead of remember , we have to remember , far , a lot of common patterns of memories of memories that we can hang our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce anymore .
we have an abstract language .
we don &apos;t think about the thing more in pictures of things that aren &apos;t in pictures , but we kodifizieren them our language .
we &apos;ve got used to do things linear .
and we accepted the essence of law , and there &apos;s only exceptions , like , for example , the non-linearität .
what &apos;s left is the storytelling .
we still have the storytelling as a informationsvermittlung very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
we had the vogt -zeitalter , we had the machine machine , and we &apos;re going to go to the so-called cyber-zeitalter .
it sounds very spacig , and it sounds very exciting , and i know .
but these concepts of the cyber-zeitalters , they bring us back to discover our skills again .
there it &apos;s virtualität , it &apos;s about virtualität , it &apos;s about storytelling .
i want to explain a little bit about this .
there &apos;s technical concepts like the augmented reality reality , which is called the extended reality .
so if you look at google , for example , for example , for example , for example , if you look at google , this is a concept of what makes us combine the virtual world with the real world , which is called our affinität to virtualisierung , virtual as a normal , natural sense , again , angesprochen .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
and so , of course , of course , in the context of the talk , of course , that &apos;s where we &apos;re talking about , physically in not existenten , virtual worlds , quite after the model of holodecks .
and another example are the ambienten , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to people .
all of this needs the ability , our basic ability to be virtualität as a real habitat .
i ended up in the degree , and i hope that the video works , a very , very beautiful project , this is the bachelorarbeit of michael burk , ann-kathrin krenz , joris klause and jan-moritz müller .
and the two are also here today .
maybe you may be going to get up for a moment , so you can get into the front of the project with the two .
and this project i brought together , for example , as again , as again , about this archaischen , cognitive models .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
what &apos;s of course , of course , of course , is extremely entgegenkommt , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer games , you &apos;re very likely to have a very likely to see that people have some people who have some konsolen , or they play with some kind of konsole in the hand .
anyway , they &apos;re doing that in it .
this is a game for out .
and that is that i think that i discovered the outside the outside of the world , so i found the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , which is the data that we produce , which we produce with the real world .
i apologize that i have to abkürzen so strong .
you can explain that much better , you know , there &apos;s more a lot more behind it .
and it &apos;s about that i discover a city , by looking at what &apos;s positive or negative getwittert .
and so i get a very different impression from the city , a very different impression , which is a very different impression , i see the negative and positive zones of the city , and it &apos;s a very different way of a city , and it &apos;s a whole different city of a very real city .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re like to look at now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation about what you &apos;re going to see .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , is clear .
and with a kind of flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to give this my talk to my talk , and that &apos;s in the sense of the properties and the skills that we have acquired , and that &apos;s a little bit of the skills that we have acquired , and that we &apos;re going to be on this kind of complex , technology , technology , new products , actually not into the future , but actually back to us back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be able to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked to be , if this bag is a sprechender bag , and i &apos;m going to talk to you .
he &apos;s not going to do that .
i &apos;m also going to auflösen what is in there .
but so far , i just do it a little bit curious .
yes , kids are from nature to be curious or should be curious , designers .
i &apos;m gestalter from house , of course , of course , of course , of course , and how does the curiosity change our thinking , and why are we going to lose curiosity and have to neu , and so on and so on .
this is a whole number of things that you have to do with the actual own existence .
when professors are curious , they &apos;re very often forschungssemester reingeschoben .
and that &apos;s also what i had over the last half a year .
it &apos;s a forschungssemester for natural user interface .
now you will ask yourself , why are all the designers in such as such as natural , archaischen urformen of communication , interaction and so on .
and i &apos;m just making one of these little devices , because things should be more intuitive , always natural , benutzungsfreundlicher , and then you have to see what is actually for us , of course , of course , of course , or intuitively .
and before the background , i &apos;ve been in the area of natural users , which is the next generation of the human computers in the way that the human computer is working on how our tools , or how the computers are changing from the computer to the digital assistant .
so i &apos;ve been busy doing it , of course , or intuitively .
maybe again , take a look back .
why does this happen ?
so , when we look at the development of our society , right here , we &apos;re going to move from the third gesellschaftsgeneration , or gesellschaftsform .
so from the modern computergesellschaft .
every society is shaped by a primärmedium .
in the beginning of the language .
that means you &apos;ve got a common language , by having a shared language , you could communicate with each other , is moved into the same cave or in other areas , evolved cities , or villages , and have created in the same way .
but it was the language , something very natural , a very natural living .
now , you have to learn to learn , so no one can &apos;t be able to speak of nature , but we learn it , of course , of course , verhältnismäßig .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
that was a riesen-aufschrei because of course , because of course , of course , because of course , of course , the living language , which means what is what &apos;s fluid and alive , i &apos;ll get it into stone it in stone , and i do it .
depending on how i meißel and when i meißel , of course , it &apos;s a very different coverage than if there &apos;s one of the things alive .
but then , in the sukzessive , then , it was einzug .
then the next generation that we &apos;re actually still living in today .
this is the pressure of pressure and print geprägte with gutenberg and others .
at the time , it was a affront where adel , klerus , and other people said , you know , in fact , when the people want to read , then they want to get up after , after , and that &apos;s of course completely fatal .
and now we come into the next generation and the exciting one , so a generationswechsel is just a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really at the moment in this phänomenalen phase that we &apos;re doing something like that .
so , of course that confused us , because we see the new media &apos;s new media , socil social media , facebook and so on .
and what the new thinking is , what the new thinking is , i don &apos;t tell you that in the lasagne , don &apos;t say , and no longer any more or other phenomena , or other phenomena , i want to do this right now , and it wants to kundtun .
and these two worlds are just pop together , new and old thinking .
the exciting thing is , if you look at this , this new society , these computergesellschaft , diese very many of a lot of mechanisms , and archaischer paradigm from the stammesgesellschaft .
but it &apos;s not at the local level now , but at a global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
the theme of ecology is a global global .
not when i think local green and the neighbor is thinking less organic , then no longer work .
this is , from the local village , a global village has become a global village with the same principles , which of course , of course , but also the total transparency .
as you were in the village in the village , who has what has happened to whom and when , today , that &apos;s about this extension of our ourselves through these mobile endgeräte at a global level .
whether it &apos;s that we know all global and faster and better and better .
as it used to be on the village .
so , in front of the background , i have to look at this , which is , of course , of course , of course , which is , of course , of course , which we have , of course , is what we have , but also instinctively , what makes the difference ?
because often , people are coming , they can do it , so that everyone can handle it .
so you have to engage with this , which is , because it &apos;s not just simply changing that it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s supposed to be better .
and then , of course , of course , is something intuitive , and how i can take an impact on it and make things so that they are a benutzungsfreundlich , so they &apos;re very intuitive , because then they are fun and they &apos;re easy to use .
so you &apos;re busy doing it in the degree , with the subject of perception and the wahrnehmungspsychologie .
and of course , of course , this is what you start and look like , and look , okay , now i &apos;m just looking at the inner self .
and what does it actually look like ?
so how do we work when we reingucken ?
and what does it mean , of course , of course , and how do our channels work , and how does the cognitive processing work works ?
because steve jobs said , you &apos;ve been able to dig to dig deeper to understand to understand it .
so you really have to look at this in detail if i want to do something more benutzungsfreundlich or intuitive , what is called the core .
and you see , you know , most of our seven senses , most of our seven senses , most of the time , you know , in fact , in the near future , there &apos;s been still in the near future , and in the near future , and as an extension of our self again .
and look , how do we process information , how do we take information information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that is a difference .
a lot of people use the word , but they don &apos;t even know what it means .
but i have to understand in the core , in the creatures , when information becomes information to information , and from information , again , to know how to know how i can do things as well or , of course , can do things too .
and of course , how design is an impact on perception .
so what we see here , if i do things , i can see you verwirrend , like on the right side , where i don &apos;t know what is salt and pepper , or i can make them sort of intuitively by showing things .
so a lot of natural natural , in a gefäß , but i look directly directly , right , where is salt and pepper in it .
and if i say to someone , give me salt or pepper , then he will look at the right first , where is what &apos;s inside .
and then on the left , i hope , and i hope that no sugar in there is no sugars .
but also our perception itself , how does it make us think .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks larger than the little , even though it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just very large , and yet our perception changes , depending on what context we do .
does anybody know what this is ?
come on .
pattern recognition should still work .
it &apos;s already more like my glasses of glasses .
so it &apos;s the n circle .
a second circle starts to feel similarity or associate or associate .
and then , if i don &apos;t just look at a halboval , we don &apos;t only look at just one unit , and then a circle , and we see a unit , we see , we don &apos;t see more three parts , a circle , a circle , another .
that &apos;s what you call a gestaltgesetz or just gestaltpsychologie , which also affects us in perception .
for the gestalter designers , they have the first semester , the great semester .
gestaltgesetz of the continuity of the continuity and so on .
and then , in the third of the third .
but that &apos;s an essential part of an essential part , if you want to do things so much intuitive .
so the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting .
sounds very banal , but it &apos;s exciting when you &apos;re excited about it .
so we &apos;re on the front of the eyes and now think , we &apos;re looking at the front of the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you can see from the back to the front .
because you know , you see , you know , you know , you can see what you can see , beispielweise circle .
that means we &apos;re just looking at what we see before we see it , again , back into our seheapparat , to say , okay , okay .
and i &apos;ve got cognitive rückkoppelung , you know , what you want to see .
and this is then there , again , coming back .
then again , it goes back to the back , because the back of the back and says , now look at look at sight , i &apos;m going to do now , and make sure if what you see , that &apos;s also what you want to see .
and then again , it &apos;s back , and then it &apos;s going back to it .
so a very , very spannender process process , how certain things happen , and what these things happen to happen .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s known by you .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i just described .
now everybody &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes .
does anybody see a little bit ?
a dalmatiner , right .
if i &apos;ve seen that , there &apos;s a dalmatiner in it , you know , you know .
you &apos;ll never forget it , because i &apos;ll show you where the dalmatiner is .
now you see the dalmatiner .
and on , you always look at it .
so , i &apos;ve actually verdorben you now that you don &apos;t see a pattern of patterns , but i &apos;ve got it in a very short time in a very short time to see this dog in this verworrenen picture .
and this is the projection of looking , rückkopplung .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m going forward to see that i see the dalmatiner .
i see the dalmatiner .
so , very exciting processes that then in this , you know , you know , you don &apos;t actually , but here in this rosanen mass .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
this is our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to knowledge as a designer .
if i know , something takes three seconds , until i kind of look at the present in the vergangenheitsschleife , then i can bridge a very well to bridge that i &apos;m going to bridge by someone with three seconds .
it doesn &apos;t have to process .
then it goes into the past , and so i can bridge a very elegant wartezeiten for example , for example , when i know this phenomenon .
what takes fünfundzwanzig milliseconds milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time you fall in love .
that means being aware , if you know , you know who you look at how long you see how long , because i &apos;m not going to take a lot of what can happen so that .
and sechzehn milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the most of most perceptions we have .
that means that this first impression happens in a rapidly rapidly fast speed , as we perceive things .
and as we also see things , what we &apos;re looking at and how we protect ourselves back against our environment so that we can think that way .
of course , the designers are not only involved with the issue of perceptions and neural verarbeitungen , or kognitionsergonomie , but primarily , with the subject of mensch-objekt-beziehung .
so , what a human being with some things .
so there &apos;s a lot of practical functions , so there &apos;s so formale aspects of things , so formale things .
there are anzeichen-funktionen , where i know exactly where i have to reach .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why gives you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of täschchen , where you don &apos;t have a little bit of reinpasst , so horrende of money , of money , even though it &apos;s not so practical ?
that &apos;s where we are more likely to be on the symbolischen , on the bedeutungsebene , which we &apos;re looking at as a creator of course .
now , back to my own topic of natural users , and the subject of course , of course , is usability .
usability always means how to be able to get a certain goal , or how an users can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be efficient in a particular sense of efficient , efficient and zufriedenstellend .
that &apos;s what it says that &apos;s like the norm .
how can i make something more important ?
can i be able to use that directly , or i need &apos; n , or i need some of the training of training .
and less usable or benutzungsfreundlich is .
that i &apos;m just making it different and fun , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and then , if you have the software that we &apos;ve seen , you know , what we &apos;ve seen , you know , why neunundneunzig percent of our today is a little intuitive or not based on anhieb , in many areas , including i-pad in many areas , including , although it &apos;s more intuitive more intuitive than classical software .
it &apos;s not until apple , not only since apple , not only since apple is a fundamental wirtschaftsfaktor , if i just want to use technological devices .
why ?
because in the rule we are usually through these new kinds of nutzbarkeit , which is the natural user , for example , for example , five times faster on the average .
and you have to imagine that if you do something about classical softrware , five hours , and with this new kind of software , only one hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you might probably be able to go home four hours , but your employer or your employer , and you &apos;re going to do it with the four hours .
but i want to say it , of course , of course , of course , of course , is , of course , is a lot of things .
and then when we go back into the field of the software , there &apos;s the first command line that were very abstract , where you took months to deal with these systems .
then the next one that came up with the nem neural model or mental model like the software system , you know , you could have an idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to harness the computer .
so not more zeros zeros and ones , or kryptische code , but a metaphor .
this made a lot of benutzungsfreundlicher , but it , of course , of course , a lot better .
so the next generation of graphischen benutzungsoberflächen works very much more with behavior .
so , i &apos;m designing as a gestalter , as a result , as a result , which looks like that .
this is also a paradigm shift .
so that i &apos;m always going to look for success , right now , that &apos;s going to be an app app .
and if i take a step back into these natural users , where i &apos;m talking about voice , by language , by language , by sprache , by gesture , and nicht the things that have to drive things , i &apos;m still going on and another .
but also , again , at the time , when do things become more intuitive ?
when they become more intuitive , and then i have to look at my little friend here , and look at what it means because of course , from the point of view , when is it really intuitive ?
and that &apos;s for us people is always intuitive when i have to think about it .
so he doesn &apos;t like to think of it , but it &apos;s just doing it .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for designers ?
that means that , if we look at using what we &apos;ve been able to translate on the existing handlungsmodelle of one another , for example , the metaphor , for example , i can use it as a creator .
that means i can just translate an intuitive , human handlungsmodell into software , and to make a lot of the software .
well , of course , the question is , of course , is the intuitivste handlungsschema of us , and now i &apos;ve already told it .
this is called the osit-modell .
it &apos;s used by each of us , and it &apos;s an acronym , and it &apos;s an acronym , selektieren , informieren , informieren .
all of them all of them all the time , but it makes it unconsciously , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive or partially , or partly .
the model is already ausprägt in the womb and it &apos;s interkulturell , so it works in the world &apos;s young and old , and it &apos;s going to be used by us all the time , without most of us knowing that model .
osit osit is going to be about 50 to siebzigtausend times of us , so you know , in the sleep , you have noticed that it &apos;s less often strapaziert than the day .
now , i can see this mental handlungsmodell , selektieren , informieren , inform , übertragen , carry on a interaktionssystem .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of desktops , right now , but it &apos;s not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a handlungsmusters , a handlungsprinzips .
and this is on a higher grail of benutzungsfreundlichkeit than that the transmission of the classical metaphor , which is the desktops .
and so , for example , for instance , for example , in the way , for example , for example , when i &apos;m in the übersicht , for example , for example , in which i can look at it in detail , and i can look at it , and yeah , i can see , i can send it anywhere or buy somebody and so on .
then i can transfer the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to try this through a beispiels .
yes , everybody &apos;s eaten .
in fact , i use to interact with the object , again , can rauszoomen , reinzoomen .
i &apos;m going to figure out the whole point of this , right now , and i can say , you know , just show me all , for example , for example .
and once you have an interface , which is significantly more intuitive and much more natural .
because i can grab things like the bits , touchen , and they come to me , much more natural , more natural organized websites or other kinds of mechanisms , or other mechanisms , to make these things available to these things .
imagination is more important than knowledge , and with this sentence , i want to be able to think , a designer , designers have to think differently to come into new solutions , and in that sense , i thank you right for your attention and please .
i want to give you a certain aspect of curiosity .
the first one , if you &apos;re big as a child , you know , and depending on whether your parents have allowed them to be able to play more or less in the töpfchen and put more , the more , of course , , of course , of course , is starting to do it .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
and that &apos;s why all of that are , they &apos;re curious , in fact , is people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
it &apos;s about basically this whole umweltdiskussion , weltuntergang , 40 years of club-of-rome in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point .
and it depends on phosphorus .
give pee a chance .
every day , they give the scale about two grams of phosphorus , and every day you have to give phosphorus two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have a bone .
we could just glide as a amorphe through the weltmeere .
if we don &apos;t do phosphorus phosphorus and give us phosphorus .
amazingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re doing something about what we &apos;re doing here with something , but not that way .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the phosphor-problem .
the phosphor-problem is a lot more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only got phosphorus for two years , and now , through the world , through the world , through the world , is being able to be able to be a lot more uranium in the environment than in all the atomanlagen .
in the last 20 years alone , fünfzehntausend tons have been distributed tonnen tons of uranium on our fields in the fields .
and that &apos;s what we take .
it &apos;s doing leukemia kids .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little harmful .
so for instance , for example , schütz , the environment , drive less car .
the environment , make less waste .
the environment , verbrauche less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
this is how if i say , if i would say , schütz your child , just three times instead of five times .
that &apos;s just a little bit less destruction .
so , if we think about the wiege to the bahre , then our entire earth , our entire earth , it will be a friedhof .
that &apos;s about thinking about the wiege of wiege .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as the first thing .
in the ground , there &apos;s a sechzig percent saved .
we &apos;re going to build corn , and 30 pounds of 30 tons of 30 pounds per hectare , or 30 pounds of 30 tons per hectare .
that means we lose about five times more than new times .
so , of course , of course , we can look at the müllproblem .
and everything is ja or content .
for example , in offenbach , 20 percent , 20 percent of the müllmenge is now windeln .
and because we get older , the windeln are getting bigger .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re all in the vorwindelphase .
yes ?
a baby takes about six thousand windeln .
now , we could do that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is balanced in china in china .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go to this windeln ?
here is one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be emitted to the pigs over the festen .
people about the urine .
yes .
so men don &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what it does , right ?
we think in umweltdiskussion , we think we are too many in the world .
and if you get the people who do you know , when you say , you know , that would be better , you weren &apos;t there , then you &apos;re going to be raffgierig and hostile .
and so someone like al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing to stabilize than the human population .
in israel , you say , if you &apos;re a human race , you rettest the earth .
here &apos;s the more you umbringst , the better .
yes .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about five times more than we humans .
i could use termites , but in the united states , nobody in the united states as far as far as you are a vegetarian .
that means that the ants weigh much more than we weigh .
and because they work much harder than we are , and because they live only three to six months , they are in their weight , in their energy consumption , something 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and when you can see how far we wanted to get away from the way we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , and how sad we are at all , for example , for example , you can see , for example , for example , have a program , for example , for example , would want to be klimaneutral , right ?
you can only be klimaneutral if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only opportunity .
have you seen a klimaneutralen tree tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be trees as trees , yes ?
yes ?
no tree is kohlenstoffneutral .
for happiness , yes , yes ?
there &apos;s no überbevölkerungsproblem on trees .
there are still six billion of trees alone .
have you heard some of the trees of trees ?
that means all of our intelligence means that we want to be trees as trees .
and where you see , even at a bit like west , strikteste agriculture , it doesn &apos;t allow agriculture to go back to our own stoffwechselprodukte .
every year , we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back in two .
and we are too many .
just about it .
that &apos;s what we feel guilty about the earth that we say . there &apos;s no bio-landbau , no bioland , no nature-et-progrès , and as they all called , that allow us to go back to our own exkremente .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we are too many .
it makes sense to be less harmful , to be ölverbrauch .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s going to be a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for the society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it comes to the environment , is the highest , right ?
nullemissionen , yes ?
you can only have nullemissionen if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shot now , they would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can back our nutrients .
we are in brazil in brazil where we get back to nutrients .
we can be able to move on this kind of nutrients in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china , for example , in china , for example , for example .
and in china , in china , you know , in china , in china , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , our nutrients .
and that means that the whole western city has always taken out of the city of the city , but the farmers never get back .
and the cities that we had to grow the cities , because the farmers were going into cities , and the cities had to go to the cities .
that &apos;s why all the western rich rich is always expanding until they haven &apos;t done the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re implodiert .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done bruchlos civilization over five years for five years because you &apos;ve always been able to make nutrients .
even today , if you were invited to dinner , you expect to eat in china that you &apos;re going to stay as long as long as you seek the toilet .
because it &apos;s unfreundlich to go to go and take nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to eat them , not to the nährstoffdiebstahl .
that means you can see the internet as you can get back to nutrients .
and this is actually , when you do that , if you do that , if you do it , it creates agriculture , on a hectare of five people in favelas , you can do a farmer for about eintausendfünfhundert dollars , and you can wait for the plant , and you &apos;re waiting and ducks and ducks and ducks and fish .
and the cool thing is that , in the favelas , in the favelas of the favelas around five percent .
so we don &apos;t need to control the people to be able to be bad .
we can be able to be good .
that &apos;s natural , of course , of course , but the plants carry themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by the design that a farmer can put it .
that means it &apos;s going to go back .
and none of those facilities , we &apos;ve been built now over hundertfünzig in the last 20 years , none of those facilities has ever been sabotiert .
you could easily easily reinwerfen a liter of altöl , and then it would be ruined for years .
it doesn &apos;t happen .
that means we don &apos;t need to control people to be very much bad .
we can be able to be good .
that means we need to phosphor phosphorus .
and by the way , when you want to do what you want to do , you know , in germany , in germany , it &apos;s best geeignet by all the treatment of the treatment .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not in offenbach , but maybe you can do a little bit of a little bit .
because the frankfurter plant could be the phosphorus .
and that has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it works .
we &apos;ve been used for three years now .
the dutch government has explained , they will be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need that overall .
understand , there are two countries that control are almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of waisenknaben .
these are sechsundzwanzig countries controlling 40 percent of the ölvorräte .
and the oil is going to replace it by other energieträger .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace the phosphorus .
so it &apos;s not about making the existing a little less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and most of all , first of all , what is the right thing .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
in holland , of course , you get easier , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if your wife is sad , if you have your wife , if you &apos;ve got them geärgert , and you get to 50 .
very inefficient .
but it &apos;s really effective , yes ?
or take a lippenstift .
a woman in germany is eating three pounds of three kilograms in their lives .
there .
this is not exactly true , because we don &apos;t know how much weggeküsst is going to do it .
but a lippenstift , even in this lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but really effective , yes ?
one thing that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s why not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
questions , what is the right thing ?
not to burn a little bit better and burn it , and burn it into the verbrennungsanlage and get the whole materials to lose all the materials , but first time , how do you include two ?
imagine it effizient efficient .
yes ?
if i einlade them to dinner , and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with offenbach-geschmack and a glass of water .
wonderful , yes ?
this is efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with yourself , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything that matters in life is not about saving , not to avoid .
all the umweltdiskussion .
we tell people , oh yes , you don &apos;t have a green in the south .
no , that &apos;s just the right , yes ?
in every place where you wegwirft , you know , yes , you can lebensmöglichkeiten .
but the wrong things .
if you wegwirft the wrong things , you have a müllproblem .
as we think of the north .
that &apos;s where every footprint .
if you run , yes , every footprint is the ground .
because the ground is going to die the mosses die and the wind and the water is washing the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water remains longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint , which is a hot footprint .
not schuldmanagement .
we say in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask them , how are you with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , herzliches beileid , yes ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so , you don &apos;t save .
any waste is nährstoff .
and it &apos;s a lust when you see in italy like the people in the high bow of the car , to kick out of the car .
because you know , this is a lustvoller process .
it &apos;s an amazing form of revierverhalten , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
for example , for example , we have developed a eiscremeverpackung , which is in room room .
they can wegschmeißen where they go and stand .
it &apos;s in two hours everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they throw it out of biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there are two cycles .
not all of that should be kompostierbar .
a washing machine , or a washing machine , they don &apos;t use them , they don &apos;t use them .
just the things that verschleißen , like schuhsolen , like bremsbeläge , like autoreifen , who have to be so that they go into biological systems .
the things that are just used to be used in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the sneaker , right ?
it &apos;s not for the company , not for the company , not for the company , but that they now help this company to make these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t do the things that we don &apos;t do .
yes ?
so , if i go to food and say , this is free from hähnchen , then it doesn &apos;t help you anything .
no , we put on what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like detox .
not toxic .
it &apos;s all in it is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can go on the fußgängerampel of the fußgängerampel , and you can go biologische into biological cycles , yes ?
all of them is kompostierbar .
and if we can do it , of course , of course , for adidas , for nike , for hennes and mauritz and all the textile industry .
and this is half of all around the world that are caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to do it with people .
hey , puma , power are you really serious ?
because that &apos;s what they have now changed twice the vorstandsvorsitzenden .
and i &apos;m not sure if they really dabeibleiben .
so , let me give you a little bit .
but it goes .
yes .
this is what &apos;s been shown .
this is .
we can do things so now that if you &apos;re verschleißen , if you &apos;re kaputtgehen , you can go into biological cycles .
technical cycles , in the same way .
there &apos;s this direct rücknamesystem .
this is the first green backpack , actually , which is made to go back into the circulation .
it &apos;s also , in any store , you can zurückkriegen things .
if you come on that , yes ?
do you remember the windel of the windel ?
now , when it &apos;s the trash .
there &apos;s this windeln around , almost .
in the countries where people get to money .
on the front of the deponien , but also in the front of the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastics , so that it can change in biological systems , when we change the plastic , you know , you can just go back to zellulosebasis , you can go back to a baby in israel or in tunisia in tunisia .
yes ?
if you take these windel this windel , you know , sterilisieren , sterilisieren and the powder the powder to produce trees .
so the baby is kohlenstoffpositiv for the whole life , already from the beginning .
so we don &apos;t need to be klimaneutral ; we can be klimapositiv .
it &apos;s about a beneficial poop print .
yeah .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything else .
i started an institute of this .
there are many people working there , and they can be engaged with them .
there &apos;s extra a group of them , cradle-to-cradle-verein , where everybody can join .
so no longer saving , verzichten , avoid , reduce , not schuldmanagement , not schuldmanagement , but intelligent waste .
do you make this curious ?
thank you .
the work of interpreten .
music as a language .
in the description of my speech , written that i &apos;ve written as a interpretin , i know , in english , understand .
interpreten are the language of the written notes in klingende music .
you know , you &apos;re not just a word of word for word a word in a different language , but also the deeper sense of the words , so that you have to make a meaningful translation , anyone who has to do it with fremdsprachen .
you can translate out of the english in english , to be able to translate more knowledge , because it &apos;s about poetry or even about poetry .
natural , it &apos;s fremd , but for laien , what we live with our musiksprache .
so , as a musikstückes , i just have the written notes first .
you think that the composer into the notes is exactly hineingeschrieben exactly everything that he imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and ungenau .
and these notes are about just the same or ungenau , like a verbal , as well as it seems to be genaue , beschreibung , description of a landscape .
because in this verbalen landschaftsbeschreibung , the smell of flowers is not to smell , the degree of grüns is not to hear the säuseln of the windes , not to hear .
that means that the paradigm of the paradigm must have to translate these ungenauen to one another , which is hörbare , concrete , concrete , nonverbale .
today , i want to tell you what i mean , what else i want to translate , you know , translate into your own language .
so basically a translation of translation .
that &apos;s why i &apos;d rather like to do it in german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be equivalent to the translation translation of the translation of translation .
so , the music works as much as the spoken language .
the notierten notes have the function of the letters .
so it won &apos;t take , just to learn grades , and to get the keys on the piano on the piano on the piano or the right place on the piano .
because that &apos;s just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
and the sense of the letters you can see when you can &apos;t see the language .
so for the learning process of music , you need to musiksprache at least at least as long as long as long as the spoken language .
so there &apos;s also abstufungen , if you learn it to be learning to be able to understand , and you can be active , to the musical speaker .
the work of the interpreten starts similar to like a theaterregisseurs .
and when you start playing a piece of chosen , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re going to take a forscht of the composition of the composition .
you accumulate information about the piece in the sekundärliteratur .
you read in the letters , tagebüchern , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thought of the composers itself .
you studied the works of the works before and after .
so you compare to them .
the beweggründe to write it .
what did he feel like ?
how were the circumstances of the society and the politics ?
it &apos;s all interested in me .
you think in that time by reading contemporary images or looking at the literature .
now , in the time , you know , in the way , you know , you have a very rich knowledge about the composer that you play more often , and it gets easier to feel into it .
the composer is going to get more to the friend that you live together .
his cause to write the piece , and more and more and more of my personal concerns to play it .
now , since the notes , it &apos;s all the other than an accurate record of the composer , it &apos;s just a framework , i &apos;m going to turn this scaffold to a sense of meaning , again , and meaning .
so , i say , in my own words , what could be written between this framework .
i play erklärend what these sound might have .
now for me , and for the composers , and what you might mean for today .
every note , each phrase gets a sense , because i feel it myself because it comes out of my own right now .
it &apos;s got to be around here , and now , you know , you know , i can &apos;t convince the audience to convince that that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been doing as long as neu in advance .
so , how do you know a happy new day , even though with the same rituals of life , stand up , eat , my job , to work , i also have the same piece of the same piece again .
i &apos;ve become a day older , and the seasons change , and my pulse goes down to the morning , at night , is it takes longer to come back to sound coming back to the home .
i &apos;ll take the audience for the audience , aware or unconsciously .
and all of this affects me , and all of that affects my experience with the composition .
well , in fact , if i &apos;m standing with a duo-partner on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , angeregten conversation conversation .
you get a new idea in it , and it &apos;s due to answer with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we don &apos;t have , and what you can &apos;t do as well .
it makes great fun to make this sense of music , and you as the audience has experienced how the music is alive .
so every concert is a different concert .
i &apos;m never going to be able to play like that right now .
i can &apos;t play the same way in 20 years .
i &apos;m going to have more lebenserfahrung than today , and i &apos;m going to have a lot more lebenserfahrung than today , and i &apos;m going to have a lot more farbnuancen in the musikklänge of emotions and emotions today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have a couple of farbtöpfe , but then , for this new dazubekommen .
i have a nice concrete example of this .
it was on a klavierkursus for musikstudenten at my loved old teachers , professor jürgen ude , a known beethoven-spezialist , konzertpianist , and long professor of the musikhochschule here in stuttgart .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so that he was already emeritiert when i finally started studying .
but i was lucky enough , it was very early , with 13 years , to get to know , and so i &apos;ve been able to meet in my classes .
i was 17 when i went back to one of his courses , and i played the last of the four balladen of the four of the chopin , a spätwerk .
he asked me what the introduction of this ballade was for me .
this is a getragenes part .
and in my jugendlichkeit , i said , expectation .
and he said , he said , &quot; that ?
this has to be altersunterschied .
because for me she means memory .
he was already über .
well , in 17 , you have dreams , but you don &apos;t have a significant memories .
i play the piece of the piece of all years , and always has gone back to me , even though it has not changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because again , i read something new .
an example of it &apos;s a completely different area . monet die the seerosen .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different tageszeit , at verschiedenem light .
he &apos;s translated the seerosen verschiedentlich , translated as he saw her , like she looked at this moment .
his personal impressionen of seerosen .
the x-malige interpretation of a piece is like this .
now , i was also older than chopin with zweiunddreißig years when he wrote the piece .
he only lived for neununddreißig years .
and it &apos;s important to look into the notes , even though i think i could memorize it .
in order to keep zwiesprache , right with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection to him directly .
especially when he died .
now , how do you start talking to the language of music ?
i said , you know , you know , you know , for about the spoken language .
and so many times , you know , you can only learn the notes .
you can basically read that before you just talk one word a word .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
then if all of the fingers in time and right as it turns out in the notes , they come up , and they sound together like music .
if that &apos;s all happening , the student gets the nächstschwierige play .
it &apos;s barely talked about interpretation .
well , there &apos;s presto on the front of it , which is a fast piece .
lento , slowly .
loud and leisezeichen , f and b , etc .
most of this .
but also , if you put these on , it &apos;s still a little technical .
and it &apos;s always no interpretation .
i wonder .
i &apos;m wonder that you &apos;re often a little bit of elementares .
that is , in order to make music on the instrument that are going to do your musical musical and feel before .
that &apos;s what singing .
a child that doesn &apos;t sing , because the parents don &apos;t have their parents , it will not be done by themselves .
this is like sprechenlernen .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and the idea of music to have a more way of bringing it to the instrument of one instrument .
people who never was singing , and as a result with his own body , as it is to make a sound .
to design a phrase with his own breath .
that is the erweiterung of our body .
our vocal vocal to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
this is how the sequel of my fingers are the sequel of my finger .
the melody comes out of the gesungenen and the rhythm of the dance .
the dauernde berieselung today is not förderlich with music .
you don &apos;t need to make more music yourself , if it becomes boring .
no need to sing a liedchen or to sing .
each of the music is going to be plattgemacht when you &apos;re constantly on the outside with music .
sure , there are some of you who say yes , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
the question i &apos;m not able to sing , a because you believe you can &apos;t sing you ?
or b , because they don &apos;t learn to sing ?
in two , it &apos;s not too late to start to figure out whether they can &apos;t do it , or learn how to learn how to learn these little muscles that einstellen the vocal voice , right .
that &apos;s what you can train .
or c , because you bescheinigt them , they &apos;re untauglich .
and i &apos;m asking , how were this diagnosis ?
do you get a zweit- or drittmeinung , how do you say it today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and you want to do nothing to do it .
but what i was going to do is regret , because music is a beautiful , kommunikative thing .
but maybe you can even umstimmen them .
well , you know , you know , in all cases , nobody must have to be a aussichtsloser candidate .
but don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand anything about classical music .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
i say , but sure , you know , you can say if you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says , you know , i don &apos;t know if i can &apos;t cook , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , you don &apos;t get rid of the food , just because you can &apos;t cook .
so she doesn &apos;t have to get rid of classical music because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to them , and tell if they taste it or not .
whether the music is too sweet or too sweet .
tell what they feel .
in time , they also get standards , and they want to make something more spices there , or taste even fine gaps .
why now , i &apos;m going to challenge you from my audience that it &apos;s also active ?
because the music is a language and a language is there to communicate .
a piece of art that you never look at is no force .
the food that we eat from a chef or a chef liebevoll , has got to be eaten , and not just looked at recipes or shared recipes .
so you please hear when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice geräuschtapete .
if in an environment where the adults are making music or at least active music , a child grows , it &apos;s easy for a musiklehrer , asking , which color has your flower ?
can you also play it in blue ?
and the child is playing after a gedenkpause , instead of a red flower , a blue flower .
and this sounds quite different than before .
so that was the first beginning of a musical musical expression .
so the first step is an interpretation .
and what happens if you play a piece of it , that &apos;s been written by a hundred or a hundred years ago , or even three years ago ?
now , the instruments are fortentwickelt .
and there was bachs as an instrument at all .
it was just not invented .
i think that the stream would have been thrilled if he had had the most klanglichen possibilities of modern medicine today .
i can see today the klangvorstellungen that bach had had , on the modern wing wing , which is not a barockes cembalo .
also , by beethoven beethoven , you know that he heard more , when he was already deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that an orchestra was rejected by the time .
and so the composers composers are dependent on us to reinvent the pieces .
so that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to be up in the mind .
and what you might think about today in the mind .
or what i &apos;m doing today , because what you might have thought .
thank you .
do you know what envy is ?
were you really neidisch ?
and how did that feel ?
suck .
i have a friend that &apos;s driving a passerati .
if i come up with my little v w w , and i &apos;m next to the point , that sense .
i shoot something through the head .
i say , ulf , what do you need to have a big car ?
that &apos;s the first year in half of his value .
and at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford little car ?
and then , you know , one , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward feeling is away .
and the organism has invented a great way to get these kind of unpleasant feelings like envy .
you can try this with words like revenge or ähnlichem .
so i want to give you a little bit of this mechanism with this mechanism today , or something that &apos;s näherbringen what you &apos;re probably familiar with .
the mechanism comes from lying .
but if you don &apos;t think about the lie , as you might have heard when people say , nobody has a wall .
and then steine auftürmt , so he &apos;s versperrt them .
in a lie , you see that the liars itself doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to check out that it has a very different sense .
he just makes you think it &apos;s not yourself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , that they do have to do with that they do .
you need this lie to get a selbsttäuschung .
they can get less easy , yes , nachprüfen or also to collapse .
they need time .
from this time is an anecdote that you might know .
spanish painter pablo picasso once has a woman portraitiert .
this woman beschwert afterwards , the portrait wouldn &apos;t see her .
picasso says , just wait .
it &apos;ll always be more similar .
in this point , and if you laugh , you know , you know , how important this lie is , and how much time you need to experience something that artists can tell us very well .
because artists have a gestörtes relationship with a lie .
the artist shares them something with , and especially this lady lady , which doesn &apos;t see if they just look in the mirror .
the artist shares them in a portrait of something that they &apos;re first familiar with when they &apos;re going to look at this piece of art .
then this awkward feeling disappears , it may not look like you , and more and more and more similar to them .
so here &apos;s this mechanism mechanism that we can use , as a great invention , as a great invention of our lebensverhältnisse .
and not only in the art , also in the volksmärchen , in the mythology , in stories , it comes up again .
you may know this idea of the lady that looked at every morning in the mirror , and asked him , who is the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a schönere .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you can also know how much hostility from this wahren from this true , you can &apos;t lie from this true of that true .
but we should just be familiar with that , you can &apos;t tell a woman , you can &apos;t tell you that there &apos;s a schönere somewhere else .
so here &apos;s necessary , what we see under politically correctness , and they put them back .
we need this lie where we have the deception , which we don &apos;t even survive .
we don &apos;t just have in art , in the volksmärchendichtung , but also in science as great lies in science .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s wife of worchester .
she heard about this book of charles darwin , the origin of species and the line of the people .
that the person &apos;s man should be abstammen , and you know , at least a common ancestor there would be between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her to her husband and he said , you know , that &apos;s not what charles writes .
the man is supposed to be abstammen , or a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent people out of it .
why are we going to prevent people from something to come true ?
because we can &apos;t live with these lebenslüge .
because we &apos;re at this selbsttäuschung , this sense , this sense of being great , abstammung of the world , not from one of those things like an organism that exists still , and it &apos;s like , and whatever things , which is for us .
so , we can &apos;t bear these things at all .
we have to prevent people who are finding knowledge of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism , and how the traces that he &apos;s leaving , which is going to lead to something else than to this great image of us , i want to show you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
my wife told me .
she came to one day from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told her a student .
a autistischer student .
she likes to love him , because he has a tendency to aufrichtigkeit .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire department .
and because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnische things .
yes , you feel that if you &apos;re heiter , there &apos;s something wrong there .
i told my wife , whenever a human being in a moral hand is because it &apos;s used , we should try to replace it through the wörtchen .
once you do that , and then experience the sentence .
although i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnische things .
you feel that this is the real truth behind it .
it &apos;s a little bit of bub , which is not interested in feuerlöschen .
they &apos;re interested in feuermachen .
but there &apos;s no clubs that we can look at where you learn where you learn how to fire .
there &apos;s just the second second , the firemen .
he was signed up .
and überdies , you don &apos;t want to say to fire to fire somewhere , and you &apos;ll be happy when the fire after the fire .
no , it just looks much better when we show that we &apos;re in charge of that , the dangers of getting rid of the other people , when they put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
and these verweis , in the bub of the bub , knew that it &apos;s actually related to the fire , but that it can &apos;t say loud .
so here you &apos;ve got this zensor between the unconscious and the conscious thing that you know , without you can do something about it , and the things you know that they look very differently , so designed you can look better for you and others .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do in the language that we have to use in the language of the politics of the politics .
in fact , we know that something else is .
but we know when we know that , the social stories are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible , things like that in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
so i want to tell you what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
what &apos;s this deception , this selbsttäuschung , the willingness , the willingness , a different reality as the ones that we already know in the unconscious , that it &apos;s valid to spread out .
so i want to show you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is ahead of what many of you know , and some of them , very few of them don &apos;t need at all .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is sort of a piece of mental says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not from stop stofflicher , physical nature .
and if you have people who have a solid belief , you know , you have a soul , you know , you know , you have a soul , you have a soul , you know , that you have a soul , or not matter matter matter , you only out of meat and blood , a little bit of steinernes to the earth , vergängliches , verwesbares , unwichtiges , unwichtiges .
and so from this soul soul , you think that somehow it in this wolkigen nature , in this luftigen nature , it &apos;s called the lateinischen , the lufthauch , your mind .
and when that lufthauch then , you know , over the people , then it &apos;s filled with dignity , with nature , with nature that can only live with soul .
and then he can just davonlaufen .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we &apos;re supposed to perceive them as something that should be present to your life .
and if you have this assumption , you understand the logic that we &apos;re very fortunate to do with a lie our world .
because now you can apply a dreisatz .
you still know about school .
this is now a dreisatz logic that describes the logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk .
here &apos;s some logic of logic , but also the willingness to lie .
in fact , lying is that you can just apply this logic .
this is where three sentences come three sentences .
the first sentence is , klaus says , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if klaus is right , he &apos;s got no soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i found him in particular .
a third sentence , which immediately comes to people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul , which is dead , and can &apos;t say anything .
and here &apos;s it .
here &apos;s the logic of this , yes , in this täuschenden talk .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logical correct .
because i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t talk about reality .
i can say the kanzlerin is a man .
and if i was right , it &apos;s a man .
if i &apos;m not right , it &apos;s not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t have a statement about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but the key thing is , if i was right now .
so when klaus says , there &apos;s no soul .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he &apos;s got no soul .
these things are logical correct .
and now our täuschendes consciousness feels immediately , you can do something .
it &apos;s a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and it &apos;s like the opposite of the first sentence is already proven and vorausgesetzt .
because in fact , we have to prove whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with that logic , which just uses two sentences , and a third dazuhängt that looks like that , as if it &apos;s going to do it , we can save our lebenslüge .
so , we do as if it &apos;s actually impossible to be able to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things on different examples .
so in the present present , we have a very modern example of modern example , and again , füllt .
at this point , you have to have another philosophisches issue , a dauerbrenner from philosophy , your mind .
this has to do with it that we go back into the vierzehnte century .
there was a scholars who was called johannes buridanus , named nach named buridansche .
the buridansche esel is a esel , der from pure nature .
it &apos;s not that soul .
this is a naturding .
and if you put exactly it in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of two gleichgroßen , it verhungert .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a haystack he should go first .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
this is what the naturdinge introduced .
gleichgroße forces , with gegensätzlichem forces each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
only if you take another example , so if you &apos;re going to get a haystack bigger , then it doesn &apos;t need any reason , and it doesn &apos;t need anything .
and he goes to the right thought .
so , if you have this idea that you have been driven in nature , in nature , from the larger pile that you &apos;re going to wear immediately , you quickly have the feeling that there needs to be a free will .
and if we &apos;re also here in frankfurt , i remember the max-planck-institut in brain science .
there &apos;s a scholars that &apos;s called wolf &apos;s wolf , and by him sometimes , sometimes we say , wolf , there &apos;s no willensfreiheit .
now , we can create the second sentence and say , if wolf &apos;s wolf is right , he didn &apos;t have willensfreiheit .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we &apos;re now able to read almost every day in the daily newspaper , find that in this third sentence .
it looks like this , who doesn &apos;t have any willensfreiheit , can &apos;t be able to be able to have its actions , and behauptungen responsibility , and it &apos;s so unzurechnungsfähig .
you &apos;ve got it again .
in fact , you &apos;d have to first prove whether it &apos;s like willensfreiheit .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this as if the first sentence of the place is wrong as if you take the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just , if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , you want to practice the courage for lie .
so take this for example , for example , if you meet a person who can tell you , there &apos;s no vorhersager .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for vorhersager , which is called prophet .
you &apos;re not allowed to call them , again , a little politically inkorrekt .
say , there &apos;s no vorhersager .
immediately , they &apos;re going to have a vorhersager of course of course , of course , of course , of course , you can &apos;t see , you can &apos;t prove that .
and you have a problem .
because while you &apos;re busy doing it , that you can &apos;t prove that you can &apos;t prove there &apos;s no vorhersager , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he fooled .
because he led it to a fährte , he &apos;s not aufhält himself .
because actually , this person is not interested in evidence .
he &apos;s just interested in that , itself , to have to prove himself to prove that there is vorhersager .
so , in the kind of shift in the beweislast shift , you experience of a lie of lie .
and once you have an opportunity to feel this dreisatz in other people , do it , do it , because they &apos;re going to be happy , if they &apos;re not going to remember .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve been able to ask myself if i can mention it .
she &apos;s one of the veranstalterinnen here from this great event , and she asked me if i wanted to give you a talk about my idea .
i have to be honest , you &apos;ve got it hard to talk to me at the beginning of my idea .
and may i think i &apos;ll think i &apos;m trying to picture you .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum , quite many ideas .
i &apos;m probably one of the two nice girls , still there , i &apos;m one of probably the generation that made for that bad öko image , because i &apos;ve started to study robots in karlsruhe , technical school , today , that &apos;s what i believe , you know , kit .
and then , in the middle of the achtziger years to berlin to berlin , because i wanted to renewable energy , and that was not in karlsruhe .
there was the kernforschungsanlage leopoldshafen .
those were all the kfa , which was the kfa .
that &apos;s called projektträger today .
because a good engineer has either built a great car or atomkraftanlagen .
but something like this , like &apos; n solarpendel , from some kind of watts from the square meter , that was a toy .
and in berlin there was a crazy ingenieurkollektiv .
i &apos;m grateful that he &apos;s told the word again again , because after the mauerfall , you didn &apos;t use the word anymore , because all the left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that in the achtiziger years .
there it was that there was selbstverwaltete alternativbetriebe , and one of them was sitting in kreuzberg in kreuzberg where you think about evil .
but that was wuseltronik , and it was called wind and wind and solar energy and i started in the middle of the 1980s .
and yes , a lot of what was told today , i &apos;m very , because many , many beautiful expressions that i &apos;ve gone through .
i &apos;ve been working 11 years of collectively , which was basisdemokratisch .
we were twenty people .
so , in no , it &apos;s the vetoprinzip , that &apos;s got an entirely zermürbt , and i &apos;ve got a little bit of gezweifelt , and i &apos;ve got a lot of jahre , because all of the colleagues of my father &apos;s colleagues , because all of the colleagues of my father &apos;s colleagues , you &apos;ve got the money to the window with your child .
it &apos;s busy beschäftigt .
and that was really , very bitter , and you know , in the same stage in the same time , in the way that i thought of , after 10 years , where i was asked for 10 years ago , of course , of course , in collective , of course , of course , in collective , of course , to be the great thing .
and i then got it up to sechsundneunzig ausgehalten , and then we &apos;ve been with friends with friends , which then , with the spin-off , which then , along with the spin-off of one of the largest zellenhersteller of the world .
and then , of course , we have a small group , of course , and we have a little bit of the future , and we have a little bit of course , of course , a small group , of course , and we have a little bit crazy , that &apos;s what &apos;s beginning to say that people say , what &apos;s going on , what &apos;s going on , we &apos;re talking about store everything .
and i brought a project to you now that i want to imagine you .
and the title of speech was , yes , as you get to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started with a relatively einfach-verrückten history story , where you know , you could have a memory for a memory today .
on this island , this is the island of graciosa on the azoren .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
there four and a half people .
they have a renewables today from 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have anymore ?
that &apos;s simply not technological .
when they zubauen more windkraft , the system starts to fail .
i &apos;m always telling the politicians when they were in berlin-adlershof our facility .
they always say , why ?
we already have 20 percent in germany .
it can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent , and our net is physically the european country .
if we had in europe in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , the first thing that was zweitausend2006 , have the first contacts to the island , but it &apos;s just through .
so how big would have to be a battery , so you have to be such an island of 20 , 30 , 40 , 40 , 50 , 50 , maybe 70 percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;ll go again again .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , a year of about a hundred gigawatt electric power on the world .
that &apos;s the equivalent of a hundred nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear plant , because that &apos;s particularly fast everywhere .
and the energiehunger of the world that &apos;s going to happen is gelöscht , because you don &apos;t need permission .
it &apos;s fast .
it &apos;s like that .
and then it looks like that .
in that run three of the dieseln , two will always wait .
yes , this is what it looks down there is the load down there .
we also get very detailed data .
and the windkraftanlage or the solaranlage or the solaranlage or whatever it is , is usually a system of a system or a system , which is just a system in small quantities here .
and our goal was just to say , okay , okay .
there &apos;s been back-up and the wind , sun control the burden that they can map the larger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewables , the energy a year , not the performance in the moment , you have to turn off .
that means that at the moment , they have to worry that renewables can make the whole network .
you know , of course , of course , if you &apos;re managed in some way in any way .
this has no one on the world .
that &apos;s in the small style , so you can also serve your rasierer over a little bit of wechselrichter .
people always ask me , what are you doing in adlershof ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
but if you want to be a number of these wechselrichtern , and you want to build a web , it becomes extremely complicated .
and we wanted to come to 70 percent renewable , and then you know , we wanted to get 70 percent renewable , and then the rest of this one , 20 , 20 percent renewable , that becomes very , very , very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work that you &apos;re doing it from batteries .
it &apos;s going to be a energieträger energieträger , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , or sch , that &apos;s going to be .
and then you have to go to a saisonalspeicher and not just balance it .
we just wanted to know what is a normal , stinknormalen elektrochemischen battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then made a whole bunch of simulations .
and the wind and the wind and the load , and came up with the result , a very exciting thing , a very exciting result , you know that you have a middle of the conventional system that will take a middle of about 50 cents a kilowattstunde of about 50 cents a kilowattstunde of about 50 cents a kilowattstunde .
these were the very first calculation six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the diesel-system , when you get five percent a year .
and then we started to negotiate with the insulanern .
what had to be done ?
with investors with investors , i was searching for new gesellschafter .
we were only five people at the time to rebuild the society .
and here &apos;s the picture again .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green system is our system .
that our system is also because of the system , is that we &apos;re going to do , 20 percent , and they &apos;re also not durchschlagen on the other .
and the power-utility that the elektrizitätsversorgungsunternehmen on the island , meant that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to find .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and therefore , we decided to build a hall in berlin where we can actually map the electric of the island of the island at scale to three .
that means we were looking for first to find the largest battery in the world .
here she is .
it &apos;s naturally from asia , in the case of japan .
and she &apos;s in the &apos; 70s in the &apos; 70s in the &apos; 70s , now , that was developed in the &apos; 70s , and then became auslizensiert to the japanese .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
it &apos;s got a megawatts and it can bring this power for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we have kind of simulationstechnisch rausbekommen .
and then they set up .
now , we also have one of those diesel-aggregate in the same size , as he says , in the same size , in the middle of this web , right now , there &apos;s , in the back of that , in the back , there is the big battery , there &apos;s the big battery here , here &apos;s all the umrichter that we simulate the net .
over here , we &apos;re simulate the whole übertragungsleitungsystem , the kilometer-physik of the cable , to make the schwingungsverhalten on the web .
and you can see this one again .
we can also zweihundert kilowatt kilowatt on the web .
here we see that again again , again , again , again , again , and individual aggregate .
and what we did has been done since zweitausendneun was then done , until today , almost everything between the einzelnen between the single system of electronics was to develop in software , we did .
so we &apos;re not batteriehersteller , but we define ourselves as a company that is only between the topic and the subject , and everything in between .
you have to communicate to the battery , of course , you &apos;ve got to communicate the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beautiful thing is on the subject that , on this , in this island today , everything we &apos;re going to get in the world that we &apos;re going to get , if we &apos;re going to increase our share of renewables .
so this whole discussion , which is going to go back to the moment and herbewegt , energiewende , how to go on the island , for example , for example , to 30 percent of exzessenergie , so we müdsen the wind and the sun .
and then natürlicht offers smart-grid .
so smart-grid , a riesenthema .
and we can start to integrate on the island , and start to integrate elektromobilität , because of the load of manage the load .
that means if you &apos;re 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can go through &apos; n smart-grid , you know , you can see the nets , yes , you should do it in every case , but you can never get rid of memory .
and this is the n slightly the message .
and so many people come in and look at this , because you can see what &apos;s going on .
if we turn off the diesel , then you &apos;re not going to have this spinning mass that causes a certain inertia in the net .
and our europäisches verbundnetz is basically only made out of all of the major kraftwerken , where the wave of the wave all over europe .
we look in this net web , you see 50 hertz , the 50 hertz , and when it komma komma komma nine hertz , we &apos;re going to start a little bit of merh steam , then we get back up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly träge .
if you runterreißen it somewhere , it &apos;s a little while .
the spinning industry has at least 10 seconds to keep the web stable .
and in time , you can react again .
if you don &apos;t have any more , this spinning mass , you have to replace it with leistungselektronik and elektrochemie .
and we can mit with this big battery two milliseconds .
you know , you know , you know , you have enormous data .
and the message is , we need to get on that rotating crowds , 20 , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 percent , seven , 30 percent , 30 percent , and so on , if we want to get to that rotating .
then we have to break down our must-run capacity in the net .
must-run is simply called the power power station to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a riesendebatte at the moment , from the kohlekraftwerken , because we don &apos;t have any , or gasturbinen , because that &apos;s not .
and we just try to tell you that you get the capacity that you can break down the capacity , which can break down , as well , you know , also , you know , bring out a elektrochemische memory .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a lot of studies .
and to that point , people come and look at the point of view , sort of , look at our inselteststand .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far you can get a piece of the future .
and a lot of discussions that i had over the last six years , was similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years for the subject .
it &apos;s not , schwachsinn , kinderspielkram , we &apos;ve got everything out of it , never .
we have 30 gigawatt photovoltaik in germany today .
this is vorbildlich .
and i just go from that in the next 30 years , that we have the same capacity in elektrochemischen the same capacity on elektrochemischen store around the world .
it &apos;s a very simple way .
there &apos;s going to be a lot of widerständen and arguments .
the beautiful thing is that i &apos;ve seen in the last two years , that scientists have been asking themselves on my side .
we &apos;ve got over 10 million förderprojekte , as well , in order to klemmen the german net .
this is going to happen in the next april .
so from this , you know , you know , there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s just a change from that abwehrhaltung , to the idea of the idea , a hundred percent renewable .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a autarkes system .
so far in discussions , in discussions , they are trying to do that , they have a little bit of a small web , which has nothing to do with our verbund .
and the question is really simple , if you &apos;re completely independent or any of any of the fossil fossil or uranen , which will become rausgebohrt somewhere in the world , and you &apos;re going to be able to be an island .
and then they only use what the sun and wind is there where they live .
and that &apos;s kind of a little bit of our vision , and i &apos;m also grateful that they said , they use solar power .
and that &apos;s what we do , and that &apos;s in that , the talk is , as well as premium kola , that you &apos;re going to be a collectively , and you use solar power , you &apos;ll use a little bit .
and yeah , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be a little bit crazy , and you can have a vision .
and you really have to stay in a pretty zäh , but i think it &apos;s going on .
thank you .
when steve lopez , kolumnist of the los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , sympathisch , rough , homeless , who played on a violin , which only had two strings .
and a lot of you will know the story , because of steves articles later , later , a book , later , a book , later , which was verfilmt , with robert downey , and jamie foxx ayers ayers ayers , the kontrabassisten , who was in the juilliard-konservatorium , who was a promising career , who was going to be finished by his paranoide schizophrenia .
nathaniel left juilliard , who had a nervenzusammenbruch and 30 years later , he lived in the streets of skid row at the center of los angeles .
and i &apos;m going to see you about reading steves book , or to see the movie that you know , not just the great connectedness between those two men , but also how the music was making this connection and how they ended up with the instrument , if this pun is allowed to get nathaniel out of the street .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney hall hall .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he spoke in a very heiteren and geselligen clay on yo-yo , and hillary clinton , as the dodgers will never make it into the baseball world , and all of this because of the tückischen passage , the first violin in the last sentence in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s symphony .
we came to music , and a few days later , i got an email , in which i was interested in who was interested in geigenunterricht .
i &apos;ve got to mention that nathaniel a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electric and handschellen and handschellen , a trauma that has his whole life .
and as a result , he &apos;s particularly susceptible to these schizophrenic stages , and they are sometimes so bad , and he disappears in the streets of skid row , always herumwandert at the streets of his own mind .
and in fact , in the same way , nathaniel reizstadium , when we did with our first class on walt disney disney hall , he hatte this irre in his eyes and seemed completely lost .
he was talking about invisible and smoke and how he wanted to poison him in her sleep .
i was scared , not meinetwegen , but i was afraid that i could sink up his relationship in one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship to the violin , when i started talking about scale and more exciting and other exciting forms of didaktischen geigenpädagogik .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven violinkonzert .
and while i was playing , i realized that in nathaniels , there was a total change .
it was as if he was under the impact of a invisible drug , a chemical reaction , which was my job .
nathaniels manischer , manischer , in understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace .
and like a miracle he took his violin , and he began to play a few clips from violinkonzerten , and then asked me to finish her up : mendelssohn , tschaikowski , sibelius .
we then started talking about music , from bach over beethoven , brahms , brahms and all the other bs , from bartók to esa-pekka to esa-pekka .
and i realized that he had not just a enzyklopädisches knowledge of music , but with her very close personal personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i &apos;m only aware of my colleagues in the philharmonie of los angeles .
by playing music and talking about music was out of this paranoiden , confused man , who was just moved through the streets of los angeles , a liebenswerter , gebildeter , excellent , in juilliard musicians .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
for nathaniel , music is emotional health .
because the music allows him to , his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something real umzuformen .
and so he entflieht his quälenden states .
i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
so this is why we make music : so we &apos;re doing something that in all of us , which is in our feelings , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity , can actually form .
and the reality of that expression gets us all , and moved , inspired and united with us .
what nathaniel set up , so brought him back to a community of friends .
the musik power of music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood his talent and achtete his talent .
and i &apos;m going to get over with nathaniel music , whether in the walt disney disney hall or in skid row , because he reminds me why i &apos;ve become a musician .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i have stolen the cellisten .
i hope you forgive me .
so i used to know a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first one , which was more like a passionate kind of .
it was a beautiful fish , wohlschmeckend , good consistency , gehaltvoll , a new on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it was driven in aquakultur to the highest standards of sustainability .
so , you know , you could feel to sell him .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
one day , the head of the company , and asked if i could make an event about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem for our chefs has become . how do we keep fish on our speisekarten ?
in the last 50 years , we have the ocean as we &apos;ve beaten the forests .
it &apos;s hard to überbewerten the destruction .
90 percent of the great fish that we love , the tuna , the heilbutte , the lachse , the lachse , they are collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so i guess or übel , fischanbau , fischanbau , part of our future .
a lot of arguments about it . fischzuchtanlagen verschmutzen the environment , most of you , and you &apos;re very inefficient , we take tuna tuna , a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a futterverwertung from 15 to one .
this is , 15 pounds of wildfisch is required to get a pound .
not very sustainable .
it &apos;s not very good either .
so there was finally a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to supported them .
the day before the event , i called the head of the öffentlichkeitsarbeit for the company .
let &apos;s call him .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; just to have the facts , you &apos;re famous to grow as far out in the sea , that you &apos;re not verschmutzt the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste of our fish is distributed from our fish . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this futterverwertung of 2.5 to one , he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what feeds her ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
and at that night i was in bed , and i thought , what is a sustainable protein ?
so i called on the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know this . he &apos;s going to know .
well , i telefonierte with some people in the company , and nobody could give me a proper answer , until i finally telefonierte with the senior biologists .
let &apos;s call it don &apos;t .
&quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some fischmehle , and then he said , hühnchen-pellets .
i said , &quot; hühnchen-pellets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , knochenmehl , reste , getrocknet , getrocknet , verarbeitet . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of that futters is chicken ? &quot;
by maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what is sustainable to feed the fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i &apos;m entliebte myself from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a selbstgerechter genießer and gutmensch .
that &apos;s me .
no , i actually entliebt out of this fish , because , i swear to god who tasted fish after that conversation .
this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love .
it is the romantic way that you know , the way you learn your fish , you love the fish .
i first ate it in a restaurant in südspanien .
a befreundete reporter had talked about this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s kind of verkuppelt us .
he came up on the table with a light , almost schimmernden color .
a chef had verkocht him .
wait twice .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
who can leave a fish so well after he got verkocht ?
i can &apos;t do it , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it miguel . it &apos;s actually called miguel .
and no , he didn &apos;t eat the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least the way you and i understand it .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
this is a fischaufzucht in the südwestlichen corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentiniern .
they raised fleischrinder on what was basically the wetlands .
they made that by doing the land .
they built these complicated consequence of channels , and they kept out of water from the land and beyond the river .
now , they couldn &apos;t do that , not economically .
and organic was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds around , which many birds are many birds .
and so , in 1982 , a spanish company has bought a spanish company with green .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of the water versa .
they literally have the lever .
instead of the water , they used the channels to hereinzuziehen the water .
they fluteten the channels .
they created a 11,000 acres of fischaufzucht -- barsch , meeräsche , shrimp , aal -- and they have miguel and their company the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
they stare out the horizon , which is one million miles away , and everything you see are geflutete channels channels and this density , lush march .
i was not there a long time ago at all .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part of charles darwin and part of the kiss . &quot;
okay ? we were and we were fighting through the wetlands and i keuche and schwitze , and schwitze , until my knees , miguel up to my knees , is a biologievorlesung .
here he lifts a rare gleitaar .
now , he mentioned the mineralbedürfnisse .
and here , it &apos;s looking at a pattern of concentrate that it &apos;s reminded of the tansanische giraffe .
it turns out that miguel spent the largest part of his career in the south national park in africa .
i asked him how he has become a fisch-experten .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes , and he goes into more talk of rare birds and algae and weird wasserpflanzen .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotische community unplugged , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak about this verkochte piece of köstlichen fish that i had on the vorabend .
so i interrupted it . i said , &quot; miguel , how is it that your fish tastes so good ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know that , &quot; i know , &quot; i know , the diagnosis , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what are your fish ?
what is the futterverwertung ? &quot;
well , he continues to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they were going to in the wild .
the pflanzliche biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely selbsterneuernd .
there &apos;s no food .
ever heard of a farm that would not feed their animals ?
and later i went on this site , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems like that , &quot; unlike every farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure ? &quot;
at the moment , it was as if a director had a director .
and we um around the corner and we had the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinker pinker , which is a literally buchstäblich nature of the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , he said .
&quot; look at your bäuche , pink .
they schlemmen . &quot;
schlemmen ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; miguel , don &apos;t you do your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fischeiern to the birds .
well , last year , on this land , 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it has become the largest , and one of the most important private vogelreservate in europe .
and i said , &quot; miguel , isn &apos;t the last last thing that you want to have on a fischaufzucht ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building extensiv , not intense .
this is a ökologisches network .
they eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the nature &apos;s better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that &apos;s not feeding their animals and a farm that measures their success on their predators .
it &apos;s also a fischaufzucht .
oh , and by the way , they shouldn &apos;t even be there .
they breed in a city 240 miles away , where the bodenbeschaffenheit is better for the nestbau .
they fly 240 miles to the farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles .
they &apos;re doing this because they can follow the gestrichelten white line .
seriously .
i introduced a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , &quot; miguel , fly 240 240 miles to the farm , and then fly 240 miles back at the night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me , as if i &apos;ve been quoted a song by whitney .
he said , &quot; no . you do this because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fischhaut . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this beißende , verkohlte flavor .
i almost never tell cooking .
and yet , when i tried it in a restaurant restaurant , they didn &apos;t tasted it at all .
she liked sweet , and it was as if you take a bite of the ocean .
i mentioned that to miguel and er .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s against the last defense before something into the body .
it has evolved over the course of evolution to unreinheiten unreinheiten . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no unreinheiten . &quot;
okay . a farm that &apos;s not feeding their fish , a farm that measures their success to success on their predators .
and then i realized when he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have unreinheiten , he &apos;s massive , because the water that &apos;s flowing through this farm farm comes in from the river .
it &apos;s a river that causes all the things that are rivers , these rivers are rivers that tend to lead to us , chemical pollutants , flow of schädlingsbekämpfungsmitteln .
and if it was fought by the system , and this leaves is the water clean , as it &apos;s hereingekommen .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm that ihre their animals , not only a farm that measures their success on their predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally eine , and not just for those fish , but for you and me .
because when the water herausfließt , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and they should do it , because this story , as romantic as romantic as romantic as romantic .
you might say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about barsch or fleischrindern .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one in which food actually taste well .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
we are not realisten , we &apos;re genießer . we are lover .
we love wochenmärkte . we love little familienbetriebe . we &apos;re talking about regional food . we eat organic food .
and if you say that these are the things that the future is good up there , and say , &quot; hey , people , i love pinke flamingos , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
may i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough calories to feed the world more than only .
one billion people are hungry today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of krasser inequalities in the distribution , not the gesamtproduktion .
well , i don &apos;t like this question , because she has the logic logic the last 50 years .
pflanzenfresser grain , schädlingsbekämpfungsmittel of monokulturen , in the monokulturen , to the earth , of fish , and all the time , all the time has said , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can that be ? &quot;
and that was the cause . it was the basic business business business business business .
we should call them what she is , a craft in abwicklung , a building , which is very quickly ökologisches capital , which enables the production of production .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our kornkammer is threatened today , not because of abnehmender zufuhr , but because of abnehmender resources .
not through the latest mähdrescher- and traktor-erfindungen , but by fertile land , not by pumps , but through frisches water , not by kettensägen , but by wälder , and not by fischerboote and nets , but through fish in the sea .
you want to feed the world ?
so let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed ourselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agrarindustrie-modell for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are obenan in it , and it never has something really good to eat .
instead , look at the ecological model .
this is that that &apos;s on two billion years of arbeitserfahrung zurückgreift .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
businesses , who are no worlds for themselves , who are instead of aufzubrauchen , businesses , instead of aufzubrauchen , rather than hard , farmers who are not only erzeuger , but experts .
because they are the ones who are also experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i will ever be .
you know , that &apos;s me right now , because if that &apos;s good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
now , if i want to näherbringen a sense of this is that the data of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of their parts , and instead of thinking , i want you to think about how we can use information so that patterns , and we can see that the trends that would otherwise not be visible .
so , what we see here is a typical sterbediagramm after age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pivot , and what i can do with pivot is that i can filter after a certain cause , let &apos;s say accidents .
and immediately i see a different pattern that makes it .
and that &apos;s because in the mittelbereich here , people are most active , and they are over here .
we can step out and see the data and see the data and see the data and see the data and cancer is the usual suspects , but not everyone .
now , if we go to further further , and we say , we say 40 years or younger , that accidents are even the main cause that people should worry about .
and who &apos;s true is true that this is true in men .
so you realize that it &apos;s looking at information and data in this way , very much of swimming in a living system .
and if we can do this for raw data , why don &apos;t we do it for content itself ?
so what we &apos;ve now got here is the titelbilder of each individual sports illustrated , &quot; which has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can just test it after my zimmern .
with pivot them in a decade in a decade .
you can dive into one particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now , when i look at this , i see athletes that appear in this copy and the sportarten .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong armstrong , so i &apos;m going to go on here all the way i &apos;m going to show you all the lance of the lance armstrong .
now , if i &apos;m just going to get a überblick überblick überblick , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the issue ? &quot;
so , i &apos;m going to take a step back .
now i see greg lemond .
and so you get an idea that if you turn into this kind of information , gezielter , large , wider , reinzoomen , rauszoomen , you don &apos;t just look for or not just surft .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
now , i want to do this idea a little bit further with something a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we took every single one , and it &apos;s reduced to a little summary .
it &apos;s zusammenfassung in a short übersicht , and a symbol for the area that it &apos;s coming .
i just show the top the top of the top of the hit .
but even in this eingeschränkten view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we have a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the government .
now , after i have elected government , i know that the wikipediakategorien , which are most of the time for time , &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single wikipediaseite .
that &apos;s just to see if you go back and look at the whole thing .
so , in a certain of these summaries , i can go into the theme of time , &quot; people of the year , &quot; and all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are regierungsbeamte . some of them come from science , some , less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss , and one comes from the musikbereich .
and interestingly , bono is a ted prize winner .
so we can jump and take a look at all the ted prize .
you see , we &apos;re on the web for the first time , whether it &apos;s a network , not just by side , but much more abstract .
and so i &apos;d like to tell you what else might be a little surprise .
i &apos;m just going to show you just just the new york times .
pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s not a browser , but you can look at websites with it -- and we bring these zoom-technologie into every single website like this .
so i can go back to a step and jump straight to a specific sektion .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s important because you &apos;re just looking at looking at the internet websites in this way that can look at all the internet-verlauf in the same way .
so i can zoom in in my course in my course .
here &apos;s the total demonstration of the demonstration that i &apos;ve kept here .
and i can kind of looked at everything i &apos;ve been looking at today .
and , when i take a step back and look at everything , i can neu my process in my course , for the course of my course , for &quot; nepotistisch &quot; looking for &quot; nepotistisch &quot; , right here , or here after live in places .
and from here , i can go into the side and get them up .
it &apos;s a metaphor that is used again , and every time it makes it bigger than the sum of the datenteile .
at the moment , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the curse of the informationsüberflusses .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head , so instead of walking from one to the other , start to many things to many things , and see patterns that the patterns that were completely hidden ?
if we can do this , then this past will be datenfalle , maybe a new source of sinnvoller information .
and , instead of moving in information , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we know , then we can even get weisheiten out of it .
so i hear , thank you .
i grew up with a gehörigen portion of science fiction .
in my school school , i went to school with the bus , every day an hour per day .
and my nose always had a book in a book , a science-fiction-buch that my thought of other worlds in other worlds , and i &apos;ve been entführte in other worlds , and i &apos;ve been looking deeply deeply in my tief curiosity curiosity .
and this curiosity also showed that i was not in school that i was walking through the forests of the forests , and walking and walked &quot; samples , &quot; collected , &quot; frogs and beetles and teichwasser and teichwasser , and looked at the microscope .
i was completely wissenschaftsbegeistert , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and explore the limits of the possible .
and my love science fiction seemed to reflect in my neighborhood , because then in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon , and we explored the deep sea .
jacques kelley came into our living room with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world full of wonder that we never had imagined before .
and then i think it &apos;s very good at that science-fiction-rolle .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since there &apos;s no video games , the whole line of video games had the whole imagery of the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we all had to do that at that time . if we read a book , we took the description of the autors , and projected them on the screen in our heads .
my response to that was drawing and painting by aliens , alien worlds , robots , raumschiffen and all the way .
i was constantly caught by the teacher at the time i , hiding in the textbook , herummalte .
creativity had to get out of it .
and something interesting happened . which was an interesting thing about jacques cousteaus shows was the idea of one of us in a totally unknown world here on our earth .
certainly , i would never reach an alien world with a spaceship . it seemed rather unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually enter in , here on earth , and she was just as fascinating and exotic like all of the things that i &apos;ve ever imagined when i read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 to come to diver .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the nearest ocean .
i didn &apos;t let me frustrated .
i nervte my dad , until he finally came up with a tauchschule in buffalo , new york , right on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my tauchschein pool in a pool of ymca in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got only two years later when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , in the 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 15,000 hours of water , 500 hours of it in tauchbooten .
and i learned that the world of the deep ocean , even in the flacheren oceans , so rich in faszinierendem lives , how we can really barely imagine .
nature doesn &apos;t know frontiers , in contrast to our own , kläglichen human imagination .
until the days , i feel deep awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love is holding the ocean , with the same intensity as ever and ever .
when i was doing a profession , as an adult , it was a profession .
this seemed the best way to tell my internal urge to tell stories , with my need to create images .
as a child , i drew books comic books and so .
so movies of the path were bringing images and stories . that together .
of course , the stories i &apos;m aussuchte from the science-fiction-bereich : &quot; terminator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
so , in &quot; abyss , &quot; i was able to connect my preference for the unterwasserwelt , and connect . &quot;
so my two passions passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; abyss &quot; : to solve a erzählerisches problem in this film -- and that &apos;s that we had to create kind of a kind of liquid wasserwesen -- you know , we know , griffen animation , you know , zurück .
what came up is the first computergenerierte soft-surface-figur that ever came in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t have a money , in fact , he didn &apos;t play a produktionskosten , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like hypnotisiert from the magic that went out of it .
arthur clarke &apos;s law is fortgeschrittliche technology , and magic is not different from each other .
so they saw something magic .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , it has to be involved in the filmkunst . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next movie , much further .
together with ilm , we created the guy out of liquid liquid metal . success was on how this effect .
and it worked . again , we created something magic , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we have a film a little bit more eingespielt .
from these two experiences , there was a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for filmschaffende .
so i started a company , along with my good friend of stan , who was at the time of the best make-up- and creature-designer , was called digital domain .
the basic idea of this company was that the phase of analog processes with visual printers , etc and the same with digital produktionen .
and then we did that , and we managed to have a competitive advantage for some time .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the creature- and character-design -- what we actually started the company in the company , too slowly .
i wrote this piece , &quot; avatar , &quot; which &quot; written in the avatar of visual effects , &quot; with the messlatte of visual effects , and expressive characters that were made by cg , and the hauptfiguren should be all cg , and the world should be cg .
but they put it very nicely , and the people in my company told me that we were not able to be able to do that .
so i shifted this , and i made this other movie over the big ship , untergeht .
i &apos;ve been selling it as &quot; and julia and julia on a ship , &quot; and it became an liebesfilm of magnitude , a passionate movie .
but i really wanted to hinabtauchen to the real wrack of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
and i &apos;ve convinced you , i said , &quot; we go to the train . we movies the real high .
we &apos;ll show it in the eröffnungssequenz of the film .
that &apos;s immensely important . it &apos;s a good aufhänger for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but that &apos;s what &apos;s going back to your imagination can create a reality .
we actually created a reality that in fact , six months later , where i was in a russian tauchboot wiederfand , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i looked at the real titanic through a bullauge .
it wasn &apos;t a film , no hd , that was real .
so that &apos;s really umgehauen me .
and the amount of preparation was enormous . we had to build cameras and light and all kinds of things .
and i fell on how much of these tiefseetauchgänge , a weltraummission .
well , they were also hochtechnisch and bedurften planning planning .
you go up into these capsule , you get into this dark , feindselige environment , where no hope of hope , if you don &apos;t make it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the same as if i was in a science-fiction-film .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
anyway from the part of the part of that has to do with curiosity and science , it was all . it was an adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that i couldn &apos;t give hollywood .
because , you know , i was able to introduce a creature that we could make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the fensters .
so at some of the following expeditions , i saw creatures in thermalquellen , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before , and for the science of time , when we saw them , they didn &apos;t find any words yet .
so that &apos;s what i got right , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my hauptberuf as a filmmaker in hollywood to ice and i &apos;m going to put in hollywood for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we looked at the bismarck , and they were exploring with roboterfahrzeugen .
we went back to the train of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which we built .
our intention was , hineinzutauchen , and looking at the inside of the ship , which was never done before .
no one had explored the inside of the wracks , and you had no means for that . so we developed the technology .
well , and i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a tauchboot , and i see planken , who are pretty similar here , and i know that once the band played there .
and i &apos;m going to fly with a little roboterfahrzeug of the ship &apos;s head .
i &apos;m just bediene it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt , as if i were physically in the titanic of the titanic .
this was the surrealste form of a déjà-vu , which i &apos;ve ever experienced . because before i was a corner , i always knew what &apos;s the same in the lichtkegel of the vehicle , because i went to the film for months when we made the film .
and the set was an accurate copy of the design of the ship .
so that was a very strange experience .
she was aware of that that you know , you know , you can use such a roboterhafte , and your mind , you can use your mind into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
it was really incredibly profound .
and perhaps a small view of what could happen in a few decades , if you have cyborg-körper to explore something or to do other things in all kinds of post-humanen , that i can imagine as a science-fiction-fan .
so , after these expeditions , we started what we saw down there , for example , for example , for example , for example , these tiefseequellen , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , these are sort of aliens , but here on earth .
they live with the help of chemosynthese .
they don &apos;t exist in the sunlight of the system as we do .
and this is how you see animals that are right next to 500 degrees , that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also very interested in weltraumwissenschaft , which was again , again , from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space , and i ended up with the people who are going through russia , go through the mission of the biomedizinische allem , and it &apos;s all drum , and then fly , and then fly to the international weltraumstation and take our 3d-kamerasysteme .
that was fascinating .
but then , at the end , it walked out there was that i took weltraumwissenschaftler into the deep sea .
i took them access to the world , astrobiologen , planetenwissenschaftler , leute , people who were interested in these kinds of extreme situations , and i took them into the vents , so they could take samples , take samples and test instruments and so on .
and we turned , in fact , but they were actually doing science , actually , in fact , in fact , weltraumwissenschaft .
and the circle of the circle between my existence as a child , as a child , and the practice in the reality .
so over the course of this exploration , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science . but i &apos;m sure you &apos;re certainly thinking , a director , you have to be able to be a leader like a schiffskapitän or something .
but i don &apos;t mind much of leadership before i get these expeditions .
because at one particular point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do this ? what comes out of this ? &quot;
these blöden movies are not giving us a money .
we &apos;ll just play the cost of the cost of fame .
everybody &apos;s thinking , i &apos;m between &quot; titanic , &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i could have the avatar on a towel on the beach .
i have all these films movies , these graphs , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re doing it for the challenge of the challenge -- and the ocean is the herausforderndste environment that there is . you &apos;re doing it for the entdeckerrausches , because of the strange connection that comes out , when a small group of people form a team .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who worked for years , and sometimes we were two to three months in a row in a row .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing that you have to be aware is because you &apos;ve been able to overcome a task that you can &apos;t explain any other thing .
and when you come back to the country , and you know , , &quot; we had to do it , &quot; we had to be working on the lake , &quot; then you can &apos;t explain the other thing . it can &apos;t explain it . it &apos;s like the policemen or soldiers , who have gone through something together and know that they can never explain it .
there &apos;s a connection , a comparison .
so when i came back to make my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i was trying to turn the same leadership , which is that you spend his team and respect the return of respect .
so , the dynamics really changed .
so i stood back with a small team in unbekanntem terrain terrain , and we did a new technique that didn &apos;t exist before .
incredibly exciting .
an awful challenge .
and we have been to a four and a half a half years of a right family .
it &apos;s changed my way of making films completely .
there were people who were like , we &apos;ve got these ozeanwesen really good nachgemacht and transportiert on the planet .
for me , it was more a prinzipielle way of doing my job , the actual process that has changed in the outcome .
so what can we get out of all of this ?
what lessons did we learn ?
i think first of all , the curiosity is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the warning of your team is more important than all the lorbeer of the world .
and i get young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice , how i can do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t schränke yourself .
it &apos;s others for you . don &apos;t do yourself for yourself , not for yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has a lieblingssatz , &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art , in the art and in the art , fail to be an alternative , because it guarantee a vertrauensvorschuss .
not an important project that was asked innovation was the risk of risk .
you have to be ready to take these risks .
this is the thought that i &apos;d like to give you to the way . failure is absolutely an alternative , fear is not a alternative . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and that may be surprised , because my vollzeitbeschäftigung in the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seed to make things that we have to invent and to deliver to the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for those people , exactly more important than any other on the planet .
klimaverschlechterung means that their saaten is not growing in many years , and we can rain too much or too little rain . things are going to change their fragile environment .
that leads to hungersterben . it leads to unruhen . it leads to riots .
so , climate change will be terrible for you .
and it &apos;s also very important for them .
in fact , if you could reduce only one thing that you could reduce price , energy would be far from the most effective .
well , the energiepreis is like the time .
in fact , the fortschrittsgesellschaft is based on energiefortschritten .
the kohlerevolution drive the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the elektrizitätspreis , and so we have refrigerators , air air , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s get the price in half -- we meet a new barrier and that barrier depends on carbon .
co2 reduces the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they summieren carbon dioxide , which leads to the temperaturerhöhung , and this temperaturerhöhung has some very negative consequences . effects on weather and perhaps worse , that the natural ecosystems , the natural ecosystems are not able to adapt to change , and zusammenfallen their systems .
now , the exact relationship between a co2-anstieg and the dadurch temperaturveränderung , and where they &apos;re going to follow , there are some questions , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certain ambiguity about how bad these are going , but they &apos;ll be extremely bad .
i asked the top-wissenschaftler several times , &quot; do we really have to come down to zero zero ?
is not enough half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is : until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a 3.5 feet of high truck , which has to be under a three feet , and then you can kind of quetschen .
this has to go down to zero .
well , we run a lot of kohlenstoffdioxid , about 26 billion tons .
every americans from 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and somehow we have to make changes that reduce it down to zero .
it &apos;s gone up so far .
so only different economic changes , it &apos;s affected , and we need to decrease from rapidem rise to zero to zero to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit , you know , co2 , you want to bring it to the left , and you have the number of people , of the service of the service of the service that every human being using the average energy for every service and the co2 , which is a unit of energy .
so let &apos;s look at a factor of one of them , and we think about how we get that to zero .
probably one of these numbers have to come very close to zero .
now that &apos;s fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
we first have the population .
today , 6,8 billion people live .
and it step at nine billion zu. to move on 9 billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the gesundheitsvorsorgung and reproduktionsmedizin , we could get it down 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we can see a slope for 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
it includes everything that we eat , clothing , tv , heating .
these are very good things , and armutsverringerung means to almost everyone on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could do abstriche and less use , but on average , that number will increase every year , and it &apos;s more than double that the number of services that per given one person .
here &apos;s a very basic service service , is there to be light at home to read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their schulaufgaben under the straßenlicht .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , is at least good news .
we have something that goes up .
because of different successes in the lichtsektor , through other autotypen , through new methods , there &apos;s many services , there are many services , some of their energy , to reduce 90 percent .
in other service , as making the manufacturing of düngemitteln : 56,000 -- &amp; lt ; &amp; gt : 05 : 58,000 , or luftverkehr , or luftverkehr , or luftverkehr , is a lot of smaller for improvements .
in all , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a factor of three or maybe a factor of six .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;re now from 26 billion to maybe allerbestes 13 billion tons , and it &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that will be emittiert per unit of energy .
it turns out the question , whether you can get to zero .
when they burn coal , no .
when they burn natural gas , no .
almost every herstellungsmethode for electricity today is co2 today , except the renewables and nuklearenergie .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energiewunder .
now , if i use the wonder &quot; wonder , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
i don &apos;t normally have a deadline that you need a miracle to a particular date .
it &apos;s usually going to come wrong and some people come up and some other people .
but in this case , we have to get vollgas and get a miracle in very short time .
well , i asked myself , how can i actually bring this out ?
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that die the idea of people here ?
i remembered me last year when i brought mosquitos and somehow like that .
so the idea became really tangible for you , you know , there are people who live with mosquitoes .
for energy , this was one .
i decided that this was out of making fireflies my diesjähriger to the environment .
so here &apos;s a few natural fireflies .
you told me that you don &apos;t bite . you don &apos;t even get the glass .
well , there &apos;s all kinds of spielereilösungen like this , but they don &apos;t bring much .
we need solutions , either one or several of them have to have an incredible amount of scale , and even though there are many directions that people are looking for after that , i really can see that i really can afford those big demands .
i &apos;ve left out the tides , geothermal , fusion and biofuels .
you might afford to do a moderaten contribution , and if you do better than i expect , it &apos;s great , but my punch statement here is that we need to work on all five of them , and we can &apos;t give up from them , because they have a significant problem .
let &apos;s first look at fossil fuels , combustion of either coal or natural gas .
what you may have to do there may be simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to get all the co2 that comes out after the burning , to capture , under pressure , and go somewhere and hope that it stays there .
there are some pilotprojekte that are going to get over 60 percent , but to get it to 100 percent of the co2 , and an agreement for the lagerung of the co2 is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the lagerzeitfrage .
who &apos;s going to make sure ?
who can actually guarantee , which can actually make a lot of billion than any kind of waste that you can imagine from nuklear- and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a hard problem .
next : nuklearenergie .
it &apos;s got three big problems . the cost , especially in hochregulierten countries , and the question that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human engagement , the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be solvable soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work .
the last three of the five i put together .
they are renewables , as they are often called them .
and also , even though it &apos;s great , you don &apos;t need a fuel -- you have some nachteile .
one is the energy density , which these technologies are getting dramatically lower than kraftwerken .
these are energiefarmen , and you &apos;re talking about many times more surface than a normal power station .
they &apos;re also based on these sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all day , she doesn &apos;t seem like every day , and the wind doesn &apos;t even get the wind .
so , if you have to depend on these sources , if you have a way , the energy , even if you &apos;re not available in times .
so there &apos;s big preisherausforderungen here , there &apos;s challenges . there &apos;s challenges , for example , for example , that the power source is outside the country , you don &apos;t only need the technology , you &apos;ve got to deal with risk that energy from where it comes from .
and there &apos;s the lagerungsproblem .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve made all sorts of batteries that are made , computers , computer phones , taschenlampen , for everything , and i have a lot of the electronic energy that uses the world , and i found that all batteries that we produce now are producing less than 10 minutes of gesamtenergie .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that becomes a factor of 100 better than the approaches to time .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
that &apos;s what happens when you &apos;re trying to get these unterbrochenen sources over 20 percent -- 30 percent of the use .
if you want to support 100 percent of it , you need an incredible wunderbatterie .
now , where are we going to go , what is the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project ? &quot; how do we get to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
in many , you &apos;ll say , you &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group , there are many people who have been engaged there .
and bill has multiple companies , among other things called esolar the great solarthermaltechnologien .
vinod khosla invested in dozens of companies in dozens of companies making the great things , and i &apos;m trying to support this .
nathan myhrvold and i funding a company that , perhaps surprisingly , the nuclear approach the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in nuklearbereich ; modular , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry a few times ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts around .
the terrapower-konzept means that instead of one of the urans , one percent , one percent , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about that for a long time , but you could never have modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , but there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that : yes , with the right materialienherangehensweise , it looks like this , it looks like it .
and because you burn that 99 percent , it &apos;s a lot better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s reactors as antriebsstoff .
instead of zerbrechen the head , they just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium will use gradually , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often described as a wandernde wave reactor .
that really solves the treibstoffproblem .
here &apos;s a picture of place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that gets burned today , which is called aufgebrauchtes uranium .
it &apos;s the u.s. hunderte for hundreds of years .
and if you get ozeanwasser cheap and just filtriert , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we have to achieve and then we talk about the zwischenschritt .
a lot of 80 percent reduction from 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in the poor countries , and still even agriculture , and hopefully , and it &apos;s going to be clean up to clean .
so to reach that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , their elektrizitätsgeneration completely .
the other note says whether we &apos;re using the null-emissionen technology technology technology , whether they &apos;re used in all the developed countries and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great important .
this is going to be a key feature of this zeugnisses .
if we go back from there , what should the 2020 look like ?
it should have the two elements .
we should use the effektivitätsmaßnahmen to get reduction on the way , and the less we emittieren , the lower will be lower , and the temperature becomes the temperature .
but actually this is the note for the things that we do , which we are doing not to the big reduktionen , just the same , or even less important like the other , which represents the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
so , we need to track with vollgas , and we can measure this , in firmenzahlen , in pilotprojekten and regulierungsänderungen .
there are lots of great books on this topic .
that &apos;s a book , &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david mckays energy energy without the hot air . &quot;
they &apos;re going to do it , and create a framework where this wide diskutiert , because we need to pay for all sides .
there are some things that needs to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very concrete wish is that we invent this technology .
if you just pick up a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , i could choose the president , a vaccine , or i could choose this wish , which is , halbierter energiepreis , without co2 , i would take this wish .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , it will be terrible between the long term , between the united states and china , between the united states and china , between the u.s. and rich ländern. , and almost all of the lives of these two lives will be a lot worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to use more research for more research .
when countries make themselves in places like koppenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should go back to these innovationsstrategie , and they would be shocked by the lächerlich small money that &apos;s going to be spent for these innovative approaches .
we need marktanreize , co2 , cap &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; trade &amp; gt .
we have to spread the message .
we need to rationaler dialogue and all the things that are being done by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand terrapower something better -- first , can you give us an idea of magnitude of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , all the major scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we only need a few 10 million . and even when we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s reasonable , you &apos;re only in the 100en million .
and the difficult step is that we &apos;re building the first reaktors of the first reaktors , to find another , and the place that is actually building the first one .
when the first thing is done , when he &apos;s done as i promised , it &apos;s all right , because the economy , the energy density is so different than nuklearenergie , as we know them .
so to understand right , it means building deep into the ground , almost like a vertical plank nuclear brennstoffs , that verbrauchten , and then the process starts on the top of the process , and then goes down to the bottom ?
bg : right . now , you have a lot of people , and many people who can go wrong . so , this thing where you can open it and hinein- it and hinein- or herausbringt , and that &apos;s not good .
but if you have a very cheap fuel , you can think of it for 60 years -- think of a pillar -- that you &apos;re buried , without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and burning for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a nuklearreaktor that offers a solution to the waste .
bg : yes . now , what happens to the garbage -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and put it into the next reactor and burn it down .
and we start by taking the waste that has already exists in those kühlbecken or trockenbehältern , that &apos;s our startbrennstoff .
so what these reactors was a problem , which is what we fill in our fill in our fill it dramatically during the process during this process .
but as you &apos;ve talked about these kinds of people in the world .
where is the greatest interest in what really do ?
bg : now we haven &apos;t put ourselves in a place , and there &apos;s a lot of more interesting for everything that was in russia , india , china , china -- i was here , and i was talking about the energieminister and talked about how this fits the energieagenda .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have made something in the direction .
this is a version of one thing that was made .
this is a more important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor , and some countries have built this , so anyone who &apos;s done a quick reactor , an kandidatat reactor for our first .
in your mind , is a place and likelihood of your life ?
bg : now we need one of these skalierbaren , stromgenerierenden things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to invent and then 20 years .
this is kind of the deadline that we have to follow , which we have to follow .
and , you know , terrapower , when everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could be easy .
and fortunately , there &apos;s dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds , the ones that , if their approaches to work for their approaches that are working for their pilots for their pilots .
and it would be best if it &apos;s a couple of things , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
after all the great possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
bg : a energiedurchbruch is the most important .
that would have been without the umweltherausforderung , but it &apos;s also so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but there &apos;s the modular method , which is a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid reaktortyp that seems to be a little difficult , but you might say that about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the nice thing is that a uranmolekül is a million times a lot of energy , like one , say a kohlemolekül , and so the nice thing that , if you can deal with the problems , and it &apos;s mostly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , which is the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in a liga .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to introduce notfallmaßnahmen to try to keep the erdtemperatur stable stable ?
bg : if you get to this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;ve had too much eaten , and just before a heart attack , what do you do ? you might need a herzoperation or something like that .
there &apos;s a forschungsrichtung called the geoengineering that deals with various techniques to verzögern warming , so that we &apos;d get paid 20 or 30 years longer for us .
this is just a versicherungsmethode .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t start to work on insurance the insurance because you might be lazy , you know , that you &apos;re eating , because you know , you know , you &apos;re going to save a herzoperation .
i don &apos;t know if you know that the importance of the importance of that problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have that , if things come up faster , or that innovation needs longer than we expect .
klimaskeptiker : do you have one or two sentences for you to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptic in very different camps live .
those who are doing scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there &apos;s negative effects that are going to do with the clouds that make things move ?
there &apos;s very , very few things that you can tell at all of which there is an opportunity in a million .
the hauptproblem here is like aids .
you &apos;re doing the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
and that &apos;s why , you know , if you know , if you &apos;ve got all sorts of problems , the investment is not so clear that the investment is not necessarily the worst scenario , you know , the ipcc report not necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world that are looking at ipcc and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry about us .
but my dream here is that if you can do it , and then the skeptic , you know , you know , you know , that it &apos;s not a carbon co2 , i wish it &apos;s no co2 , i wish it &apos;s done , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the co2 argument that when you &apos;re using all of this time and energy , you know , you know , you know , the armutsverringerung , the armutsverringerung of malaria , and so on that it &apos;s a dumb waste of resources to invest money , while there &apos;s better things that we can do .
bg : well , the actual spending for the research -- say , we should spend 10 billion a year more than you do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
it doesn &apos;t suffer other things .
you come up to big geldsummen , and you can disagree with reasonable people , if you have something that is not economic , and it &apos;s trying to fund that . for me , the most waste is happening here .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very , very quickly , and funded only the learning curve , and i think we should do more things that have the potential to be very much less expensive .
if the abstrich you get is a very high energiepreis , then you can only keep the rich up .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even lomborg thinks .
his new masche is now , &quot; why is this research not going to talk about ? &quot;
he still will still , because of his former stories associated with the skeptiker-camp , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why he gets the forschungsargument .
and this is a mindset that i think for appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , just like little .
bill , i think i &apos;m going to talk about almost all the people here when i say , i really hope your wish will be true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter was a design-wettbewerb called &quot; the marshmallow-herausforderung . &quot;
and the idea is pretty simple . vierer-teams , the highest freistehende structure with 20 spaghetti , about a meter tape tape , to build about a meter and building a foot .
the marshmallow must be up on top .
and , although it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s really hard , because it &apos;s really hard to collaborate work very quickly .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned it into a design-workshop .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops in the world , students and architects architects , even with ctos and architects , and there &apos;s something about that task , which allows deep sensations to the nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them with them .
and usually most people start with the task of the task .
they &apos;re talking about what it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to be rangeln .
then you invest a little time in planning and an organization -- drawing you know , drawing spaghetti .
they spend a lot of their time in zusammenbau structures .
and finally , shortly before you don &apos;t have time to have the marshmallow , somebody &apos;s taking the marshmallow , and you &apos;re very closely at the top , step back and say , &quot; ta-da , &quot; you admire your work .
but what happens is , almost always happened to be a &quot; ta-da &quot; to a &quot; uh-oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallows does is that the whole thing verbiegt and einstürzt .
there &apos;s a number of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh than others , and under the worst are fresh frische .
they lie , they &apos;re verwirrt , they &apos;re really confused and producing things .
and of course , there are teams who have the much more &quot; ta-da &quot; -gebilde &quot; and under the best are fresh graduate students .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told them , they don &apos;t only have the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be wondering is : how does this happen ? why ? what about those ?
and peter said , &quot; none of the children invest at the head of the spaghetti . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in machtkämpfe .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s that bwl-studenten were trained to find a real plan , ok !
and then it turns out .
what happens if you put the marshmallow on top the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s doing different is that you start with the marshmallow and you build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that you have the opportunity to repair prototypes .
konstrukteure recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of a iterativen vorgangs .
and with every time , the kids get directly feedback , and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance of working with prototypes is essential -- but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
the average for most of it is about 50cm , bwl-studenten , which half of them are a little bit more , but not much , kindergartenkinder are better than adults .
who &apos;s most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
three is the highest thing i saw .
and why ? because they understand triangles and sich-selbst-verstärkende geometric patterns are the key to build stable structures .
ceos are doing something about average , but it gets interesting .
if you put a exekutive in the team of the team , they become significant .
it &apos;s amazing . you look around and see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is this ?
because they have special skills of prozessbegleitung .
they lead the process , they understand it .
and this team that regelt , and in the work is going to improve the performance of the team .
added skills and skills and prozessfähigkeiten and their combination lead to success .
if you have 10 teams that are typical thing , you get about six , you have a stable structure .
i tried something interesting .
i thought , we &apos;re going to bring the pokereinsatz .
so i offered a $ 10000 prize for the winner .
what did you think about this design-studenten ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone had built a high construction , he would have carried the price home .
so is it not interesting that high wetteinsätze have a strong effect ?
we went through this exercise with the same students .
what did you think happened ?
now she understood the advantage of the prototyping .
so it was from the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there are tief-greifende lessons for us , about the nature of drive drive and success .
and you might ask : why would someone actually invest in a marshmallow-challenge ?
the reason is , i &apos;m going to help digital tools and processes to help teams to help make cars , video games , video games .
and what the marshmallow-challenge is doing is it helps you to identify assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a shared experience , a common language , or grundhaltung to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in , can go to marshmallowchallenge.com .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the marshmallows .
there &apos;s a schritt-für-schritt-anleitung there .
they find crazy examples of all the world , as people have to optimize the system and optimize the system .
there are also weltrekorde .
and the basale lesson , i think , is actually a sport sport .
it demands that we all of our senses on the task , and we think of our thinking about how our emotions and our emotions , in the challenge , in the challenge that we are .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is what it needs to take us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; -- to a &quot; ta-da &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s do we have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool machine , ted-artige machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everybody in this room have to go in .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here , and you can stay in here .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i &apos;ve asked my friends last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time when there was cars or twitter or &quot; america for the superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced you kind of &apos;m convinced that you could be drawn to wunschdenken .
and i understand .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a abenteurer .
it &apos;s because we don &apos;t go back on the planet , you move forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that we &apos;ve ever had on this planet , no matter what scale you are : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining krankheitsraten krankheitsraten .
there never was a time like this .
my ur-großeltern died when they were 60 .
my grandparents kept up with this number .
my parents are the 80 to the fersen .
so , there &apos;s better to be a nine at the beginning of my todeszahl .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child that &apos;s born today in new delhi can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
they have geformt the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we &apos;ve got them bezwungen . puff .
in the rich world there are diseases that exist in the rich world , millions of us are still threatened by one generation ago .
diphterie , röteln , kinderlähmung ...
does anybody know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are the successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try things out , look at whether it works , if it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the great achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s the whole good news , because there are some other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people on this world are going to bed every day .
this number goes up , and it &apos;s very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to verwüsten this world .
water , urbares land , rainforests , oil , gas , it &apos;s disappearing , and soon , and if we don &apos;t out of this chaos , we &apos;re going to disappear .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that it &apos;s not destroyed at the same time .
i believe that really , and no , that &apos;s not a wunschdenken .
but this keeps me awake at night -- one of the things that keep me awake at night , and we have never been able to wake up scientific progress .
and we were never able to be able to be able to do it , as well as we can .
we &apos;re at the verge of amazing , amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think we &apos;d have to go back to a time to find a time where we &apos;re fighting progress in which we have about these things of more powerful getritten than now .
people are hüllen in their belief , and they &apos;re so closely that you can &apos;t free them free .
not even the truth becomes it free .
and listen , everyone has a right to his opinion , even a right on his opinion .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
you don &apos;t have a right to your own facts , &apos; tschuldigung , you don &apos;t have .
and i took a while to figure out that .
so , about a decade ago , i &apos;ve written an article about vaccine for the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed to run up on resistance , in resistance , which is at the end of the most effective activity in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what i should do , so i just did whatever i do , i wrote an article and went on .
and so soon , i wrote an article about genetically changed .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i &apos;ve written an article about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that was &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why they thought molecules are in one particular sort of a random sort of a random kind of herumzuschieben in nature of nature .
but you know , i &apos;m doing what i do . i wrote the article , i went on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we &apos;re typing , we &apos;re on , we &apos;re eating food , that &apos;s okay .
but i was worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally i found it .
and that &apos;s because these fanatiker , who were crazy , they didn &apos;t even have fanatiker .
these were umsichtige people , anständige people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that brought me out ...
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as used to .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking about a little bit of them , with little quote , that &apos;s why progress .
okay , so there are reasons , and i think we know what &apos;s the reasons .
we have trust in institutions , authority , and sometimes science in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it should not be that way .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
chernobyl , bhopal , the challenger , vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , the us-präsidentschaftswahl 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we thought they were always right . so they were skeptical .
ask questions , ask , demand for evidence , they demand .
don &apos;t take anything like that .
but here &apos;s : if you get the evidence that you have to accept this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can say that from the reason that we &apos;re going to live in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen them , and hopefully i &apos;ll never see .
about 12 years ago , a story was published a story , a terrible story , which is a autismus-epidemie story , brought out of mumps , and röteln .
very scary .
hundreds of studies were done to see if that was true .
tons of studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious thing .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , in england , from sweden , and they were all the same , no correlation , no link , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we believe in anecdotes , we believe , what we see what we see is what we think of what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents from a regierungsangstellten that gives us data , and i understand that , i think that &apos;s what we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of it was devastating .
katastrophal for this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the impfrate are falling down .
that &apos;s skandalös , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what &apos;s happening is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do that .
so here &apos;s a guy ?
has one one in the audience ever in the audience ever in the audience ?
not very often happens .
in this country , in this country , it doesn &apos;t even happen in this country in the last year .
these are many deaths through measles , 20 per hour .
but because this is not what happened , we can be in denial , and people like jenny can be walking around and analphabetismus messages from platforms like oprah oprah and larry king king live preach .
and you can do that because it doesn &apos;t connect the cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
and he befreite us from one of the worst of humanity .
no fear , no qualen , kinderlähmung , boom .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul offit .
he just developed a couple of other people .
he can save the lives of 400- , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
now , that &apos;s good , except for paul walking and vaccines talk about vaccines , and says how valuable they are , and people could just stop jammern .
and he actually says that .
so paul &apos;s a terrorist .
if paul speaks in a public public school , he can &apos;t tell no armed wächter .
he gets calls at home , because people love to tell him that they know where to school .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
continue to keep them back , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we &apos;ve got in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon , children will die , because this is just a question of the numbers .
and they &apos;re not just dying of measles .
what about kinderlähmung ? let &apos;s do that . why not ?
i &apos;ve been written in a couple of weeks ago , and i said , i think i &apos;m a bit of schrill .
no one has ever said that .
she wouldn &apos;t do her kid against kinderlähmung impfen .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have kinderlähmung , and you know what ?
we had no kinderlähmung yesterday in this country .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe somebody &apos;s going to go tomorrow in a plane tomorrow in a plane , and just fly to los angeles , at the moment he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he goes and mietet a car , and he goes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to take one of these fantastichen ted-dinner here tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a lähmenden disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because this is how the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do that as if it &apos;s not .
we love to hüllen ourselves . we love that .
did you all take vitamins tomorrow tomorrow ?
echinacea , a little antioxidantium thing that helps you to help them .
i know you &apos;ve done that , because half of the americans are doing it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take an alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data is all the time .
they make their urine . they almost never do .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay for 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with them .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think , i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and that &apos;s not what we should . our health system .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing , and seelentötend itself , who can afford it .
so we &apos;re going away from away , and where are we going ?
we &apos;re walking into the arms of the placebo-industrie .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo-industrie .
but you know , this is really a serious issue , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars for it .
and i &apos;ve got all kinds of kleinen here .
none of them -- gingko , cheating , echinacea , betrug , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we give billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s cheating .
and you know what ? when i say that , people go back to me and say , &quot; what does it take ? let people do what they want .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the gesundheitsminister , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to not believe the evidence of the experts to mammography , &quot; or some krebs-quacksalber who wants to treat his patient with kaffe-einläufen .
if you &apos;re moving on these path , where i believe and magic and science and science , you get into a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
he brought 400,000 people to his people , because he was that red beete , knoblauch and zitronenöl are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can do the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of unnötiger deaths in a country that is worse than any other person &apos;s disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have . they always have .
now , the hirnloseste epidemic epidemic that we &apos;re in right now is this absurde struggle between the befürwortern veränderter food system and the bio-elite .
this is a idiotische debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything that we eat , every reiskorn , every branch , every branch , every branch , has changed by the people .
you know , there was no mandarinen in paradise .
there was no cantaloupe-melonen .
there was no weihnachtsbäume . we did it all .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of it doesn &apos;t work and some of it .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can make it more specific . and of course we can take risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people to increase their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we gentechnisch changed food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m hearing is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monokultur , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing , which is wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
we don &apos;t want companies to seeds .
and you know what my answer to this is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . we fix it .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge nahrungsproblem , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , patentkram .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
she &apos;s not even an idea ; she &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t allow us , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid , and it &apos;s a dead end , and it &apos;s holding millions of people from aufblühen .
you know , in the next 50 years , we have to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? genetically transformed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this verrottete stuff as for example .
maniok is something that a half billion people eat .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
it &apos;s just a bündel calories . it &apos;s it .
it has no nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists are building all of it .
and then people could eat the food and would not be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be chez panisse , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i can say is : why do we fight that ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to herumschieben genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our orders on greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice krispies , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to have time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we &apos;re not doing that , if we &apos;re doing so far , as we continue to do that , we &apos;re guilty about something that i think i don &apos;t want to be guilty about colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our , and we really have to do that .
so after that incredibly fun conversation , you might say , &quot; do you still want to go back back and go back to the future ? &quot;
anyway . i want that anyway .
at the moment it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can do this time machine on everything we want .
we can hinbewegen them where we want them to hinbewegen , and we will move them where we want .
we have to take these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go back to the time machine and go into the future we &apos;ll be happy to have done that .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned about it , what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo-effekt . it &apos;s strange that a magician is interested , it &apos;s because , you look at it as &quot; a deception that will be true to something true , if you just find enough about it . &quot;
so , in other words , in some studies , in a couple of studies , in a few studies of studies , and it &apos;s just because the person &apos;s thinking of what &apos;s happening , is a pharmazeutische or some kind of -- in the schmerzmanagement , for example , for example , if the patient , you know , you know , is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo-effekt .
it becomes a deception to something true , because somebody knows it .
so let &apos;s understand each other , i want to show you a basic idea , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least at least since the 1950s in the 1950s for children .
i myself learned him from the cub magic magic in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to explain him , and then explain him .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain him .
so , see what happens .
the knife that you can study , my hand that you can study .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my hand .
i push my sleeves back .
and to make sure nothing in my sleeves disappears or coming out of it coming out , i just will just wrist my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that no time moves anything . as long as i &apos;m here , i can &apos;t get anything into my sleeve or come out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open up my hand , and hopefully if everything goes well , the knife is going to be held by my bare physical physical .
in fact , in fact , in his place that i can shake it , without the knife herunterfällt .
nothing goes into my sleeves or comes out , no trickserei , and you can study everything .
ta-da !
now , this is a trick that i often beibringe young kids who are magic , because you can learn much about deception deception , if you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
so many of you know , probably , many of you here in the room .
this is what it works .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say that i &apos;m my wrist my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or coming out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m my wrist is that there &apos;s the real secret to the illusion .
well , in the moment , where i &apos;m going to take my hand on the back of you , so you can see it from the back of the back , and you see this finger here , just from where it was , where he was , in a position where he &apos;s so ausgestreckt .
great trick ?
there &apos;s someone sitting in the back there , who &apos;s not a childhood .
so , it &apos;s here . right .
and when i umdrehe , the finger changes his position .
and now you could talk about why it &apos;s a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there &apos;s only three fingers , because the mind and the way that it &apos;s finding information , it &apos;s not one one , two , two , three , but it &apos;s as a group .
but it &apos;s actually not here , and then i open my hand .
of course , of course it will be recorded there , but not through the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my zeigefinger , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing that i &apos;m going to get out of this movement is going to turn out of this movement , that the fingers itself .
i take it away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick you can show your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does that have to do with the placebo-effekt ?
a year ago , i read a study that really umgehauen me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and so that was an amazing thing for me .
so what it turns out is : if you offer a placebo in the form of a white pill , which is just a round , white pill that has a given measurable effect .
but if you take the shape that you &apos;re going to do , for example , to change in a smaller pill , and turn these blue blue , and shape these blue , and shape a letter , it &apos;s actually measurable more effective .
and that , although don &apos;t have any of it any pharmazeutische -- it &apos;s just zuckerpillen .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? it really freak me out .
but it turns out that &apos;s not everything else .
if you take tiny , it &apos;s more effective than every form .
a colored capsule , who is yellow in one end and on red , is better than a white capsule .
the dosage also plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is ...
and that &apos;s also a role game .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo-effekt , you have to reach into the needle .
right ? a syringe with a wirkungslosen -- a few milliliter substance of a wirkungslosen substance for a patient .
it creates a very powerful picture in your head . this is much more powerful than a white pill .
this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you a different time when we have a projektor system .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t seem as good as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and none of it has a really pharmazeutische property , and it &apos;s only our belief that we can make a stronger impact .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i guess something that is obviously a deception , and let &apos;s make it look real .
we know from the study that you have to reach the needle if it should go to the thing .
this is a 18 inches of hutnadel -- it &apos;s very , very spitz , and i &apos;m going to do a little bit of sterilisieren .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not damians &apos;s meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
now i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin and put them through them until they go back on the other side .
if you &apos;re übel -- if you drop out of it , if you drop out of it -- i showed this a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s a woman nearly .
so i &apos;m suggesting if you &apos;re going to übel very quickly , and look übel for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first sensitive part here .
you can see it the same thing , but you can also wegsehen if you want .
so , right here , right here , where my flesh starts , at the bottom of my arm arm , i &apos;m going to just make a little einstich .
i &apos;m really sorry . does this matter ?
and just a little bit of my skin , and it turns out the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in messertrick .
about it .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , right now .
i know what people think when they see that .
they say , &quot; okay , this is not so dumb and durchsticht itself , just to talk for a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and they say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this right . &quot;
people in the nebenräumen come in now .
so let me show you out there .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can herumdrehen .
sorry . if you &apos;re übel , look away , look , don &apos;t look .
some of the people back at the back of the back , or the ones that would be real impressive , but if it was real , it would -- you see , you see , here &apos;s a hole , and it would be really real , it would bleed . &quot;
okay , let me give you a little blood for them .
yeah , here it is .
i usually would take the needle out .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think , in this context , and with the intention of purpose to do a real problem , i &apos;m going to just leave the needle in there and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to meet a couple of the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward . thank you very much .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i have some people who have been published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there are a massive wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of glücks-coaching .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these tide of work , there are several cognitive forces , which are sort of a way to think about happiness .
and my talk today is going to be mainly about these cognitive ones .
that &apos;s true for laien that think about your happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out we &apos;re just as mess like everybody else .
the first of those fallen is a widerstreben , complexity .
and it turns out that the word is simply not a useful word , because we &apos;re using it too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could just be able to give it , but in the big and all this is something we need to give up , and we will have to take the complicated view of what &apos;s well-being .
the second case is about experience and memory and memory : basically between happy to be happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both zusammengeworfen in the idea of happiness .
and the third one is the konzentrations-illusion , and that &apos;s the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affects well-being without its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a story , after one of my lectures , who had a story , he would have heard a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and at the end of the recording , there was a fürchterliches kreischendes sound .
and then he added , really emotionally , which has ruined the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what was ruined the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of herrlicher music .
they don &apos;t count because he was verblieben with a memory , which was ruined , and the memory was all he got to keep .
what this really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and other people , in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s a erlebendes self that lives in the present and knows the present , capable of experience the past , but basically the present present .
it &apos;s the erlebende self , the doctor anpricht -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt now if i anfasse you ? &quot;
and then there is a erinnerndes self itself , and then there &apos;s a erinnerndes itself , and the erinnernde itself , and it &apos;s the one that makes the doctor to say , &quot; how did you feel at the last time ? &quot;
or , &quot; what was your journey for albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the erlebende self and the erinnernde itself , and the two of them is part of the glück of happiness .
well , the erinnernde self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we &apos;re doing stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we &apos;re allowed to keep from our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start micht with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who have a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful when this study was in the 1990s .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds above their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who from two has suffered ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b clearly suffered more suffered . his darmspiegelung was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient , had a patient , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients do that they suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient had a much worse erinnrung in the darmspiegelung as a patient b.
the stories of the darmspiegelungen were different , and because a very critical part of the story is , as it ends .
and none of these stories is very erbaulich or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is worse than the other .
and the one that &apos;s worse , where the pain was at the end of its peak , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their darmspiegelung , and too much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a b in erinnrung .
well , this is a direct conflict between the erlebenden self and the erinnernden itself .
from the erlebenden self , b has a schlechtere time .
now , what you could do with the patient , and we &apos;ve actually done clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually get the darmspiegelung of the patient by just the patient , just by simply putting the tube in a very much too much .
it &apos;s going to lead to the patient , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you have that the erlebende itself is a worse on your head , and you have caused that the erinnernde itself is a much better off , because now you &apos;ve given a better story about its experience .
so what draws a story ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that give us the memory , and it &apos;s true of the stories that we invent .
so , what &apos;s a story of a story of a story of umbrüche , significant moments and end .
it &apos;s very , very important , and in this case , the end of the end .
well , the erlebende itself lives on its lives .
it has moments of erlebens , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost .
i mean , most of our moments of our lives -- and i have this idea -- you know , you know , most moments of our lives -- and what means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them , in a month , it &apos;s about 600,000 . most of you don &apos;t leave behind them .
most of you are completely ignored by the erinnernden self .
and yet , you kind of get the impression that you should count that , during that these moments of life , our lives is happening .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we consume while we &apos;re on the world .
and as we would use them to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that erinnernde the erinnernde itself for us .
so we have the erinnernde self , and the erlebende self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is to deal with time .
from the erlebenden self , if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first one , then the average vacation is twice as good as the einwöchige vacation .
that &apos;s how it doesn &apos;t work for the erinnernde itself .
and for the erinnernde itself , itself is not much better than the einwöchige vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that a erinnerndes itself is different from a erlebenden self , time has very little impact on this story .
now , the erinnernde itself makes more than remember and stories .
so , when you have a patient , because if you have a patient , if you have a patient , because if you have a patient who &apos;s supposed to vote , then you have to choose , then that is that you choose that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be selected .
the erlebende itself has no voice in this choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think about our future as a experience .
we think about our future as a vorausgesehene memories .
and you can look at this , you know , you know , as a tyrannei self , and you can think of the erinnernde itself as one , as one , which is a kind of the erlebende self through experiences that doesn &apos;t need the erlebende itself .
i have the impression that if we do a vacation , that means that we are doing a vacation of erinnernden itself .
and that &apos;s a little bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how do we get from our memories memories ?
this is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of erinnernden itself .
and when i think about it , i think on a holiday that we did at antarctica a few years ago , which i had ever had , and i think , and i think , and i think i &apos;ve been thinking about how often i think i think about other people &apos;s relationship .
and i probably have some of my memories of this journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i &apos;ve ever opened the 600 of 600 pictures , i would have spent another hour .
well , this is three weeks , and that &apos;s the only one and a half hours .
there seems to be a disagreement .
now , i like to be a little bit extreme , you know , you know , you know , i have a little bit extreme , but even when you make more of it , there &apos;s a real question , why do we have a lot of weight on the verlgeich of the weight that we give experience ?
so i want you to think about a thought thought .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the urlaubs , all of your images will be vernichtet , and you get a amnestisches drug , so they &apos;re not going to remember .
now , would you choose the same holiday ?
and if you choose a different vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between the self and you have to think about it , because if you &apos;re going to think of this conflict , because if you think about time in time , you get an answer . and if you think of memories , you could get a different answer .
why we pick up the urlaube that we have a problem that we have a problem with a choice between the two types of self .
well , the two types of self throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one self .
so you can ask : how happy is the erlebende itself ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the world &apos;s lives ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the erlebenden self over time .
if you ask the happiness of the erinnernden self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this is not how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or pleased the person is when that person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
everyone who &apos;s not different to the study of happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers about well-being , which we &apos;ve made the study of happiness in exactly this way .
the distinction between the happiness of the erlebenden self and happiness has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separat .
the gallup organization has a worldwide survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started to learn about the happiness of the self .
and the main lesson that we think i learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how anybody &apos;s happy with his life , and it doesn &apos;t teach them a lot about how happy he lives and live vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about .5 .
what that means is that if you would meet someone and you would say , oh , father &apos;s a zwei-meter-mann , how much would they know about his size ?
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone will have life as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty on how happy he is with his erlebenden self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what the happiness is meant .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mainly to be happy with people who we like to spend time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but this is dominant .
so if you &apos;re lucky to maximize the most of the self , you &apos;re going to do very different things .
and the implication of what i &apos;m saying here is we should really not think of happiness as a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , a very short reason , another reason that we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t care about the same things when we &apos;re thinking about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not getting the correct answer .
if you ask that question , you think that people in california must be happier if you say , in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the erlebende self , and it &apos;s not very important for the nachdenkliche self , decides how happy people are .
but now , because the nachdenkliche itself is responsible , you can at the end -- some people could at the end of california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens with people who are going to become happier in hope .
well , your erlebendes itself will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think you &apos;re happier , because if you &apos;re thinking about it , you &apos;re going to be reminded of how bad the weather was in ohio , and you will feel that you &apos;ve made the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think clearly about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve told you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you .
now , when we were talking about a couple of weeks ago , they talked to me that there was a pretty interesting result that came from this gallup poll .
is this something that you can tell us , because you &apos;ve got a few minutes now ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
i think the most interesting thing that we &apos;ve found in the gallup survey is a number we didn &apos;t expect to find absolutely .
we found that in terms of the happiness itself .
if we were looking at how feelings vary income .
and it turns out that there is 60,000 dollars a year of 60,000 dollars a year , and it &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under 600,000 dollars per year in the year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year are people unhappy , and they become increasingly less happy , the poorer they are .
we get a perfectly flat flat flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw that flat lines .
what happens is , obviously , that money would give you a erlebnis-glück , but that lack of money would give you a lot of misery , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the erinnernden self , you get another story .
the more money you make , you &apos;re happier .
that &apos;s not true for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american endeavor , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
when people would take this befund seriously , i mean , it seems to make everything on the head , all of what we believe , for example , for example , for example , and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country , generally , would be going to take a befund as serious as seriously , and make policy based on policy ?
dk : you know , i think it &apos;s credit for the role of glücksforschung in politics .
the recognition is going to be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening , right now , in other countries , in other countries .
people are in the process that they should think of happiness when they think of politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to study erlebnis-glück , or whether they want to explore , so we have to study this discussion pretty soon .
how to increase happiness is very different depending on how you think and if you think about the erinnernde self , or whether you think about the erlebende itself .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , the next few years .
in the united states , you start to measure the erlebnis-glück of the population .
that &apos;s going to be , i think , in the next one or two decades of national statistics .
well , it seems to me , or at least the most exciting political debate is to be track about the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny kahneman .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is just as easy to save the world in the reality as it is to save in online-spielen .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including all of them , to spend more time with greater tollerer games .
at the moment we spend three billion hours a week .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week is not nearly nearly enough to solve the most most successful problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to improve that time .
i &apos;ve calculated that it takes time at 21 billion hours per week .
that &apos;s the first thing that seems to appear , so let &apos;s repeat it : if we &apos;re problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .
no , i mean really seriously .
why ? and this image is quite exactly why i believe that games are so vital for survival of the human species in the future .
this is a portrait by the photographer phil toledano .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play , so he was building a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classical words playing .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe some of the nuances in this picture .
you &apos;re probably seeing this sense of urgency , something fear , but also a lot of you very , really , really , really , very difficult to solve a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re also playing , you see a couple of nuances here that are going to go up to the top gezogenen , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show a surprise .
this is a player who is on the verge of what &apos;s called a epischen sieges .
oh , you know this . ok . so , we have some players here .
a epischer victory is a result that &apos;s so extremely positive , that they didn &apos;t even know that it was possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you do it , they &apos;re shocked that they actually are able to do something like this , that &apos;s a epischer victory victory .
this player is just a kurz victory .
and this is what we have to see on millions of millionen faces around the world , if we have to attack the barriers of the next century , the face of all the widrigkeiten are on the edge of a epischen .
well , unfortunately , we look at this face in real life when we look at difficult problems .
i call it the &quot; in life &quot; i &apos;m bad , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s me , like i &apos;m in life , i &apos;m doing bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied why we are better in play than living in real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good as play in the reality .
and i don &apos;t just get less successful , although that &apos;s about it .
we get in spielwelten more . i mean , i mean , in the context of motivation to do something bedeutsames , inspired with each other .
if we &apos;re in a spielwelt , i believe that many of us turn into our best version , any time and helpful to try to solve the problem , trying to solve the problem as long as necessary , trying to try and try again .
and in reality , when we &apos;re failing , when we hit obstacles , we feel often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel threatened . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or zynisch .
we never have these feelings , if we play games , just don &apos;t exist .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible to think , you know , you could not do anything ?
how can we transfer these feelings from play into reality ?
so i was looking at games like the world of warcraft that offers the ideal environment to collaborative problem-solving .
and i found some of the things that epische won in online-welten .
so first of all , when you get in one of these online-spiele , especially at world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters who are willing to give you a weltrettende mission mission , and immediately .
but not only a mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level in the game , right ?
so they do that .
they never get a task they can &apos;t solve .
but on the edge of their skills , so they have to do it , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and dreht . there are always a very important thing to do .
and there is lots of tons .
where they &apos;re going to go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to close their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that easy in true life , this feeling that in a fingerschnipsen of lots of lots of many employees .
and also there is this epic story , the inspiring story of why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve got to &quot; level up &quot; and + &quot; + &quot; + &quot; + &quot; 1 intelligence . &quot;
there &apos;s no constant feedback in real life .
if i &apos;m going to leave this stage , i don &apos;t have to talk , and + a crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in true life .
so , the problem of kooperations-online-welten like the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand on the edge of a epischen at any time we spend our time in these spielwelten .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of warcraft-spieler has spent 5,93 million years to solve the virtual problems of azeroth .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it may sound bad .
but to see it in the context , 5,93 million years ago , we started to go upright .
so the first peaceful primate primate .
ok , so if we &apos;re talking about how much time we &apos;re currently talking about play , it &apos;s just sense when you spend time in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also in appropriate . because it turns out that we &apos;re using this whole time to play , actually , to actually change what we do as human beings .
we develop in collaborative thinking , in fact , creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe .
if you look at this interesting statistic , which was published recently from the carnegie mellon university , the average boy was published in a country today in a country with online-spielen 10,000 hours to zum to the 21st .
so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number , for two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , 10.080 hours are the exact gesamtzeit that they spend in school , from five grade to the degree of high school , if you never have .
so we &apos;ve got a full parallelbildungsweg here , on the young people to learn what it means to be a good player , like everything else they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; überflieger . &quot;
so she know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of kognitivwissenschaft , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the mühsamen study of any subject to the 21st of life , we &apos;re going to get into it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what &apos;s most significant people in the world .
so what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are meister-spieler .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players doing ?
because if we could figure that out , we have never been there before human potential .
so many people have now in the world that we have to spend at least one hour per day .
these are our meister-spieler . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are pretty good in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the spieleindustrie developed konsolen to save energy and work on mobilfunknetzen , instead of the breitband-internet , so that players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is , what these games are doing .
here &apos;s the four things i found . the first thing that i found .
ok , imagine how extreme selbstmotivierung .
dringlichkeits-optimismus is the desire to do it immediately , to meistern , together with the belief that we have to succeed hope .
players always believe that a epischer victory victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to try and do the same .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in social nets .
there are a lot of interesting research that show that we like more like , after we &apos;ve played with them , even when they &apos;ve been übel .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone a game .
we &apos;re trust that somebody has time with us to spend the rules that the rules are going to be eingehalten , that we have the same goal and to stay in the process .
so this is allowing the zusammenspielen of bindungen , trust and with each other .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
glückselige productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s one reason why the durchschnitts-word of warcraft-spieler 22 hours in a week is playing , as a teilzeitjob .
the reason is that when we play play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard to work hard than if we &apos;re not doing anything .
we know that as human beings , we &apos;re going to work as human beings , when we do hard work .
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right job .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to become a part of awe of gebietender missions .
here &apos;s a hintergrundinformation to get into the right light , you know , you know , wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
the second largest wiki of the world , with almost 80,000 einträgen , is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
you &apos;ve collected more information about the world of warcraft on the internet than any other kind of the world .
they create an epic story .
they create an epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome , and players are super-mächtige , hopeful individuals .
they are people who believe they can change the world .
and the only problem is that you believe you can change the virtual worlds , but not real .
this is the problem i try to solve .
edward castronova is a volkswissenschaftler .
his work is brilliant . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in online-welten .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re a witness of not less than a massenemigration in virtual worlds . &quot;
and that from an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not as i &apos;m -- i &apos;m making games , i &apos;m a little überschwänglich .
so he says that , in fact , that makes sense , because players can achieve more than the real life .
they can make stronger social bonds as in real life , and they get more feedback and rewards in play as in real life .
so , he says , it &apos;s completely logical that players are in the virtual world in the virtual world .
i just agree with voice , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not optimalsituation .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years .
there are these ancient cube , from schafsknöcheln . you know ?
before these fabulous spielecontrollern , there were schafsknöchel .
and that was sort of the first of people who were developed .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the werken of the old greek , you may be familiar with this story , the story about how and why games were invented .
laut were playing games , in the kingdom , in the kingdom , in the kingdom of a famine .
there was such a great famine that the king of lydien decided to have a crazy idea .
people were terrified . people fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to herodotus , the würfelspiel and vereinbarten of a national strategy , you would eat a day . the next day , you would play .
and they would have been so very fascinating , and they were going to be so fascinating , and we &apos;re surrounded by befriedigender productivity that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to herodotus , they survive for 18 years , they survived that famine , and they were playing the next day and they were playing .
so , i think , we &apos;ll play games today .
we are playing games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we are playing games to avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , and everything that is not satisfying in the real life , and we &apos;re getting out of what we need to play .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
this is exciting .
according to 18 after 18 years , after 18 years , after 18 years , famine was not better . so the king , i decided the king of würfelspiel .
they shared the kingdom in two .
they were playing a würfelspiel , and they were able to get a epischen adventure .
they left lydien , and they were looking for a new home , and they had just so many people back to survive , and they were looking for the rest of an area where they could flourish .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest dna-beweise show that the etrusker , who later , the fall of the fall of the römische that have the same dna as the old lydier .
so scientists came up recently to the notion that herodotus &apos;s crazy story is true .
and geologists found evidence of a global abkühlung abkühlung that could explain almost 20 years , which could explain famine .
so this crazy story could vote .
you may actually have saved people through play by saving 18 years in games , and then they &apos;ve had these eingebung , and they learned so much about each other , that they learned the entire entire civilization .
so , we can also .
we &apos;ve been playing games since 1994 .
this was the first strategiespiel in real time in the world of warcraft-serie . that was 16 years ago .
they were responsible for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i say , we &apos;re ready for our own episches game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion spielstunden a week .
we should übereinkommen that half of us spend an hour of an hour , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world &apos;s problems in play ? &quot; and exactly that question , i have devoted to my work in the last few years at the institute of the future .
we have this flag flag in palo alto in palo alto , it &apos;s how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to imagine the best possible outcome , and then people make power to make this idea into reality .
we &apos;re putting ourselves around , and we give people the possibilities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you a little bit of three games that i &apos;ve designed to try and get people into your own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s a online-spiel where you have to overcome a ölknappheit .
you know , you know , you know , you know , if you &apos;re realistic to be realistic , and then you have a lot of oil , you know , you know , if you &apos;re realistic , and then you have to figure out how to make your real life , and then you have to figure out how to make your real life , if it &apos;s true , and we ask them to be blogging , videos or photographs .
we &apos;ve tested this game with multiple players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been tested them over the last three years since .
and i can tell you , it was an changing experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in an epischen adventure , and you &apos;re saying , &quot; we &apos;re going on oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going on .
find out how you could survive . most of our players have beibehalten habits in the game .
so for the next weltrettende game , we &apos;ve got a greater , higher target than just ölknappheit .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; superstruct &quot; at the institute for the future .
so , starting to begin to start , the calculation is that people have only got 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global aussterbungs- sensibilisierungs-system , &quot; of course .
the call for a call on sign , we have almost like a &quot; jerry-bruckheimer . &quot;
you know , jerry bruckheimer-filme , where it &apos;s &quot; dream-team , &quot; you have the astronauts , the scientists , the ex-sträfling and only together can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say everybody &apos;s in the dream-team , and it &apos;s our job , the future of energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players were playing for eight weeks .
they found 500 creative solutions that you can read when you &apos;re google .
and the last game , we get out of march three , and it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the award of social umgestalter , &quot; in 2010 , &quot; in 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in all around sub-saharan africa , and store a social scale .
we have a comic book for that . we have &quot; level up for regionales , wissensvernetzung , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in entwicklungsgebieten , which benefit from your own social project to save the world .
i &apos;ll come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what , do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we have not saved the real world .
well , i hope you agree that the players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we &apos;ve got all these superpowers , glückselige productivity , the ability to improve social nets , dringlichkeits-optimismus , and the desire to epischer .
i really hope that we play important games to survive on the planet on a planet .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design and play with me like this .
if i &apos;m going to go into the next decade in the next decade , i &apos;m sure that we can create the future for the future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let the weltverändernden games .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you what i &apos;ve been writing a few months in the writing of wired wired wired magazine .
i &apos;ve always been writing on writing , but i had the work of the text of the text , but i &apos;ve been working on the text of the text , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never been in my life in my life , which means &quot; disabled &quot; disabled .
i read them the post .
lahm , &quot; , helpless hilflos , hilflos , verstümmelt , verstümmelt , verstümmelt , gelähmt , geschwächt , geschwächt , gelähmt , altersschwach , altersschwach , altersschwach , altersschwach , erledigt , erledigt , and behold , and behold , and lo , and behold , lo , and behold , lo .
antonyme : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
i read the list of a friend loud loud , and i had to laugh , but i just came up to &quot; broke up , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t have any more weitersprechen , and i had to get to read and to read about this überfallartigen , and then , after this überfallartigen , and verbundenden emotional shock , emotional shock .
of course , this was a ausgefranstes , old synonym-wörterbuch . i just thought that the issue has to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early &apos; 80s , when i started with elementary school , and i started to build my sense of self outside of my family sphere , in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use a synonym-wörterbuch at the time .
i would be able to take this point seriously , i was born in a world that someone would be positive in a person who can be positive in any sense , but i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the chances and adventure i &apos;ve experienced .
so , at the time , i &apos;ve seen the online-ausgabe of 2009 in 2009 , and i expect that i &apos;m going to do this one .
here &apos;s the aktualisierte version of this eintrags .
unfortunately , she &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words under &quot; near &quot; is &quot; near &quot; , &quot; and &quot; healthy &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that put in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking , and how we see the world and people around us .
many altertümliche societies societies , including the greeks and the römer , really believed that the aussprache of a big force has a huge force , because what you say is , you know , can also manifestieren .
so , what do we really want to do -- one disabled people or a powerful person ?
you know , just as a child , as a child , to call a child , einzuschränken , and einzuschränken them , and einzuschränken them .
wouldn &apos;t it be more beautiful to open doors ?
a man who opened doors to me was my pediatrician dupont at the a.i. institute in delaware .
he &apos;s called dr. pizzutillo . a italo-amerikaner , whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t be correct correctly , and so he was called dr. p. .
and dr. p. was wearing very colorful flies , and it was just like the work with children .
and i found the time that i spent in this hospital just great -- to my physiotherapie .
and i had to do a single practice infinitely with this heavy , sort of , with these big , elastic bändern -- in different colors -- you know this , and i hated these tape , more hated than anything else . i hated them . i hated them . i hated it .
and imagine , i &apos;ve even got to negotiate with dr. p. , and so trying to stop these practice , natürllich without success .
and he was watching me at one of my practice -- these were just ermüdend and gnadenlos , and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so strong , powerful and young girls , you will just take one of these tape tape .
and if you create it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
so , of course , this was just a simple trick from dr. p. , so i &apos;m going to do the process that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that i didn &apos;t want to go in the second floor , but he actually brought me to see my daily eyes with new eyes , and it &apos;s been a new experience .
and i &apos;m going to ask myself today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful girl , made my sense of self , and i could imagine myself as an nature of nature in strong , powerful and powerful people .
that &apos;s just one example of many , how adults can make the imagination of a child .
but how many of the synonym-wörterbüchern examples of the synonym-wörterbüchern prove to us , our language doesn &apos;t make us a room to imagine what we all want to do is to allow each other to see themselves as a powerful people .
our language hinkt the social changes , which were triggered in many cases by a technological change .
now , of course , you can say that my legs , of course , that my legs , the laser-chirurgie of titan , and artificial hüftgelenke for aging bodies that allow people to get out of titan , and , of course , about the borders of titan , people will be able to have their own identity , giving their own identity to their own way to their own way to pick up in the world that they pick themselves .
so maybe this technological change clear more clearly because there was a other truth that there was that every human society and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt , is our biggest plus .
that &apos;s an interesting story , because people are always asking me , and i &apos;m going to say , this sentence for me , and i &apos;ve always been feeling very uncomfortable with this , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with that , and i think , and i think i started to understand why .
the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea is that success , or happiness depends on the idea of being a challenge , and as if my life was so successful , because my life would be so successful , i could move out of a prothese , or as people can get me with my disability .
but the truth is that we are changing , of course , that we are changing . of course , we are the challenge , of course , is the challenge , whether they &apos;re both emotional or emotionally .
and i &apos;m saying that that &apos;s good .
widrigkeiten are not an obstacle that we need to get to our lives to our lives .
widrigkeiten are just in our lives .
and i tend to see widrigkeiten as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s barely seeing , but he &apos;s constantly with me .
and i don &apos;t want to do that by no means that the effect of the impact of the kampfs of a person .
there are widrigkeiten and challenges , and these are just alllzu real , and each person , but the question is not whether we come with widrigkeiten or not , but how we get to it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people that we love to keep schicksalsschlägen , but they &apos;re also going to make sure .
and we don &apos;t really like to our kids , if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to get two things clear : to one of the medical the medical fact , and to be an amputation , and to the other hand , if i &apos;m disabled , or not .
and to be honest , the only real and permanent disability that i had to take apart , is that the world says , she can describe me with this definitions .
so in our desire to protect people who are on our heart , and they &apos;re really hard to say to the quality of the quality of the quality of life that they &apos;re expected , we need to watch that we don &apos;t make the key for someone to actually disabled .
maybe this is the way that we &apos;re looking at what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we fix that , for every single one a greater disability than the pathologie &apos;s office .
if we don &apos;t treat a person , and not all of his forces and opportunities , and recognize it , in addition to the natural struggle you might have to lead to the natural fight .
we have a person who has value for our society .
so we have to look at the patologie and look out and focus on all of the human possibilities .
most importantly , it &apos;s between the perception of the unzulänglichkeiten and our great erfindergeist , a connection .
we should not have these herausfordernden times or either , or either , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , to avoid them , should we go to the carpet , but it &apos;s about to recognize in the widrigkeiten opportunities .
i may be more likely to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome widrigkeiten , but that we &apos;re open to hug them , to hug them in the schopf , to use a kampf-ausdruck and even dance .
and maybe we create it , as something natural , stimmiges and useful and useful , and feel like not that way in their presence .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 . the birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin has written in my eyes , to something very true in the human mind .
i would use it so much , not the most powerful of its species , and not the most of its way , but not the intelligenteste of his way , but that could change changes best .
conflicts of conflicts comes creativity .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive and survive and aufzublühen , from the battle of the human mind , is determined to turn through conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation are the great capabilities of people .
and perhaps we know what wood we &apos;re carved out of , when we really tested .
maybe that &apos;s exactly the sense of widrigkeiten , a sense of ichs , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like that .
we can give widrigkeiten a new meaning that goes beyond hard times .
maybe we can see widrigkeiten as a change .
widrigkeiten are a change that we haven &apos;t adapted for yet .
i think the biggest damage that we &apos;ve done to ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
honestly , who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there are the usual . the typical thing . but not the normal thing , and would you really want to learn this poor , gray person , if you really would know ?
i think , i don &apos;t .
it would be great , if we could have this paradigm paradigm of normal against another one of the possibilities or the strength to make it even a little more dangerous , exchange , and so we can release the forces of very many kids and invite them to invite their very special and valuable skills into society .
anthropolgen found out that we &apos;ve always got people from members of our society to be useful and to do a contribution .
there is evidence that the neanderthals before 60,000 years ago , older people and people have been carried with severe physical injuries , and this may be because the lebenserfahrung in the überlebenskampf of these people was valuable .
they didn &apos;t even look at these people as and useless ; they were as special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went in the city where i grew up , in a lebensmittelmarkt in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing in front of a scheffel tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had shorts .
and i hear like a guy behind me says , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around , and i think this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , you know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you can &apos;t remember me .
when i first saw her for the first time , i pulled her out of her mother . &quot;
oh , so that .
and of course , it made it click .
this was dr. kean , a man who i knew only from my mother about this day , because , of course , of course , of course , of course , to my birthday , two weeks ago .
the doctor for pränatale diagnostics , my mother was a holiday , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without wadenbeine , and my feet had looked at them , and i just had some toes on this and a few toes on the other hand , he was the überbringer , that strangers had to be the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never be as flexible , like other kids , or you could never run an independent life , and since then you &apos;re just lying me down . &quot;
and i found that he &apos;s won in my entire childhood class , whether i was going to do with the pfadfindern of my entire childhood , no matter whether i had to errungen , or one of my sportlichen won , and he used these clips to teach his students , medizin-studenten from the hahnemann medical school , and the hershey medical school .
and he called this part of his kurses the x factor , the potential of human will .
you can &apos;t stress enough to stress how critical this factor is for the quality of life .
and he continued to say , he said , &quot; i learned that kids , if they didn &apos;t do anything else , and even if they get a little bit of support , if you get kids to yourself , then children can achieve a lot . &quot;
see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone deals with it , are two different things .
and i &apos;ve been changing in the course of time when they were asked me 15 years old , if i asked my prostheses to be out of flesh and bones , i wouldn &apos;t have a second .
i really wanted to be normal .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s what happens because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite that experience .
and perhaps this change could happen because i &apos;ve met so many people who have opened the doors , instead of looking at people who have been involved in me , or to give me an idea of an idea .
see , it really takes one people who show them how they can make their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate your own , internal forces -- the human mind is so empfangsbereit -- if you do this , and for somebody in a critical moment , open up a door , you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
they get them to open doors .
the real meaning of the worts &quot; wurzelt &quot; rise in the word &quot; educe . &quot;
it means something to produce something that &apos;s in one of them , the potential .
again , what potential would we want to do ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the &apos; 60s in the &apos; 60s , in the u.k. , a case was transformed in gesamtschulen .
they call this &quot; streaming trials &quot; in the united states , which is called &quot; tracking . &quot;
the students are divided by grades .
and the a student is going to be mündlich schwerer , get the better teachers , etc .
they then have over a dreimonatigen period of &quot; sufficient &quot; enough &quot; the note &quot; very good , &quot; they gave them , they were very smart , they were very smart , and after these three months , they really wrote einser .
and of course , it breaks a heart to hear the heart that the umgekehrt was just enough to say that they were enough .
and then , after the three months .
but just those who were still in school -- except by the students who had geschmissen school .
in fact , this study was that teachers were not eingeweiht .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they just said that they were the einser-schüler , and that they are the students with the grade , and they were taught them , and they &apos;re treated .
the only real disability is a mind that was broken , which was broken , no more hope , he doesn &apos;t have our natural natural , kindliche neugier. and our angeborene ability to imagination imagination .
but if we create it to support the human mind , continue to continue to continue , and others and other people around themselves and find beautiful , and then to be curious , then we put our forces really positive .
if a mind has about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new daseinsformen .
and the poem that &apos;s called &quot; the god , &quot; the god who is written , not the god , not the god of the name , not the god of the verbote , not the god of the verbote , but the god that all the time , he always says , he always says , come on , dance with me .
come on dance . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
suppose i said that in a few changes of their genes , a better memory may have -- more specifically and faster and faster .
or you want to be fitter , more powerful , more powerful , more force .
do you want to get more attractive and more confident ?
how about life in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who always have a lot of them .
what would you like most ?
what would you like to have if you could just have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see you .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose for a good memory ?
some more .
so how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to be a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is it just a fantasy ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been a andauerndes issue here at the ted conference , but today , i want to give you the subject of a doctor .
the great geneticists in the 20th century , t.g. dobzhansky , who was also a kommunikant in in the russian church , wrote a paper , &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make any sense but in terms of evolution . &quot;
well , if you &apos;re one of those who accept the biological evolution , you take their personal -- and maybe you can throw up a look at kathryn schultz &apos;s book -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and you might throw a look at kathryn the book that &apos;s wrong , because nothing in the other course of the speech is going to make any sense for you .
but if you accept biological evolution , what you think about : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other geltend , or is it ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i have a bush at all directions , because if you look at the edges of life , because if you look at the edge of the tree of these branches of these branches in evolutionary terms , they have lived success ; they have survived ; it has fitness fitness and fitness .
the human part of this busches , far at the end , is that what we &apos;re most interested in .
we are stuck from a common ancestor about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , maybe there was 20 or 25 different types of hominids .
some of them came and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130.000 years .
it seems like we would be fairly remote with the other parts of the tree of life , but actually to the largest part , the basic mechanisms of our cells quite equal to our cells .
is that you realize that we can use it and make the mechanisms of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human insulins , which is used to treat diabetiker ?
this is not like humaninsulin ; this is the same protein that &apos;s a chemically protein that is a chemically ununterscheidbar of what comes from the pancreas .
and as we &apos;re talking about bacteria , is that each one of us in our gut is actually more bacteria in our gut than cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , do you think , if antonio damasio says after your sense of self , you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful gastfreundlichen environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s feucht ; it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re all going to nutrition all the nutrients that you might want to do without effort .
it &apos;s a really lighter way for bacteria , with occasional gelegentlichen unterbrechungen of unintended , forced to the outcome .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they are important for their lives .
they help by verdauung nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionäres balance in a species ?
or are we determined to become something else -- something that might even better adapted to the environment ?
now , let &apos;s take a step back to the time in 14 trillion years ago -- the first signs of creatures -- the first signs of creatures , and perhaps three billion years ago -- the first mehr-zelligen organisms , maybe as much as 800 or a billion years -- and then the human species , which is what shapes in the last 130.000 years .
in this vast unvollendeten symphony of the universe , life on earth is just very short enough ; the animal kingdom , as a single weight , and the human life , a little notenverzierung .
we were .
and this also represents the unterhaltungswert of this speech , that &apos;s why i hope that d ate it .
now , when i was a neuling in college , i had my first biologiekurse .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love in love the power of evolution , and i found something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in einzelligen organisms , every cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to move on both of the cell .
but at the time , as organisms , things began to change things .
sexual reproduction comes in the picture .
and really importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , that genome is going to be entbehrlich the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the unausweichlichkeit of the death of the death of our body is going to happen in the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now i &apos;ve got to say , if i was a college-student , i thought , right , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed rather reasonable at the time , but with every year , it &apos;s got to my increasing question .
and i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , in las vegas , who in las vegas in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his hotelzimmertür .
he opens the door .
it &apos;s a beautiful spärlich bekleidetes showgirl .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super-sex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization as a doctor that i was a goal that i was a goal that i was going to be a goal of evolution than the goal of evolution .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to keep healthy .
i wanted to rebuild health for a disease .
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about copying the genome of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they are , and i &apos;m like booster rockets to send the genetic fracht into the next stage of the orbit to get into the sea .
i think we would all take the mood , the woody of all , to understand when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to reach through my work .
i want to reach by going to die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily prefer the longest life .
it &apos;s not necessarily the largest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution priviligiert the creatures that will adapt best to their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
on the ocean , there are bacteria there , and the hot steam , and the hot steam the hot steam , if fish were there , there would be a vacuum , you know , in a vacuum , yet , yet , and you have been able to make a bewohnbare environment .
so , what does that mean , when we look at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and especially as we go into the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a series of options .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reason for that would be , first of all , we &apos;ve been able to get a lot of genes that were otherwise had been rausgewählt , and they were removed from the population .
and secondly , we as a species , we have our environment that we &apos;ve been able to adapt to us .
and by the way , we go and around and around us , so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary , for the evolution of evolution , for evolution .
a second possibility is that it &apos;s going to be a evolution of traditional traditional species , of course , imposed by the forces of nature .
and the argument , here &apos;s that the wheels of the evolution are slow , but they are unerbittlich .
and so far the isolation that the isolation is , as a distant planet , it &apos;s going to be isolierung and the change of the environment that could produce evolution in the natural way .
but there &apos;s a third opportunity , a verlockende , fascinating and terrifying opportunity .
i call it neo-evolution -- the new development that &apos;s not just of course , of course , but led , and decided to make the decisions that we do .
now , how could that happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s start looking at the reality that people are making decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice , to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
so think if it &apos;s not only possible to choose the gender of their child , but they &apos;re also trying to make the body to cure the disease and prevent the disease .
what if you could do the genetic changes , to remove diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or beseitigen alzheimer &apos;s disease or strokes ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do it to make these changes in their genes ?
when we vorausblicken , these kinds of changes are increasingly possible .
the human genome project was in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2,7 billion dollars .
the following year when it was done in 2004 , they were able to do the same for 20 million dollars in drein until four months .
today , you can have a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome at a price of about 20,000 and in the room of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take a long time to be the reality that it &apos;s going to be giving the 1,000 dollars human genomes , and it will become increasingly available to everyone .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering for francis arnold and willem stemmer , two scientists , which evolved independently from each other techniques that encourage the natural process of evolution , to work faster , in a more efficient way -- which is called frances arnold .
a few years ago , the lasker-preis of scientists were given to the scientist for his research for his research in his research , and the manipulation of only four genes , and the manipulation of just four genes that cell , to get them back to a pluripotenten stem cell -- potentially in the situation that is potentially able to become any cell in your body .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that the human insulin can produce in bacteria can make viruses not only protection , but also to serve other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in a lot of vaccine that has been grown in the cells on the cells in the cells .
can you imagine something good that &apos;s coming out of tobacco ?
this is all reality , and in the future , it &apos;s going to be much more possible .
then just take two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change your zellen cells ?
what if you could change the sperm and eizellen or the frisch befruchtete to your children to a better chance to live for a gesünderes -- eliminating the diabetes , remove the hämophilie of the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to healthier children ?
and then the analytical technology , the same motor of science can enable the change to prevent disease , could allow us to adopt super-attribute super-attribute , hyper-kapazitäten , hyper-kapazitäten -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t we have the schlagfertigkeit of a ken jennings hben , especially if you &apos;re going to extend it with the next generation ?
why not have the fast muskelfasern muskelfasern that will allow you to run faster and run longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be unwiderstehlich .
and if we &apos;re in a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we will be transformed by alt-stil evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that might require the rule of 100,000 years , and we can get it into a thousand years , and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions where their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , or their grandchildren .
do we use these decisions to form a society that is better , the more successful it is more friendly ?
or are we going to choose selectively different attributes that we want to have some of us and not for others ?
are we going to form a society and uniformierter , or more robust and more difficult and vielseitiger ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to be facing .
and most of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom meistern that we will need to make these decisions ?
in the good way in evil , and before you might think , these decisions are going to be on us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine a portable robot that gives you übermenschliche skills , or another one , or another , that helps you to get up again and go to it .
in berkeley , in berkeley we call these robots .
they &apos;re not different than something you put in the morning , and that gives them to each other , and that &apos;s going to continue to increase their pace and help them improve , for example , for example , for example , their balance .
that &apos;s indeed the true of human beings and machine .
but not just that -- together , and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start to talk about the american soldiers , which is about 100 pounds on its backs , and it &apos;s the request that you should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- rückenverletzungen , 30 percent of them -- chronic rückenverletzungen .
so we thought we would embrace this challenge , and we would think that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you now -- or the human universal load .
soldier : with the hulc-exoskelett , i can carry 200 pounds over verschiedenartiges terrain , many hours .
the flexible design enables it to be deep to living in the room and höchst movements .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go and then increase my strength and resilience .
so , we &apos;re going to introduce this device with our industriepartner this device , this new exoskelett in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now , let &apos;s take our look at the rollstuhlfahrer , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there &apos;s 68 million people in the world , sitting in the world .
this is about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord who &apos;s blütezeit , in the height of their life -- &apos; 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 30s -- and the wheelchair was the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population whose number multiplied .
and the only option -- if it comes to a hirnschlag , or some other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and this is , by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since , as i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could begin to write a whole new chapter in the field of mobility .
so let me now introduce you to elegs that by amanda boxtel , which has been carried by 19 years ago , which has been able to run a result that they couldn &apos;t run more than 19 years ago .
thank you .
as i said , amanda is our elegs .
it has sensors .
his completely non-invasiven sensors in the crutches , the signals zurücksenden on our onboard-computer that is attached to her back .
these are also batteriepackungen , the motorantrieb is on their hips , as well as their kniegelenken that they move forward in this pretty much and very natural way .
i was 24 years old , and in bestform as a monströser , as a skiabfahrt purzelbaum .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every one of the movement .
not long after that , a doctor &apos;s a doctor , and he said , &quot; amanda , you will never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s steel every fünkchen hope of my consciousness .
anpassungsfähige technologies have been able to get me to go back to go back again , to go back and drive to drive hands .
but nothing was invented to go back to me , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we &apos;ve got all the potential to change life from future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for amanda here and all the rollstuhlfahrer , but for everybody .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m boss of a non-profit organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t bekämpfe the poverty , i als as a feuerwehr-hauptmanns in a volunteer , the fire .
now , in our city , in the volunteers , they &apos;ve got a hochqualifizierte berufsfeuerwehr , you have to be quite early on the brandstelle to be able to mitmischen .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer volunteer , and i had a fairly good opportunity to get into it .
but there was still a race against the other volunteers around the people who would be able to figure out what our task would be .
when i found the hauptmann , he had just a very serious conversation in a very serious conversation , which certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she stood in the schlafanzug and barefoot , under a screen out in the strömenden rain , while her house was caught .
the other volunteers who was just arrived in front of me -- we call him lex luther -- reached the hauptmann as first and was asked to go into the house and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was sprachlos .
there was some lawyer or vermögensverwalter , which was able to tell people that he could tell people that he went into a brennendes house to save a living creature , just because he was five seconds faster than me .
well , i was the next .
the hauptmann winkte .
he said , &quot; yum , you have to go into the house .
you have to go up to the fire , and you have to get a pair of shoes shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
now , not exactly what i hoped , but i went -- the stairs up , the hallway , on the &quot; real &quot; feuerwehrmännern , who at this point that at this point , and they were going to be able to get the bedroom in the bedroom to get a few shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey down , where i met my erzfeind and the loved dog .
we put our values out to the outside , where , not surprisingly , his much more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the feuerwache got a letter to the hausbesitzerin , where they &apos;re bedankte for the brave use of saving their house .
one of the things about everything : somebody had put them a couple of shoes .
and at robin hood , as a volunteer , i am witness of generosity and kindness in the big scale , but i also see the altruism and the muts of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so when i see myself in this room and see people who can either have achieved a beachtenswerten success , or on their way there , i &apos;d like to offer a memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait for making a difference in the life of another , until you &apos;ve reached your first million .
if you give something , you &apos;ll give it now .
they &apos;re using a park in the neighborhood , they have a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us a chance to save the life of a person , but every day , it gives us the opportunity to change one .
so they go on ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community to know the secret of the secret of mankind .
a place where women lead to the women who lead to sex with sex , and the game , and the game of the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not burning , or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their verwandtschaft .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the urwald of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees with our next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
now chimpanzees are known for their aggressivität .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of überbetont in the history of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
as chimpanzees of great , fear of einflößenden guys are being led to bonobo-gesellschaft females .
they really came up with this , because that leads to a ausgesprochen society society in the deadly violence , in the deadly violence .
but unfortunately bonobos are the least familiar with the primates .
they live in the depths of the kongolesischen , and the observation is really hard to be accessible .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness -- the scene of a violent argument for decades and almost almost so many lives of life in the world war ii .
it &apos;s not surprised that these destruction are the survival of the bonobos .
fleischhandel and the decline of the baumbestandes lead that you don &apos;t even fill the stadion with the verbliebenen bonobos -- and ourselves , we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a verborgenes laugh that the trees struck .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as a love instead of war , because they have häufigen sex , they also have sex partners , with wechselnden partners , and the rules as conflicts and social angelenheiten .
i don &apos;t say that , that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because the bonobos of the bonobos is more than kama .
bonobos -- like people -- love to make their lives long .
play is not just kinderspiele .
for us , and it &apos;s fundamental to be fundamental to the attachment of relationships and the care care care .
and we &apos;re learning trust and the rules of the game .
play increases creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you watch bonobos in the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human lachens , dance and rituals .
play is the kitt that beieinanderhält us .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i &apos;d like to show you some unique shots of the wild .
first of all , a ballspiel on bonobo-art -- and i don &apos;t think of fussball .
so here &apos;s a young female and males males in a verfolgungsspiel .
look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary origin of : &quot; she grabs him in the eggs . &quot;
only i think it &apos;s like i think it &apos;s not true .
yes !
so sexspiele are common , both bonobos in bonobos as well .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ideenreichtum that you &apos;re putting new elements in the game -- like the testes -- and also how the game has trust both challenges as well as it &apos;s a lot of fun .
but the game is a formwandler .
play is a formwandler , and it can take a lot of shapes , some of which are ruhiger , phantasievoll , curious , curious -- maybe to discover the surprise again .
and i want to show you , this is fuku , a young female , and she plays peaceful with water .
i think , just like you play , sometimes play alone , and we loten limitations of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us research and interact and interact , and the unexpected types that we form are the real breeding supply of creativity .
this is just a little vorgeschmack of the insights that bonobos give us into our past and present .
but they also have a secret for our future , a future where we have to adapt to the challenges that we need to move through greater creativity and druch cooperation .
the secret is that the game of the key to these skills is .
in other words , play is our anpassungsjoker .
in order to be successful in a unbeständige world , we need to play .
but are we going to do the best from our spieltrieb ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
bonobos and people are equally equal to life , their lives alone .
now , if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , maybe the game is at the nötigsten .
and so , my primatenkameraden , let &apos;s give you this gift of evolution , and play together as the creativity of creativity and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples , in middle 1979 , in exactly the same time , in exactly the same moment , every single time , a baby -- okay .
so two couples , each zeugt a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to use too much time , because you know , because , if you think all the time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
just imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , you can imagine that in a case , the sperm is wearing a y chomosom , which hits the x chromosome .
and in the other case , the sperm is wearing a x chromosome that meets the x chromosome .
both of them are überlebensfähig , both fire .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
most of my activities , i have two hüte .
under a hat , i &apos;m involved with the history of anatomy .
i was studied historikerin , and in this case , i study how people with anatomy -- that means human bodies , animal bodies -- as they were with körperflüssigkeiten umgingen , with körperkonzepten , as they thought about body .
the other hat i &apos;ve carried in my work is the activist , as a patientinnenanwältin -- or , as i say sometimes , as impatient lawyer -- of people , are the patient &apos;s patients .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have körpertypen the social norms .
so , for example , i &apos;ve been working with people who have twins twins , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve worked with people with zwergenwuchs -- so people who were very common .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with people who have their gender atypisch -- so people who have no average the average male or female körpertypen .
and as general term , we can use the word intersexualität .
intersexualität comes in many different forms .
i &apos;m just give you a few examples of the kinds of geschlechtsvarianten , which are not the male or female standard .
in a case , you may have somebody with a xy chromosomenbasis , and the sry gene of y chomosoms the protogonaden that we all have at the stage stage in the stage .
and this is why the testicles are on the fötalen of testosterone .
but because this individual are missing the receptors to see testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the testosterone .
and that &apos;s called androgenrezeptor-defekt .
so much testosterone , but no response to it .
as a consequence , the body developed more the typical of female course .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it doesn &apos;t take puberty until she hit puberty and their breasts , but they &apos;re growing , but they don &apos;t get their period , until somebody comes out there , that there &apos;s something different .
and they &apos;re doing some tests and find out that instead of eierstöcken and uterus , in reality , and that she has a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold this person for a male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , as men , in our bodies , have something called adrenalindrüsen .
they are in the back of our body .
and the nebennieren are androgene , which are virilisierende hormones .
most of the women , as i -- i think , i don &apos;t know my real chromosomenaufbau , but i think i probably have the typical -- most of the women as i actually talk about androgene .
we produce androgen , and we &apos;re talking to androgene .
the consequence is that somebody like i actually had a brain that &apos;s been exposed to more androgenen than a woman who was born with testes , and a androgenrezeptor-defekt .
so gender is really complicated ; intersexuelle are not only in the middle of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , in a sense , you can be distributed over the whole range .
one example , a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 man who was born as a boy , he had a friend , had sex with his girlfriend friend , lived as a man , and he had just found that he had just eierstöcke and had a uterus .
he had an extreme form of an angeborenen nebennierenrindenhyperblasie .
he has xx chromosome , and in utero , his nebennieren is so strong that they &apos;ve essentially made a male hormonumgebung .
and as a consequence , his genitalien male , his brain has been exposed to the typischeren male part of the hormonenspektrums .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody had anything .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he &apos;s inside the inside , that the doctors found out that he was in the inner female .
okay , just a quick example of intersexualität .
some people with xx chromosomes , something called ovotestis , which is eierstockgewebe by hodengewebe von .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason that children with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s zwergenwuchs or siamesische twins , whether it &apos;s been intersexuell -- of surgeons often adapted to the norm , isn &apos;t because it was for their physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why there are many different kinds of surgical surgical surgeries is made because they threaten our social categories .
typically our system is , our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomische of the impact of a particular identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is to be a woman called a female person , which is supposed to be said to be an african anatomy in terms of their own story .
so we have this awful vereinfachende idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body that &apos;s actually very different for us , it confused us in terms of these kategorisierungen .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas on individualismus .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of individualismus .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , the two people are born in a body .
so , in the last time , i &apos;ve seen most excited , the südafrikanische läuferin caster semenya semenya last year whose gender was asked in the leichatlethik world &apos;s world cup .
and a lot of journalists me with the question , &quot; what are you going to do , which tells us if caster is female female or male male ? &quot;
and i had to tell the journalists that there &apos;s no test .
now we know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not going to be a line between male and a female , or männlich and intersexuell and intersexuell and intersexuell ; we &apos;re tastächlich that line , of course , of course , as of course .
so , we have a situation that , where , as we have to say , we have to say that these categories that we have given to build these categories categories categories , which are very simple zuordnungen to create permanent identitätskategorien , much more unschärfer than we have imagined .
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
it &apos;s also true in terms of race , which it turns out to be much more complicated than our terminologie .
in our observation , we are in all kinds of unbequemen areas .
so , for example , for example , to the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what should we start with the fact that we &apos;re just different from them with a few nukleotide ?
as we continue to push our science , we get increasingly into a zone of unbehagens , where we need to recognize that the simplistischen categories that we had probably had too simple .
we see that in all sorts of different parts of human life .
one of the areas that we can see in our culture today , in our culture , in today , in the united states , are the struggle in the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about what &apos;s going to be a body to people , so that he &apos;s right than that fetal life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- maybe not as publicly as in medicine -- about the question , when someone is dead .
our ancestors used to be so hard to fight the question was dead .
they only kept a feather under the nose , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t been buried .
if she wasn &apos;t moving , it &apos;s buried buried .
but today , we are in a situation where we can take people lebenswichtige organs , and put them in other people .
and as a result , we verfangen with the fight with the really difficult question , when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation that we don &apos;t have as simple categories as used to .
now , you would assume that all of the things were going to collapse from categories like me .
i &apos;m political , i &apos;m verteidige people with unusual bodies , but i &apos;ve got to admit it makes me nervous .
to realize that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , are .
and it makes me come from thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this anspannung , i first have to take off , i have a big fan of the gründungsväter .
i know they were rassisiten , i know they were sexisten , but they were great .
i find that they were so tapfer and strong , and so radical in what they did was that i &apos;m going to look at the schmalzige musical 1776 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely to forget .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happened with the gründungsvätern .
the founding fathers were from my view of the original anatomischen activists , and that &apos;s why .
what she was doing was a anatomisches concept , and they were replacing it through another thing that was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
and as you remember , our gründungsväter the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very vereinfachten concept of anatomy .
the herrscher of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of geburtsrechts .
they had a concept of blue blood .
and they were the idea that people who have the political power , should have this political power , because of the vererbten blutlinie from a grandfather to son , and so on .
the gründungsväter gründungsväter wiesen this idea , and they were replacing them through a new anatomisches concept , and this concept said that all of the people were creating the same .
they nivellierten the playing field , and decided that anatomisch anatomisch the ground , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now , they made this part , because they were part of a aufklärerischen system , in the two things in common .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , the science grew up .
if you look at the story of the gründungsväter , clearly , clear that many of them were interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of the world .
they went away from explanations of explanations -- and wiesen things , like supernatural concept of power , back where the transmission on a very vagen is based on geburtsrecht .
they moved to a naturalistischen concept .
and if you look at the independence of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
they talk about nature &apos;s power to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they managed to give us a concept of common similarities .
and it &apos;s really prepared for the future movement movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did was great .
so what happened years after that ?
and for instance , for example , for example , is what the konzept anstrebten , which says that the gründungsväter , which says that is what we &apos;ve got is common and eierstöcke , as a matter of difference as a difference is not important enough that we should not have to have the wahlrecht , the right , it &apos;s right , etc , etc , etc . &quot;
and women are successful .
next was the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like sojourner truth , who darüber about it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the marschierenden rows of bürgerechtsbewegung , saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people in different color of color that are professions in terms of anatomische differences , again , successful .
we see the same in the behindertenrechtsbewegung .
of course , the problem is that , as well , we start to look at all the ground , we need to wonder why we need to be able to be engaged .
well , you want to know , i want to maintain certain trennungen , anatomisch , in our culture , in our culture .
so , for example , for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish to the same rights as one person .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take from the anatomy of the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that 5-jährige should have the right to give informed consent or to get married .
so there are some of the anatomische trennungen that make sense to me , and that we think , i think .
but the challenge is to try to figure out which it is and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re sense .
so let &apos;s come back to these two creatures that have been gezeugt at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in 1979 in 1979 the same day .
let &apos;s imagine one of them , one of them , three months of verfrüht , so she &apos;s born at the one june 1980 .
heinrich , on the other side is born , so he &apos;s born , so he &apos;s born at 1980 .
only because of the fact that maria &apos;s three months of verfrüht was born three months from three months ago , all kinds of heinrich -- the right to have sex , the right to choose the right .
heinrich , in all of this , not because he actually has a different biological age , just because of the zeitpunktes of his birth .
we &apos;re going to find other merkwürdigkeiten about what their rights are .
and if you think that he &apos;s male , you know , he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t say he &apos;s xy -- because you think it &apos;s male , it can now be moved in , which maria don &apos;t have to worry about .
on the other hand , you can &apos;t see the same states in every states , in all states , in all states , in all states , and get married .
heinrich can be married in every single state , but maria can only get married in a few states today .
so we &apos;ve got these dauerhaften categories in many ways that are problematic and questionable .
and for me , the question : what will we do , because our science of progress in the realm of anatomy makes that we have to say that we have to admit that a democracy that is anatomy based on anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time it feels like the science is autonomous .
so where are we going ?
it seems like our culture is a kind of pragmatic attitudes , &quot; well , we need to pull a line somewhere , so we pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught themselves in a very strange position .
so , for example , texas , texas , texas decided that there is to marry a man , that you don &apos;t have a y chromosome , and a woman means that you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people aren &apos;t tested on their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i &apos;ve been told you about the androgenrezeptor-defekt .
if we look at one of the fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his , &quot; i have a dream . &quot;
he says , we shouldn &apos;t tell people , &quot; your skin , but after the quality of her character , &quot; judge , and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , it sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how are you telling people on their charaktereigenschaften ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be so sure that i should be so able to admit , because i have to admit that i have a series of golden retriever , who are probably likely to make benefits more than some people i know .
i want to realize that i &apos;ll probably know some light labradorhunde , who are fundiertere , more intelligent and more mature decisions to make decisions about sexual sexual relationships as some 40-jährige that i know .
so how are we going to ask the properties of the character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and part of me wonder what if the content of a personality would be something that would be maschinenlesbar in the future -- by an fmri , could be made by an fmri ?
do we really want to go to this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is leaders to make thinking about the questions of democracy .
in our trying to do democracy , we did really well , and i think we would do good things in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like in iran iran iran , where a man who was drawn to other men , with death with death , because he &apos;s punished , because he &apos;s ready to participate in the case he &apos;s going to stay alive .
we don &apos;t exist in that way .
i &apos;m glad to say that we didn &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon who was talking about a few years ago , who had a few siamesische twins with hergebracht to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i telefonierte him , and asked him why he made these surgeries -- they were highly riskante surgeries -- his response , in his country , that children would be treated very bad , and so he had to do it .
i told him , &quot; well , do you have a political asylum in consideration , instead of separate you ? &quot;
the united states offer incredible ways to allow people to be that they are , without that they were going to change the state of will .
that &apos;s why i think we have to be leaders .
well , just to close , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about dads .
and i want to think about the possibilities of how democracy could look , or looked like democracy , if we could have seen the mothers involved .
and i want to say something that is radical , and i think it &apos;s a feminist thing that &apos;s radical , and i think that there could be different kinds of insights , which can be able to do different kinds of insights from different kinds of anatomy , when people use a gruppendenken .
because for years , since years i was interested in intersexualität , i &apos;ve been interested in research , too .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and operating in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from kulturübergreifenden studies is that women , on average -- not any , but on average -- rather , complex social relationships and the care of people who are vulnerable in the group of vulnerable to give a lot of attention .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i went to graduate graduate school , one of my favorite interest that was my interest in feminism knew -- i considered myself as a feminist , so it &apos;s still -- a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s feminism female female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about about gender aufzulösen about gender , so feminism is why feminism wasn &apos;t female .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought that it could be a little bit of weibliches in feminism .
that &apos;s called , it might be something , on average , which is the average brains , which is women &apos;s brains are different from what makes us care about hochkomplexe social relationships for hochkomplexe social relationships .
so , where the fathers were extremely bedacht to figuring out how individuals were protected to the state of the state , it &apos;s possible that if we were more mothers in this concept , we have more a concept of bekämmen , not just how to protect , but how we care about each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go into the future , if we have democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual bodies thinking about what identity is , and more about relationships .
so that if we &apos;re trying to make a perfektere connection , we &apos;re thinking about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with outfits .
i love every opportunity to get a different kind of farbenfrohes outfit , and you know , in the last time , to take pictures and take pictures and take pictures lately .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of flohmärkten on flohmärkten and in second-hand-shops .
thank you .
second-hand-shopping allows me to reduce the impact of my garderobe on the environment , and it &apos;s in my wallet .
i meet all kinds of amazing people -- my dollars for usually a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes a lot of my personal experience .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
am i going to be the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers , yes , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i &apos;ve been here with for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does someone do with so many outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought up seven unterhosen , and that &apos;s all .
unterhosen for the right week are all i did in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve bet that i would be able to do everything that i might want to do , if i first came to palm springs .
and since you have not heard of me as the woman who &apos;s here at ted in her underwear -- that &apos;s called this , i found a couple of things .
and i really want to show you my outfits for this week .
does that sound good ?
as i do that , i &apos;m going to leave you with some of the lessons that i think of whether they believe it or not to carry out of these abenteuern , nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the wire tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket has me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i &apos;ve carried in this whole week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiological impossible impossible to be bad gelaunt when you wear hellrote pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you are happy people .
tuesday : adaptation is totally überbewertet .
i spent a lot of time in my life to try and to be myself and adapt to adapt at the same time .
just be who they are .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , you won &apos;t just understand it , you &apos;ll appreciate it .
wednesday wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people tell me , as if i put up in &apos; games , or i remember , or i remember to get them .
i like smile , and i say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at them , you know , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think you don &apos;t look good in something , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother teaching me the day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that briefly .
if you believe that you &apos;re a wonderful person on the outside , there &apos;s nothing that you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to rocken everything that we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : goldene pailleten to everything .
and finally , on saturday , one of our own personal , personal style is a great way of developing the world something about one without having to say a word .
it was always proven to me and over again , when people got to me in this week , just because of what i was wearing . and i had great conversations .
obviously that &apos;s not going to fit into my tiny suitcase suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to give you all this .
because the lesson that i try to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to really have these things emotionally , because the corner is always going to be a different verrücktes , farbenfrohes , farbenfrohes outfit , just waiting for me when i love a little bit of love , and i &apos;m looking for it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as a bildpunkt flying bildpunkt .
this is what we call in our lab , wahrnehmbares design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy grows with this picture , but the reason i &apos;m going to show you this is in the formula one in the formula , something very interesting happened in the past decades .
a while ago , it was that if you wanted to win a formula 1 race , they took their budget , and they put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , she won the race .
now , if you want to win a race , something like this -- something like this -- something like this -- something like this -- something like this -- something like this -- something like this -- a couple of sensors on the network of the car , and it &apos;s going to pass on the system , and then they use that to make decisions back and make things back in real time in real time .
this would call them , in ingenieurteams , call a echtzeit-kontrollsystem .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that comes from two parts -- a spürenden part and a reagierendenteil .
what &apos;s interesting today is the most interesting thing to come up in our lives .
our cities were , in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
they become computers in free .
and when computers in free , they start to respond to other ways , they &apos;re perceived and driven .
when we herrichten cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
just by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s earth , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energiekonsums -- cause 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
beyond the cities , all this is understanding and power in objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition , paola antonelli for moma later , during the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
now , all of our objects , our environment , begin to talk to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like every atom any atom is out there , a sensor and a antreiber .
and this is changing the interaction that we have people out of our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as a michelangelo formed the moses , it means that he took the hammer , and it said it on moses -- you can still see a little bit , and i said , &quot; perché non parli ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
now , our environment begins for the first time to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you a couple of examples -- again , with the idea of the environment and power .
let &apos;s start with that .
now the first project i &apos;d like to show you is actually one of the first of our labs .
it was about four and a half years ago in italy .
and what we did was actually to use one of the new kind of network that was used to be used in the world -- this is a mobiltelefonnetz -- and anonyme and aggregierte information from this network that are collected by the operators to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was when italy won the fußball-weltmeisterschaft .
some of you will remember , it was playing against france france , and then at the end of the zidane , the kopfstoß .
and anyway , in italy the end has won .
now , look at what happened that day , only when the activity happens that happens in the network .
here &apos;s the city .
you see in the middle of the kolosseum , the fluß tiber .
in the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline up .
afternoon , people here , and there , and there , that they are making calls and move .
the game begins -- silence .
france makes gate gate . italy does a gateway .
halbzeit , people make a short call , go on toilet .
second halbzeit . end of the normal .
first extension , second .
zidane , in a moment of kopfstoß .
italy wins . yeah .
now , in this night , all of the center to celebrate .
they saw the big important .
the next day , everyone went to the center for the siegerteam and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody down .
you see the image of the space of the space of circo massimo , where , since the roman time , you have to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the reality of the day at the end of the day .
well , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t .
now , again , another example of the sense : it &apos;s not about people , but things that we use and consume .
now , today we know all about this where our things are .
this is a map that gives you all the chips , which is a mac computer , how they came together .
but we just know little about where the things go .
so in this project , we &apos;ve actually designed some little markers in this project to pursue the trash as it comes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that have helped us to tag things more than a year in seattle , which they have helped to mark -- different types of things , as you can see -- things that they would just throw away .
then we have the little chips , the small brands , auf on the trash and started tracking him .
here are the results we have right now .
by seattle ...
after a week .
with this information we realized that there &apos;s a lot of ineffizienzen in the system .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but it &apos;s happening a lot of unnützer and more complicated things .
but the other thing is , we believe that if we see every day that the cup that we throw away , not simply disappears that she &apos;s still on the planet somewhere .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw away every day .
and if we &apos;d show that people , then we can push change change .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
and my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could tell you a lot more about this , and the many wonderful things you can do with sense , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we talked to the beginning , and this is the betätigung of our environment .
and the first project is something that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in zaragoza , spain .
it started with a question of the bürgermeisters , which came to us and said that spain and südeuropa have a beautiful tradition to use public places of water as part of architecture .
and the question was : how do you get technology to connect new technology with this ?
and one of the ideas that were at mit in a arbeitskreis ermittelt was , imagine these tubes , and the valves , magnetventile , work that open and close .
it &apos;s doing something like a wasservorhang with water .
if this bildpunkte fall off , you can write patterns , you can ads patterns , pictures of text .
and you &apos;re approaching it , and it &apos;s going to open up to make you durchspringen , as you can see how you can see in this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of belloch .
it was very much .
and we got the assignment to design a building the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was made of water .
there are no doors or windows , but if you &apos;re approaching it , it will open and open it into it .
the roof was also covered with water .
and when it &apos;s windy , if you want to reduce the syringes , you can even get the roof down .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture of architecture , like in this case , you know , if you get the roof , you get pictures of people who were there , and say , &quot; they &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t break the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost almost disappears .
here you see how the building works .
you see the person who is what &apos;s going on inside .
and here you can see me when i tried to test the sensors that opened the water , not get wet .
now , i should tell you what one night happened when all the sensors stopped working .
but actually , it was a greater fun fun .
all the children from zaragoza came into the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open to you , but a building , which still had the silence and holes in the water , you had to jump without wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as a designer , we always think about how people are using things that we design .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and this is the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical bildpunkten , the bildpunkten of water and the projections on it .
and this is what brought us to think about the following project i &apos;m going to show you now .
so imagine these bildpunkte could actually start flying .
imagine you could have little helicopter that fly through the air , and each of you with a little bildpunkt of light with wechselndem light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter like this that you saw earlier that you &apos;ve seen with others , absolutely in synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexiblen screen or display , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
but irregular , in three dimensions , where what changes , the light is not the position of bildpunkte .
you can play with different ways .
imagine before the screen , you could just appear in different formaten or sizes , in different auflösungen .
but then all this could only be a 3d cloud of bildpunkten that they can go to , and through them that they can move through , they can look at them in many , many directions .
and here you see a real flyfire-steuerung , the herabsinkt in order to form a gleichmäßiges v .
if you turn the light on , it looks like this . so , as we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people will be controlled .
it could have a impulse for every single bildpunkt , which is coming from people , from the movements of people or so forth .
i &apos;d like to show you something here .
we &apos;ve been working with roberto bolle , one of the best balletttänzer of our time -- the étoile at the metropolitan theater in new york and the scala of scala -- we &apos;ve taken his movements in 3d to use it a impulse for the flyfire .
here you see roberto dancing .
on the left side , you see the bildpunkte , the different eingefangenen sensations .
it &apos;s at the same time and a bewegungsaufnahme .
so they can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we all have bildpunkte , they can play with it and play with color and play with color .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impulse for the flyfire .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we work for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is , imagine that we &apos;re doing this , again , to change the environment , and change the environment -- almost like we call it , as we call it , , as a scheunentor , but with a cloud , but with a cloud .
imagine that everybody can give a little donation to a bildpunkt .
i think that the remarkable thing that happened in the events that happened last decades , that we &apos;ve changed from a physical world to a digital world .
it has digitized everything , knowledge , and makes it available through the internet .
today , we can for the first time -- and the campaign the president has shown that -- we can go from the digital world , from the digital world , to change selbstorganisierenden forces of the networks of the physical world .
that can be , in our case , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is what &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can take us to ask the coming challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we move from the digital world to the physical world .
so the idea is that , actually , we think of the people , in fact , in which they &apos;re doing things together .
the cloud is again a cloud of bildpunkten , in the same way like a cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of bildpunkten .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but covered with bildpunkten .
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at them at the bottom , the most important moments of olympia 2012 and more , and it &apos;s the kind of connection to community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go to the top of london in london .
you can get inside .
and a kind of a digital leuchtturm in the night -- but as a allerwichtigstes , a new kind of experience for all that want to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , the relationship is very important to me .
through my work , i try to argue that people are not separated from nature , and that everything is connected .
the first time i was about almost 10 years ago in antarctica where i saw my first eisberge .
and i did awe .
my heart raste , i was schwindelig while i was trying to grab what i was standing .
the eisberge around me almost 60 meters of the water , and i could just wonder that this was a snowflake on a different snowflake , year .
eisberge are born as a calf of a glacier or by indem out of eisschollen .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they interact in clear ways with their environment and their experiences .
some refuse to give up and klammern to give up to the bitter end , while others are not able to be able to stand and make more dramatic passion in a anfall .
when you look at a iceberg , you &apos;re thinking that they &apos;re isolated , separate , and alone , as we can see people .
but the truth is far away .
as a iceberg melt , i atme his vorzeitliche atmosphere .
in the iceberg , he puts mineralstoffreiches drinking water , which feeds a lot of life forms .
i &apos;m going to talk about this eisberge , as if i was going to make portraits of my ancestors in the conscious mind that they exist in those individual moments , and never exist .
it &apos;s not a death when it melt ; it &apos;s not a end , but a fortführung of their pfades along the life cycle .
one part of ice in the ice that i &apos;m photographiere is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last images i &apos;d like to show you to show a iceberg that i have in kekertsuatsiak in kekertsuatsiak in greenland .
very rare , you can actually witness a rollenden iceberg .
here you see it .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s in the wasserlinie .
you can see here , he &apos;s starting to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man stands there .
this is the average size of a grönland-eisbergs .
it ragt about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 feet .
and this video is real time .
and just like this , the iceberg shows a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really really blessed by working on some amazing projects projects .
but what i &apos;ve ever been working on is this guy .
his name is tempt .
tempt was one of the leading graffitikünstler of the 1980s .
then one day , he came back from walking back and said , &quot; paps , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of it .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i was standing with him .
i have a company that makes design and animation , so there is inevitably a complex part of what we admire and look at the world .
so we &apos;ve decided , tony -- tempt -- and to support his thing .
i met his father and his brother and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
i just want to talk to him , and i said , &quot; wait a moment , isn &apos;t that -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking -- can &apos;t communicate to all the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard about higher gesellschaftsschicht and a remarkable insurance , you can actually do that .
normal people are not available to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
did anybody see the movie &apos; and taucherglocke ?
that &apos;s how they communicate -- they &apos;re walking along their fingers .
i staunte , &quot; very archaisch , how can this be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need , just a check , and instead i asked a check that i didn &apos;t have the smallest idea of how i was supposed to einlösen it .
and i committed me to place to his brother and his father , and his father -- in the words , &quot; well , my proposal is : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;ll get a device there , and we &apos;ll find a way to find his art again .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s still wearing it is not able to communicate . &quot;
so i talked about a few months later at a conference .
i met these guys from grl , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to put light on any surface any surface , and then draw with a laserpointer , which only the negative surface is required .
so they &apos;re moving around , and they are kunstinstallationen like this .
they say all the things that are shown up there , they follow a life cycle .
it starts with the geschlechtsteilen , and then the schimpfwörter , after that , after that , in fact , people are doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in her presentation .
and i went home with my wife , and i said , &quot; well , second times , when it &apos;s the technology that you can use your eyes to control things , then we should find a way to control a laser , so that he can make him graffiti again , which would be great . &quot;
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we have done some things .
first , we have eingerannt the doors to eingerannt , and actually have a device for tempt a device that he can communicate -- a stephen hawking-maschine .
that was incredible .
and it &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him yoda , because you &apos;re talking to him , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so unwürdig , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and we also have seven programmers from the whole world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children and i pulled into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and verschwörungstheoretiker and anarchisten have taken over our house .
many of our friends thought that we were pretty stupid to do that , and we zurückkämen and all the images on the walls would be graffitis gewichen .
but for about two weeks , we have programmed , we went to the strandpromenade in venice , my children were involved , my dog , too , and we created this .
it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap sonnenbrille that we bought on the strandpromenade of venice , something kupferdraht and a couple of things , and a couple of stuff .
and we took a ps3-kamera , you &apos;ve got a ps3-kamera , and now we &apos;ve got a gerät , and now we have a device available -- you can build it ourselves , we make the code for free , the software you can download free .
so we have created a device that is completely free .
no insurance can querstellen .
no hospital .
so every paralyzed , every paralyzed can actually communicate with your eyes alone with your eyes .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so , at the end of the two weeks , we went back in tempts .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all of this rummel .
and after one year of planning , two weeks programmierarbeit , nudelparties and durchgemachten nights , tony , tony drew tony for the first time , again , tony years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support system .
we tend to see his bed so he can see it outside .
we made a projektor system against a wall of the hospital .
and he drew back to the first time in the beisein of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what was a feeling that was on the parking lot .
we also had to zurecht in the parking lot in the parking lot , so we felt as part of the sprüher-szene .
at the end , he sent us an email with following content , &quot; for the first time , &quot; for the first time , i did something .
i feel like that , i got under water and finally , and finally , and i finally put my head down , and i can breathe my head . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
this is something like our kampfschrei .
that &apos;s keeping us on the shelf , and that keeps us on .
and we need to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a zaubertafel .
and somebody who has a künstlerisches potential potential , deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re doing to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all sorts of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us .
it &apos;s all of our pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong twitterte over us and then , december , december , has been honored to us as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really neat .
the coolste is -- and that &apos;s the whole circle of april -- that april this april , in the city of los angeles , in the city of los angeles , is going to be an exhibition called &quot; kind of the art . &quot;
and there are probably the hardest representative of the straßenkunstszene of the straßenkunstszene -- banksy , shepard fairey , caws -- all these guys will be there .
tempt will be part of the show , which is quite abgefahren .
so basically , i &apos;m going to say , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then make it possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , that microphone , that microphone -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- all right here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never had something to do with augenerfassungstechnologie , but i just captured something and i was surrounded with amazing people so that we could put something on the legs .
and this question should be every single one of you , and that &apos;s the question of every single day where you have to do something that you have to do that , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , and if i don &apos;t , who then ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably the most of america &apos;s most gelesener kinderbuchautor kinderbuchautor .
and i always tell people i don &apos;t want to get a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody ever voted .
today i want to tell you about circles and offenbarungen .
well , an epiphany is usually something that you find because you left it somewhere .
you &apos;re about the block and it was as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard bollingbroke .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle of which i want to tell you today .
my circle started at the time in the &apos; 60s in stow , ohio , where i was the klassenschwuchtel .
i was the one who was the one week of green and blue and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by getting the toilet in the lehrerzimmer .
she did heimlich her .
she did for three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had a thumb , and i got to california in san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i found it to be a work on aids-organisationen .
about three or four years ago , i received a call from this teacher , woman post , who said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned each other as adults .
can you please come to ohio , and please come together with the man i know you &apos;ve found it now .
and i should say that i have bauspeicheldrüsenkrebs , and i want you to ask yourself . &quot;
well the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we cried , we cried , and we knew that she had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them ; we took them , and we took them , and we took them for their family , because it was necessary .
it was something we knew .
and just as the woman who wanted to learn me as adults , met , she turned himself into a box full of my hands , and was put into my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle , and the revelation of the revelation that i &apos;ve been talking .
the revelation is , death is part of the life .
she has saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs .
it takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this was so often mentioned here today .
he needs the same -- he would take , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a great explosion as it goes up at 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full smoke .
imagine a triebwerk engine , the klack , klack , klack , klack , klack , klack , klack .
that sounds angst .
well , i had a unique space on this day ; i was sitting on 1d .
i was the only one who could talk to the flugbegleitern .
so i looked at them right , and they said , &quot; no problem , we have some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already gewendet , and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot made the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
it turns out the engines .
imagine a geräuschloses airplane .
and then he said three words -- the emotionslosesten words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; bereitmachen for the hit . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk about the bordpersonal .
i could see it in your eyes , there was horror , the life was to end .
i want to share three things that i &apos;ve learned about that day .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
we have these lebensplan , we have these things we want to do in life , and i thought to all the people i wanted to do a hand , and it didn &apos;t , all the fences that i wanted to do , all the experience i wanted to do and never made .
while i was thinking about it later , i found a saying , &quot; i collect bad wines . &quot;
because if the wine is there , and the person is there , i open it .
i never want to move anything in life in life .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we were to bridge the george washington bridge , pretty much around haaresbreite -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing that i really did .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i &apos;m going to get better to everything i &apos;m anpackte .
but in my humanity , i gave my ego room .
and i bedauerte the time that i &apos;ve wasted for bedeutungslose things , with people who mean something .
and i was thinking about the relationship with my wife , to people .
and then when i was thinking about it , i decided i decided to verbannen negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i have no longer gestritten with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to be right , i &apos;m going to be happy to be happy .
the third thing that i learned -- it &apos;s like the inner clock , &quot; 15 , 13 , 13 , 13 , 13 , 13 . &quot;
you see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please flieg into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want to get this thing in 20 parts , how to know it from a documentary .
as we abstürzen , i had this feeling of being a person to die .
almost like we were preparing our lives for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that kind of sadness , really , really , in one thought , is that i wish .
i just wish i could grow up my children .
about a month after this , i went to visit a performance of my daughter -- erstklässler , not a lot of künstlerisches ...
... not yet .
and i feiere , i &apos;m cry like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made a sense to me .
i realized back then by the time i connected to each other , that it &apos;s only about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else is my single goal to be a good father .
i was given the wonder of the wonder not dying .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , and come back and live differently .
my call to everybody who flies today is : imagine the same thing happens on your flight -- please not -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
what would they do that they &apos;re aufschieben , because they think they would be there forever ?
how would they change their relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stuxnet computer-wurm is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want to make iran build the bomb .
the most important post for development nuclear weapons is the uran-anreicherungs-einrichtung in natanz .
the gray boxes that you see here are echtzeit-kontrollsysteme .
now , if we &apos;re able to control the systems that are drehzahlen and the valves , then we can actually make a lot of problems with a centrifuge .
these gray boxes are not running with windows-software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but when we create it that an effective windows-virus is used on a laptop that &apos;s used by a wartungsingenieur , to konfigurieren this gray box , then we are in business .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s planning behind .
so we start with a windows-dropper .
the nutzdaten are going to go into the gray box in the gray box , and iranian iranische in the verzögert .
this is a piece of cake , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started to stuxnet our research six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was completely unknown to the purpose of this konstrukts .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated what we knew about , very complicated , the dropper- part of the dropper- part , he made by an unzähligen of unzähligen .
and it seemed to be a little bit vorzuhaben , with these gray boxes , that echtzeit- kontrollsystemen .
and we started our attention , and we started a labor- project where we were infected our environment with stuxnet , and we studied this construct .
and then something funny happened .
stuxnet happened like a laborratte that was not liked our cheese -- schnüffelte , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we were experimenting with various types of cheese , i was on that this is an gezielter attack .
looking at a particular goal .
the dropper streift active on the gray box , if a special configuration was discovered , and even if the special program that &apos;s trying to get on this goal is going on .
and if not , it doesn &apos;t do anything .
so , that really got my interest , and we started working on it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it might , let &apos;s say , for example , for example , a us- american power station , or a chemieanlage in germany .
so we &apos;d better figure out what the goal is .
so , extrahierten and we found the angriffs- code , and we found that in two digital , in two digital , a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also realized they were constructed very professional , by people who obviously had all the insider- information .
they knew all of these bits and bytes that they had to attack .
they probably knew them the schuhgröße of the maschinenbedieners .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve realized that the dropper of stuxnet complex and high-tech is , let me tell you : the nutzdaten are a science for yourself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
so here &apos;s a clip from this angriffs- code code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
it looks pretty , altmodische assemblersprache .
and i want to tell you how we were able to become smart from this code .
so , first of all , what we were looking for was systemfunktions- aufrufe , because we know what that causes .
and then we looked for timern and datenstrukturen and trying to bring this with the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we &apos;ve been able or widerlegen .
so to make these theories , we call ourselves a reminder that it &apos;s definitely about hochgradige sabotage , it has to be a hochwertiges goal and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran , because most of the infections were reported .
now , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
it &apos;s basically going on the buschehr nuclear power power and on the urananreicherungsanlage in natanz .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all the experts for zentrifugen and power plants from our kundenstamm . &quot;
and i called them , and i called them , and to compare their expertise to compare what we found in the code and found in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring it to a little bit of digital sprengkopf .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulated the speed of this rotors , you &apos;re actually able to crack the lage and eventually to explode the centrifuge .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the response to the attack was actually to let it happen and unheimlich -- obviously in the attempt to try and have to try to leave , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get down quickly .
the big digital sprengkopf -- we got a glimpse of how we were looking at data and datenstrukturen .
so , for example , the number of 164 is very different from this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started making some scientific literature about how these zentrifugen are built in natanz , and found out that they &apos;re strukturiert in what &apos;s called kaskaden , and every kaskade contains 164 zentrifugen .
so that made sense to make it together .
and it was even better .
these zentrifugen in iran are divided into 15 so-called degrees .
and guess what did we find in the angriffscode ?
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
so again , that was really good together .
and this gave us big confidence for that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t understand me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just like that .
these results were done by several weeks of hard work .
and often we were just running in a dead end and we had to neu ourselves .
anyway , what we found is that both of the digital sprengköpfe is actually on one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little sprengkopf takes over a kaskade , and überdreht and verlangsamt , and slowed it and slowed up with six kaskaden in interaction and manipulated .
so , in the big and all , we are very confident that we actually determines what the goal is .
it &apos;s natanz , and it &apos;s just natanz .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other targets could be met by stuxnet .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- actually gehauen me .
it &apos;s the gray box down there , and on top of you see the zentrifugen .
now , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s the forces of sensors from sensors -- so for example , for example , for example , and it &apos;s available to the code code , and it &apos;s been on the falschen code .
and actually , in fact , this false daten data from stuxnet before .
so it &apos;s just like hollywoodfilmen in hollywoodfilmen , where the überwachungskamera is fed the überwachungskamera with vorher .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
so the idea of this is obviously not just nur in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressiver .
the idea is to überlisten a digital sicherheitssystem .
we need digital sicherheitssysteme where a human maschinenbediener can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power station , if the big dampfturbine is too fast , you have to open entlastungsventile in milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human maschinenführer .
so this is where we need digital sicherheitssysteme .
and if the risk are at risk , really , bad things can happen .
the power station can explode .
and neither the maschinenführer , it will notice it will notice .
that &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse .
and what i say now is very important .
think about it . this attack is generisch .
it doesn &apos;t have anything to do with zentrifugen , with urananreicherung .
so , for example , he would work just as well -- in a power station , or in a power station .
it &apos;s generisch .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the angreifer -- you don &apos;t have to put the nutzdaten on a usb- stick stick , as we saw it in stuxnet .
you could also use ordinary wurm- technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you get a cyber- massenvernichtungswaffe .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to ask ourselves .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the zielreichsten environments .
we have to put the consequences , and we &apos;re getting better ready to prepare .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it became a lot of thousands that people think the mossad is the hauptorganisation .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you want really to know ?
yeah . okay .
my mind is involved in my opinion , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the cyber- superpower .
there &apos;s only one and these are the united states -- luckily , to happiness .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for having a heidenangst eingejagt . thank you . thank you .
i spent the last few years to put myself in situations that usually are very difficult and kind of dangerous .
i went to jail -- hard .
i &apos;ve been working in a kohlebergwerk -- dangerous .
i filmed in kriegsgebieten -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days , nothing as this to eat here -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to the biggest part of a career of fürchterlichen situations , and all of the trials , and all of the time for trying to look at social , and it &apos;s interesting , and hopefully in a way of understanding what makes them fun for the audience and fun .
so when i knew i &apos;d come here to look at the world the world &apos;s world and look at the world &apos;s world , i knew i would do something a little bit .
some of you may have heard that i took an ad on ebay for a few weeks ago .
i would sent a couple of facebook-nachrichten , some twitter-nachrichten , and i gave people the opportunity to erstehen on my tedtalk 2011 .
and , some happy people and companies , for-profit and non-profit , and non-profit , got the most happy opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure that chris is never going to be able to buy the talk at the moment that you &apos;re not at that point at the moment that had a lot of content , and not a lot of evidence of what was supposed to be .
so , what you got was this : your name is : my name : my name , from which you have no idea about what is going to be the subject , and you could ever fly the ears for your ears , especially if i took their involvement for their involvement .
but again , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at this tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
this is just the arbeitstitel .
so despite that warning , i knew that anybody would buy the namensrechte .
so , if you asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you about it .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve gone in a few pretty terrible situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing was able to do something so hard to do something so hard to do with these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is a film about product placement , marketing and advertising , the whole film is funded by product placement , marketing and advertising .
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever ever sold . &quot;
so what &apos;s happening in &quot; the greatest movie sold &quot; is that everything , from the top to the end , is that it &apos;s a little bit -- from the titelsponsor that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s a brand x. .
now this brand , the qualcomm stadion , the staples center .
these guys are going to be connected to eternity -- forever .
and so the movie is going to study this whole idea -- this is what ? in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a redundante person .
that was more to emphasis .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the x as titelsponsor , but we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re going to sell every category in the movie .
so we may sell a shoe , and it becomes the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever carried ...
the greatest car that you &apos;ve ever driven from &quot; the greatest movie ever sold &quot; the greatest drink that you &apos;ve ever had to have a awareness of &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
so the idea is to show that brands are a part of life , actually , is a part of life , actually , to make the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of statten .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to end .
and i would love to be excited if ceg would help to do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how empfänglich people will be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use a perspective , because it &apos;s got a negative konnotation -- but you know how this is going to evolve ?
how much money is required to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth of every case , some really famous brands .
who knows when the movie comes out , we may look like a horde horde .
what do you think is going to be the answer ?
the answer is highly likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing about the film , or a difficult thing for me ?
jk : both .
so , it &apos;s not that optimistic .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands are .
yes .
if you look at the people that you have to do with ...
there are some places that we can apply .
imagine the camera .
and i thought , &quot; imagine the camera &quot; would mean that we wanted to lead a hintergrundgespräch .
it turns out that in reality , &quot; we don &apos;t want to have anything to do with your film . &quot;
and just so , all of these companies disappeared , all these companies disappeared .
no wanted to do something with the movie .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising was to present your product as many people as possible as possible , as many people as possible .
especially in the world today , at this intersection of new and old media and the media media landscape -- is not the idea of being in this new exciting vermittlungsinstrument , that the masses brings this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a fatalen mistake , and that was this .
actually , no , that was not the mistake at all .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this is the picture is a problem .
you see , if you put transparency transparency , this is one of the first images that seems to be .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
and that was the problem : transparency -- free and tücke , just to detect and durchschauen , just to detect , to be able to detect and durchschauen access to information , specifically -- the last line , the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re listening to a whole lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president said it , even our ceos say it .
but if there &apos;s the way that it &apos;s going to be implemented , something is changing .
but why ? well , transparency is fear of einflößend -- like this strange bear , who still brüllt .
it &apos;s unvorhersagbar -- like this strange landstraße .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is there risky ?
a dish &apos;s cool whip .
that &apos;s very risky .
so when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid and my father , and my father was caught me -- and he &apos;s looking at me with that -- he &apos;s going to say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the true version . &quot;
so , you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there &apos;s only one company that was willing to help us -- and that &apos;s just a company that i &apos;ve been aware of -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to go around the mittelsmann and go to the companies to the companies .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , is a broad problem .
i &apos;ve got friends , the big , giant hollywood-filme , and i have friends to do a little bit like i do .
and my friends , the big , giant hollywood-filme , say that the reason their movies are so successful is so successful in the markenpartnern that they have .
and then my friends , the little independent-filme , &quot; well , how are we supposed to compete with these big , giant hollywood-filmen competing ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the greatest movie ever . &quot;
so , how are we going to see ban movie ?
whenever i make myself on the way , and whenever i open the medizinschrank , you &apos;ll see ban deodorant .
and every time i interviewe someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
do you have you ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you calm up .
so , maybe you want to interview a little bit of this . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great düfte .
either &quot; floral fusion &quot; or a &quot; paradise winds , &quot; they will have choice .
we are being equipped both for men and women -- solid , roll-on , or a stick , whatever .
this is the kurzfassung .
now , i can answer all your questions and give you a ausfühliche version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
so as you talked about the smaller movies , we are a herausforderer .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so to make things like that -- you know , people remember ban -- that &apos;s somehow why we are interested .
what in words would you describe ?
ban is blank .
that &apos;s a great question .
überlegene technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone is doing under the achseln .
we talk about kühn , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category is really doing something positive , as opposed to &quot; fighting odor and moisture . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we hold them out longer -- better fresh fresh fresh fresh , frische , frischer frischer .
these things have an impact effect .
and this is a millionen-konzern .
what about me ? what about the druchschittstypen ?
i have to talk to the guy on the street , which are like me , otto-normal-verbraucher .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , your brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i love really like beautiful clothes .
&apos; 80s revival in skaterpunk , except at skaterpunk .
well , what is the brand gerry ?
unique .
i think the genre , the style that i have , is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of grautöne and such a stuff .
but i normally have a accessoire , like sonnenbrillen , or jewelry and such stuff .
if dan would be a brand , it would probably be a classic .
man 2 : the brand that i am , i would say , lässige fly .
ms. 2 : part yogi , part , part of brooklyn-mädchen -- i don &apos;t know .
man three : i am the schmusetyp .
i sell schmusetiere around the country around the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , verzerrten industry .
the man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was ausliefere .
mann 5 schreiberling alkoholsüchtiger schreiberling alkoholsüchtiger .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a anwaltsmarke .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the tom-marke , but i &apos;m very often seeing at the interface of glamour and lässiger fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who &apos;s going to go in my head , someone who really could help me understand what &apos;s called &quot; markenpersönlichkeit . &quot;
and so i found a company called olson zaltman zaltman .
they have companies like nestle , febreze , hallmark , helped to discover these markenpersönlichkeit .
if you were able to do it , you could also help me .
you &apos;ve brought your pictures , yes ?
this is what i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit like that with your thoughts and feelings about it itself .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about this world .
md : this world ? i think that &apos;s the world where you live -- like people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live your life , the work and so .
all these things come from the place and start from a place , and for me , and they start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what is it about the thoughts and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; -phase -- what makes us ?
what is the machete ? what puppenstadium are you currently ?
why is it important , neuzustarten ? what represents red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
it &apos;s a little bit more about you .
what else metamorphosen did they go through ?
... that &apos;s not going to be scared . what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to get out of it .
there &apos;s a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their markenpersönlichekti was two separate , but sich pages -- the morgan spurlock-marke spurlock-marke is a achtsame marke brand .
they &apos;re very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction .
and i think some companies are going to focus on a strength , instead of both of them .
many companies tend to avoid -- and this is the human nature -- and this is to avoid the things that they &apos;re not sure , these elements , and they &apos;re going to be afraid , and they turn them to yourself , and they turn them into something positive .
what other brands are like this ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can see here , you can see , target , wii , little coopers and jetblue .
now , there are verspielte brands and achtsame brands , these things that come and go and go , but an verspielte brand is a pretty strong thing .
a achtsame brand . what is your brand your brand ?
if anybody would ask them to describe their markenidentität , their markenpersönlichkeit , how would they be ?
you &apos;re a up-attribut ? are you something that brings your blood into wallungen ?
or are they more like a down-attribut ?
are you something that &apos;s a little quiet , reservierter , conservative , conservative ?
up-attribute are things that are playful , frisch , abenteuerlich , abenteuerlich , ausgefallen and lieblich , ausgefallen and agile and agile and agile , profane , herrisch , magical and mystisch like gandalf .
or are they more like a down-attribut ?
are they achtsam and mondän like 007 ?
is it built , traditionally , pflegend , beschützend , compassionate like oprah ?
are it reliable , stable , familiär , sicher , bedacht , bedacht and bedacht like the dalai lama or yoda ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies that were up up and down-firmen and the &quot; no &quot; no , &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but then 17 markenpartner , who were willing to get out to the control that was going to do with someone in business , and what i mean , and we finally , to tell us stories that we don &apos;t usually have to have -- stories that never would never support .
they befähigten us to tell the story of neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this film that today , you &apos;re used to be used to make the lustzentren of the brain , both and making advertising as well .
we went to sao paulo , where außenwerbung has been banned .
in the entire city for five years , it &apos;s not a poster , no poster , no flyer , nothing .
and we were in school school in school where companies are moving to their way in verarmte schools , in america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got to most of feedback , or where i had the biggest success , those are where i specialize with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
because they umgingen the mittelsmann , they umgingen the agencies , and they said that the agencies may not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people will challenge to think that our world challenges .
and how was this for you ? what successfully ?
now , because the movie in the sundance film opened , we can look at it .
according to burrelles , the first time was in january , and since , and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- 900 million aufrufe of this film .
this is actually just a period of a period of two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn &apos;t been ausgeliefert yet .
it &apos;s not even online . no streaming .
he &apos;s not coming out in other countries .
now , the film has a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every werbeagentur we were talking about , to their clients to make their clients .
something that i believe is that if you get to arrest a chance , you think , you &apos;re taking risks in these risks .
i think if you keep people from it , you get them closer to failure .
and i believe that if you have your employees to avoid risks , you get the whole company prepared to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people not to have a fear of ways that they might be verängstigen .
finally , in progress , we should welcome to the fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome to be the fear of fear the risk .
and each one of the great löffel , we &apos;re called the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , it brings to us a little bit of honesty .
and so that , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; they welcome transparency transparency , &quot; and they &apos;ve been willkommen transparency , from my good friends , who paid $ $ to the namensrechte for the namensrechte .
big data is turned into great opportunities for organizations around the world .
emc presents &quot; heißen transparency . &quot;
thank you .
well , morgan , in the name of transparency this : what &apos;s happening with the $ $ ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i &apos;ve got a check in my pocket , on the oberorganisation of the ted-organisation , the sapling-stiftung -- a check in the height of $ $ , to finance in the next year .
my name is amit .
so , 18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i regte to do something with museums and art , my chefin , and my chefin , which is today , i mean , gave me a green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of spaßiger negotiations and stories , which is what i can tell you know , 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the show .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very easy to explain this slide and access to this slide .
i grew up in india .
i &apos;ve been in a great education -- i didn &apos;t -- but i had no access to many museums , and i had no access .
when i went to traveling and visit these museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i worked for google , i tried to make this desire -- art is to make up with technology .
we then formed a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you &apos;re just going to googleartproject.com. .
you can in all these museums museums here .
there &apos;s the uffizi , the moma , the moma , the rijks , the van gogh .
i &apos;m actually coming in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
click , and wumms , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you go around and amüsiert .
you want to go in the museum ?
open up the map , and jump with a click .
they &apos;re inside , they want them to the end of the gangs .
just on . a lot of fun .
look around .
thank you , but the best thing comes .
so , i am in front of one of my favorites , erntearbeiter von in the met met .
i see this pluszeichen .
if the museum has given us the picture , you click on it .
now this is one of the images .
this is all the time .
those of you who are really interested in art , can click here -- but i go ahead now .
this is one of the images that we put on with the so-called gigapixel-technologie .
so , for example , this picture has about 10 billion bildpunkte , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
now , i &apos;m going to show you .
you can get very easily rein .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unbezahlbar .
but then they really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and realized that there &apos;s something that there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a moment , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went to get close , and slowly realized that kids actually beat something .
i was a little known , with some known known at the met met at the met , and it turns out to be a game called squail , which is a goose on a stick with a stick with a stick .
apparently it was very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned something about it .
to really get close to it , you can go to the rissen .
just to give you the überblick , i see what you see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is , but the best one second .
let &apos;s jump quickly at moma , again in new york .
another lieblingsbild of me , sternennacht .
in the previous example , in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the pinselstriche ?
and what if you want to see how van gogh is a masterpiece masterpiece ?
you go into it . you can actually go into it .
i &apos;m going to zoom into one of my favorite points of this picture , until i really am .
that &apos;s sternennacht , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s a lot more , but i &apos;m missing time .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called the collections .
each of them , everyone -- whether rich or poor , whether they have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go up and create your own museum online -- from all these pictures , you can put your own collection .
just simply , they go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of zoom -- you can umherzoomen .
this is the gesandten , in the nationalgallerie .
you can put it all up with comments your friends , and so a conversation start about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , the main thing that all the wonderful things are not coming from google .
they &apos;re not even from the museums .
i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re just going to do with this digital medium of art , and they represent ordentlich online online .
this is the biggest question that i &apos;ve been asked , &quot; did you do this to replicate the experience of a museumsbesuchs ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two camps .
this is the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure that every hemisphere of every hemisphere , we could visualize your brain .
for example , it would be somebody who is completely logical .
this would be somebody that &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you positionieren your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have some of those extreme , but i think that for most people in the audience , your brain looks like this -- with a high aptitute , which is at the same time in both hemisphären .
it &apos;s not as though they &apos;re both exclusive , or anything .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i look at one of the people , in common with most of the experimental quantenphysikern that have a good percentage logic logic to put together the complex ideas .
but at the same time , we need a good fraction of intuition to actually do the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love playing with things .
so we go out and play with this , and then look like it , and then we start to develop our intuition .
they basically do the same thing .
so one of the things that they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing can be just a place at the same time .
i mean , it can sound strange to think that one thing at the same time in the same time , but they were not born with this idea , they evolved .
i remember seeing a child playing on a bodenschwelle .
he was still a kleinkind and not very good at it , and he fell all the time .
but i &apos;ll bet it &apos;s been a very valuable lesson with the bodenschwelle , which is a very valuable thing , which is not going to leave you by simply , and you stay in a place .
and that &apos;s a great konzeptionelles model of the world , so you don &apos;t have a teilchenphysiker .
it would be a terrible model for a teilchenphysiker , because they don &apos;t play with bodenschwellen , but with these little strange particles .
and if you play with your particles , imagine all sorts of weird things -- like you &apos;re going right through walls , or you can be at the same time in two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the big everyday objects around us .
this hasn &apos;t really like my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s because i don &apos;t often play with particles .
well , i &apos;ll sometimes play with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody ever saw the particles .
but my logical side didn &apos;t enjoy it .
because if all these particles are made of particles and all these particles are the rules of quantum mechanics , then not simply all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that should not be that way .
so i &apos;d better feel better with the whole thing , if we could kind of show that alltagsgegenstände is also the rules of quantum mechanics .
so , a few years ago , i did it to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see , which was in the quantenmechanischen superposition .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot in the middle there .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
this is what i &apos;ll zoom up here . we &apos;re looking at the center here .
and here &apos;s a really great close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re going to look at is a little piece of metal , like a sprungbrett , and it &apos;s over the edge of the edge .
so i made this thing in a similar way to make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new siliziumscheiben , and rackerte for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to build this kind of a swimming pool , and getting this thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the quantenmechanischen superposition , but it needs a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m on the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then i &apos;m going to go up with other people , and i &apos;ll listen to all of these things , because i don &apos;t want them to do it , or , frankly , frankly , they &apos;re verschrecke .
so quantum mechanics says that unbewegliche objects will feel as well .
the mitfahrer for unbewegliche objects are not only humans , but the light that seems to be and the wind that it seems over the wind and the heat of the space .
and so , we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal verhält , we had to get out of the whole mitreisenden .
and we did that .
we turned the light off , put it off into a vacuum and saugten all the air , and kühlten it up to almost right now , in the elevator , in the elevator , was the piece of metal , trying to behave like it wanted .
so we measured its movement .
we found that it was really strange .
now , instead of quiet , it &apos;s going to be quiet , and the way that it was like this , the way it was like this -- like this -- like a ausdehnender and zusammen blasebalg .
and when we gave him a little push , we could vibrieren it at the same time and vibrieren it to vibrieren -- something which is just allowed in the quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you is what truly fantastic .
what does it mean for an object to vibrieren and vibrieren the same time ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillions of atoms from those atoms are still there , and at the same time , and the same time move the same atoms and down .
it &apos;s just überein to präzisen .
the rest of the time are delokalisiert .
and that means that every atom is at the same time in two different places , which means that the whole piece of metal is two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth me for all this year in the clean room , because , check that , the massstabsunterschied between a single atom and this piece of metal is about just the same as the piece of metal and with them .
so if a single atom can be at two different places , can be able to be able to be that piece of metal piece of the metal in two different places , why not you ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine you would be at the same time in multiple places , how would that feel ?
how would your consciousness deal with that that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we aufwärmten it , the light anschalteten and the box , we saw that the piece of metal was in a piece there .
and so , i had to have this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are really just quanten objects that are gefercht in a small room together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
now that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more behind it , it &apos;s still deeper .
it &apos;s like these connections , their connections , their connections with all these things around them , literally define who they are , and this is the tiefsinnige and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be thinking about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families are thinking about where they live and work , they want to pick them , between at least one hand of different cities , who are all standing in competition for new residents .
we &apos;re now far away from that goal .
there are billions of people in the developing world , which is not even a single city that they would welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more worth than building them .
so we could just get the world very easily with duzenden , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
this may sound sounds absurd for you , unless you &apos;ve never thought of new cities .
they &apos;re just going to share the construction of apartments against the cities .
imagine half of the people who want to live in homes , do this already ; the other half is not .
they could try to expand the capacity of existing homes .
but you know what they were going to be up with , in these apartments and their environment , leading to the laws to avoid , and avoid the way out of manufacturing .
so it turns out to be a very hard point of all this erweiterungen .
but you could go into a whole new place to build a completely new block of block , assuming the laws where the laws would be able to be able to support it , and not behindern .
so , i suggested that governments create new surfaces that have enough place for a city , and gave them a name : charter cities cities .
later , i found that , about the same time , javier and octavio about the challenge of the challenge of the challenge of the challenge .
you knew every year that every year , about 75.000 honduraner honduraner their land , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do the same thing that they can do .
so , in this point , javier said , &quot; what happens when we have a message of the american embassy , &quot; what happens when we want to do a message in the canadian rules , or the united states , can you work there , and you can be working on the surface of these messages , what you usually have to go to canada or america ? &quot;
in the summer in 2009 , honduras suffered a major heftigen .
for the next planmäßigen elections , pepe lobo won in a shift whose program promised both innovation as well as schlichtung .
he asked octavio to become his stabschef .
in the meantime , i was preparing myself in a talk to tedglobal .
it &apos;s in improvement , trying to try and look through the study of consumers , i &apos;ve been trying to reduce this complicated concept of charter city .
the first point is the importance of laws , which determine that you &apos;re not allowed to be able to mind existing wohnungsbesitzer .
we &apos;re paying attention to new technologies , but for progress , it requires technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that back to us .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
again , again , he showed him .
they were calling me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s give that the head of our country ! &quot;
and so we met in miami in december of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve been trying to make it clear , like valuable cities are much more valuable than they are .
and i used this chart graph to show how valuable rohland is in a place like new york , and think that there is a surface in some cases per square meter of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion at a place when there was a break , &quot; paul said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk made a very simple shape that a charter city city is a place , which is a gründungsvertrag of the laws of the laws of the laws that are available there , and people have to decide to decide to decide , either under those rules or not .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of the president , who meant that we have to do this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to bring our country forward .
i was asked to come to tegucigalpa , and i was going to take a talk back to the fourth talk again .
so i &apos;ve given another one with facts , which is a graph like this , which has tried to show that if you want to make a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and that sketch the new airport represents the new airport that was built in denver .
by itself , this airport alone has a hundred quadratkilometern .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the honduraner , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with at least 1,000 quadratkilometern .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand morning .
polite all have applaudiert .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and paying attention .
and the leader of congress came on the stage and said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the punch line that a new city offers new possibilities .
there would be the possibility of living in a city , instead , instead of hundreds of miles away from the north .
and a new city also includes new opportunities for leaders .
and the leaders of the government would be on the help of partnerländern , they could benefit from their partnerländern , they could benefit from the laws of the law for these charter charter , and that everybody would be able to trust that everybody can really get on the charter .
and the insight of president lobo was that the gewissheit of faith that i &apos;ve been thinking about as a way to get a foreign investors to come and make this city is gleichbedeutend for all of the parties for many parties for many years of fear and mistrust .
we were driven in an area .
this picture is from the place .
it fasst a thousand square miles .
and shortly after this , in january , they voted for a change in the constitution of the constitution to have a verfassungsgemäße policy , which is special entwicklungsgebiete .
in a country that has just been a intense crisis in which congress has been elected for these verfassungsänderung to a voice .
all the parties , all the fraktionen of society , supported this .
to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
on the 17th 17th , it was approved to a voice to a voice .
immediately after this choice , between the 21st and 24 24 , a delegation of about 30 parts of the world that was most interested in most of the world that was interested in the business in the business .
the place is a south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new urban city that built in south korea , built in south korea than the urban bostons .
everything you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get it .
the other place that was really interested in urbanism is singapore .
there are two cities built in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re looking at that , it &apos;s where we are today .
you &apos;ve already got a baugrundstück ; and you consider this area for the second city .
it &apos;s been working on a legal system that has been able to participate , and it &apos;s been working on a external system .
a country has already offered his supreme court to put his supreme appeal to the entgültige appeal of the system .
also , städtedesigner and -bauer are very interested .
they even bring money with one .
one thing , as you already know , has been understood , there &apos;s a lot of mieter .
there are many of these companies that would love to put in america , especially a place with a freihandelszone , and there are many people who would like to live there .
all over the world , there &apos;s 700 million people that they want to live in a different place .
one million people leave a year of leaving latin america , and go into the united states .
many of them are dads who are forced to do their families , to suchen- sometimes , it &apos;s single mothers who have to make enough money to eat and clothing .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s even kids who try to find their parents that they have , in some cases , in some cases , have no longer seen since a decade .
so what is it for an idea of building a whole new city ?
or even building duzende of these cities , or hundreds of all over the world ?
so what is it for an idea that every family has a choice between a number of cities that are in competition for new residents ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
so my friends , i asked me to say , thank ted .
do you know how many decisions you do in a typical day ?
you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
i recently made a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices , and the average number of choices , which is a typical american .
in addition , a study was done with ceos recently that they saw a week for a week .
and these scientists have documented the various themes with those who were doing this ceo , and how much time they were making decisions to make decisions that relate to the themes .
and they found that an average ceo was working in the week with 139 tasks .
each of these issues , of course , was many , of course , many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were in the nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions they took them an hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions .
you know how many decisions do you have to meet in the nine minutes for the nine minutes ?
how good do you think , are they making decisions to make decisions ?
today , i want to talk about one of the largest entscheidungsprobleme of our modern time , the entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise them , because i &apos;m blind , if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question today is today : are you ready to hear something about the entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem ?
thank you .
when i was a abschlussstudent at stanford university , i went to this very , very exklusiven store , at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store called the draeger .
this business , it was almost like a vergnügungspark .
they had 250 different types of mustard and essig and the other different kinds of different kinds of fruit and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we actually drink .
i loved it to this store , but at a time i asked myself , well , how is it that you never kaufst ?
here &apos;s the olive gear .
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including the ones that were embedded in boxes , which came from a thousand years of oil .
so one day i decided to go to a leader , and i asked the ladder , &quot; works this model that you really offer the people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up on the busladungen of tourists , which would come everyday and usually had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment and we chose marmelade for our experiment .
here &apos;s her marmeladen gang .
they had 348 different kinds of marmelade .
we &apos;ve made a little verkostungsecke directly at the entrance .
we have six different tastes in there , or do we put up there , and we &apos;ve looked at two different tastes , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , what would be more people stay and try and try and try and try it ?
there &apos;s more people when it was 24 , about 60 percent , as if it was six , 40 percent .
and after that , we looked at what people were more likely to buy a glass of marmelade .
now we saw the opposite effect .
the people who were standing when they were 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of glass .
the people who were standing when they were six , now , we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of marmelade .
now , if you calculate it , people bought six times a glass of marmelade who they had six choices , as if they had 24 .
now , not to buy a glass of marmelade , is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem is affecting us with very konsequenzreichen decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it &apos;s against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day , is saving resource .
so i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m doing with gur huberman , emir kamenica , where we spend the decisions for retirement for almost a million americans from about 650 plans in the entire united states .
and what we were looking at was whether the number of people who have been able to be able to have a rentensparplan plan that is going to be saved for tomorrow .
and we found that there was a correlation in fact .
so in those plans , we had about 657 plans that offered anything between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund were offered to be offered , in fact that , in fact , participation .
now , if you look at the extreme , the plans that offered the two fund , there was a teilnahmerate in the 1970s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that offered to fast almost 60 fund , the teilnahmerate now fell on about the sechzigsten .
now it turns out that even if you were to participate in part , if you were to be able to be able to be able to get more choices , you have negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , rather than that the more possibilities you were available , the more vermieden it and choose to choose it .
the more opportunities you were available , the more likely they put their money on their own money .
none of these extreme decisions , to the decisions that someone would recommend by people , when they &apos;re important for future well-being well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential consequences in humans that are providing more and more and more choices .
they make the decision -- schieben them , even when it comes against their own best interest .
they make more worse decisions -- worse cash and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re going to decide for things that they make themselves less zufrieden , even when they make objective better .
so the main reason for this is that we may be able to look at this huge sequence of mayonaise , mustard , essig and marmelade , but we &apos;re not in effect the comparison and move to the boundaries and then actually choose something from the fantastic offer .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different types of ways -- that they can just apply them in business .
first of all .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true as today as much more true .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; easy . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing regalfläche .
but in fact , if you look at the truth , and more that if you &apos;re willing to be ready , and more , you &apos;re going to get rid of it , well , then you have a rise of sales , it &apos;s going to drive up , and it &apos;s brought up , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an improvement in entscheidungswahrnehmung .
and as a proctor , the different head of head , the different head of 26 , and shoulders species , they &apos;ve got an increase of sales by 10 percent .
as the golden cat corporation , her 10 katzenstreus corporation , she saw that the profit by 87 percent -- a result of the two , the rise of sales and reducing cost .
you know , the average supermakrt today gives you 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart gives you 100,000 products .
but the neuntgrößte supermarket , which is now neuntgrößte supermarket in the world today , and they only provide 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in a dose .
now , in the world of sparens , i think one of the best examples that we have recently got to the market was something about how to have the choices that david laibson , which david has been very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
and every single harvard harvard harvard is now automatically teil .
those who are really offered a selection , they &apos;re not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to share it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing that i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the opportunities are different from each other .
and if their employees can &apos;t auseinanderhalten them , their customers can &apos;t . &quot;
now , before we started lunch , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be prepared for all the people in this audience to provide a all-inklusive holiday to the most beautiful road to the most beautiful street .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i &apos;d like to read them .
and now i &apos;ll give you a couple of seconds to read them , and then i want to clap you , if you &apos;re ready to embrace gary &apos;s .
okay . everybody who &apos;s ready to adopt gary &apos;s offer .
are that all ?
well let me show you something more of it .
you knew it was a trick , right ?
now , who is ready for this journey .
i think i may have heard more hands .
good .
the fact is that what it &apos;s like , in the first time , in the first time , when the second time , but i would want to guess that they felt more real time .
because the images made it feel real .
which brings me to the second technique that helps you to deal with the problem of the entscheidungsüberlastung , it is the konkretisierung .
it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between possibilities , understanding what consequences are associated with the individual opportunities , and they have to feel these consequences vivid and specific .
why do people spend average 15 to 30 percent more if you use a ec-karte or a card card , as you know , in cash ?
because we don &apos;t really feel money .
and it turns out that when you make it that something feels specific , it feels a very good tool to save people to save more .
so , in a study that i did with shlomo and alessandro previtero , we &apos;ve made a study with the people in ing -- employees who had all worked for ing -- and these people were all in a meeting where they signed their participation in their participation .
and during this meeting , we &apos;ve got these gathering exactly as it &apos;s been like she was , just as she was , we added a little bit more .
this thing that we have to add on , was that we &apos;ve been asked people to just think of all positive things that would happen in their lives if they save money .
when we did this simple thing , there was a participation increase of participation around 20 percent , and there was one increase of the number of people who were willing to save or four percent the amount they were willing to pay for the sparkonto .
third technology : kategorisierung .
we can do better with more categories than more choices .
so here &apos;s a study , for example , a study we did in a zeitschriftengang .
it turns out that in the wegmans supermärkten , up in the northeast , the number of the number between 331 different kinds of magazines has magazines to hoch .
but you know what ?
and if i show you about 600 magazines , or i &apos;m going to show you 400 categories , and you think these in 20 categories , you believe that i gave you more choices and a better auswahlerfahrung , when i gave them the 400 people , when i gave them 600 .
because the categories tell me how i can hold it apart .
here are two different schmuckauslagen .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; swing . &quot;
if you think that the left display is swing , and the ad on the right is the ad on the right , then you clap into your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
if you think that the guy on the left is jazz and that , on the right side , you clap please .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz and it &apos;s on the right is swing , but you know what ?
this is a highly unnützes kategorisierungsschema .
the categories have to say something that is not the choice .
and this is a problem that often you see , when you look at the long lists of these fund fund .
who do you want to inform it ?
my fourth technology : premise for complexity .
it turns out we can actually deal with more information than we think we have to simplify them .
we need to slow up the complexity .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the buy of a car .
here &apos;s a german autohersteller , which gives you the opportunity to konfigurieren your car completely .
and you have to make 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
now these are different decisions in the number of choices that they offer .
autofarben , außenfarbe of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , gear -- four possibilities .
so what i &apos;m doing now is , i change the order to make decisions .
half of the customers is going to go from the many possibilities , 56 autofarben to the low possibilities , four gear .
the other half of customers is all about low opportunities , four gear , to the 56 autofarben , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how are they interested .
if you &apos;re constantly using the standardauswahl for the decision , it means that you will be overwhelmed , the heisste , i &apos;m losing you .
what they &apos;re finding is that the people who go from the many to the low auswahlmöglichkteiten , they choose to vote .
we lose them .
go from the very few choices to the many , then stay in it .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is the order to change the order of this information .
when i start with the simple simple , i &apos;m learning how to auswähle .
even though , even though the gear choose to pick me nothing about my preferences in interior , it still bereitet me .
it puts me too excited about the big product that i zusammenstelle , and so i &apos;m ready to get ready to get interested in this .
let me summarize .
and i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that the problem of the problem -- easy -- you &apos;re going to be able to make it real alternatives -- make it real ; put it in -- we can do better with more categories , less opportunities , prepare for complexity .
each of these techniques that i &apos;ll describe today is to help them manage the opportunities -- good for them , they can use them for themselves , good for people who they offer service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you are in choice .
and the more we choose to choose , the better we &apos;re going to be able to practice the art of the decision .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allocca , trends-manager at youtube . i &apos;m looking at youtube-videos .
that &apos;s true .
now , we want to talk about how videos are going to be viral , and then why that &apos;s important .
we all want to be -- running , berühmtheiten , singers singers -- when i was young , seemed like this infinitely difficult .
but webvideos enables that we are all of our creative activities of wahnsinnig , in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be heard about the internet next saturday .
but there are more than 48 hours of video per minute .
and again , again , a tiny percentage of male , and will look at thousands of times and look at thousands of times for the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : tastemaker , teilnahmecommunities and the unexpected .
well , then we want .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
woah !
ohhhhh , wowwww !
last year sendete bear vasquez , that he was filmed in front of his house in the national park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this graph shows how it looked like when the video was popular for the first time .
i didn &apos;t really want to make a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing , you know , that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to have to yosemite .
he had uploaded a lot of naturvideos .
and this video was actually being sent in january .
what &apos;s going on here ?
there was jimmy kimmel .
jimmy kimmel sendete the tweet that made the video so popular .
because tastemaker how jimmy jimmy kimmel us new and interesting things , and show a big audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday , friday &apos;s forward to the weekend , weekend &apos; to the weekend , weekend . friday , ihr , you didn &apos;t think that we would take this conversation conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
rebecca blacks &apos;s one of the most popular videos videos of the year .
so this year , almost 200 million times .
this is what the chart looked like .
just like &quot; double rainbow , &quot; it seems to be out of nothing .
what &apos;s going on that day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also freitage .
but what about this day , that particular friday ?
now , tosh.0 gabelte , it started writing on a lot of blogs .
michael j. nelson from the mystery science theater was a first one who made a joke about it .
what matters is that a single individual or a group of tastemakers took up a point of view with a big audience and beschleunigte the process .
then this community formed of people who shared this big insiderwitz , and we started talking about it and playing around .
now there &apos;s 10,000 parodien of &quot; friday &quot; at youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a mathematician for every single day .
unlike the einseitigen conversation in the 20th century , the community of the community is to become our way of being part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or something new .
&quot; nyan cat &quot; is animation and music in endlosschleife .
this is it , very simple .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you hold it for crazy , you ought to know that there is a dreistundenversion that has been looking at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats to look at this video .
what matters is , the creativity that is in the internetkultur of the techies and geeks .
there was back .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole remix-gemeinde made out of the ground that made it from a stupid joke to something that we can all participate in .
today , we don &apos;t just find pleasure in something we do with .
who could voraussehen the everything ?
who would have predicted &quot; double rainbow &quot; or &quot; rebecca black or &quot; nyan cat . &quot;
what would have done to be your writing where you can do that ?
in a world in which every minute , in which every minute , in a minute , will only be a unique and unexpected and unexpected hervorstechen , like the videos .
i &apos;ll admit i was not very interested in my friend , when a friend of mine said , i should be able to look at this great video , about a guy in new york , in new york .
i got a ticket , because i &apos;m not on the radweg , but often , there &apos;s a disability that don &apos;t leave you on the radweg .
because it was completely surprising and humorous , casey niestats idee idea and his argument , five million times .
this approach is true for everything that we &apos;re creative .
and all of that leads to a big question ...
what does that mean ?
ohhhh .
what does that mean ?
tastemaker , creative teilnehmergemeinden , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to have access to the audience .
as i said , one of the biggest stars stars -- justin bieber -- did his beginning to youtube .
no one needs to your ideas green light .
and today , we feel all of us as owners of culture .
and these are not the characteristics of old media , and they &apos;re barely able to make the media of today &apos;s media , but they &apos;re going to determine the future .
thank you .
now , how do i talk about a four minutes of the connectedness of a four year-old girl , and how i can talk about three generations in a little bit of the chinese meer , and the amazing power of a little bit of the chinese sea , and a connection in a little bit of the chinese sea , in the life , that little girl and never disappeared -- this little girl that lives now in san francisco and talks about today ?
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that is put together .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzlestückchen .
imagine the first piece : a man who &apos;s burning his lebenswerk .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life was held held held together by oneness and freedom of his home .
if you think of it in the einmarsch of the kommunisten in saigon , as he must say that his life was a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , spotteten now .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
i had to worry that it was not for nothing , and it was my job to learn that the story was really trying to zerdrücken us , but we &apos;ve gone .
the next puzzleteil is , like a boat in the early days of ausläuft .
my mother may was 18 when her father died -- already in an arrangierten marriage marriage , with two little girls .
for her , she had the life for her : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that it could fail .
after a four four and filmreifen saga , a boat on the lake , as an fischerboot .
the adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear of pirates , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother was wearing a little giftflasche .
and in a gefangennahme , my sister would have only been my sister and i , and then i was drinking .
my first memories are from the boat -- the steady tuckern of the engine , the clapping of a every wave on the front of the bug , the vast and blank horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that many times came , but from the todesmut of the men on our boat , or on the ausfall of the engine , who didn &apos;t want to start six hours .
but i remember the lights in front of the coast of ice , and the young man who died and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and on the taste of the first apfels that gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple ever tasted this way again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next puzzlestück is about four women in three generations to build a new life together .
we made ourselves down in footscray , one of the middle of bewohnten , whose population is made of immigrantenschichten .
unlike the alteingesessenen mittelklassevororten , whose existence was completely unknown to me , there was no anspruchsdenken in footscray .
the smells of the ladentüren came from the rest of the world .
and the fetzen broken englischs were zwischen between people who had one thing in common : they started neu .
my mother worked on farms , then on an assembly line in a autofabrik , six days , double layers .
and they somehow managed to find the time , and they have to have english .
we were poor .
every dollar has been given and got to another education , and it was put in the math , no matter where we had to get rid of it , most of the new things came from second hand .
two pair of strümpfe for school , each to cover the holes in the other .
one schuluniform to the knöcheln , because she had to pass six years .
and there was the rare chöre of &quot; schlitzauge &quot; and here , and there &apos;s wandmalereien , &quot; asian , go home . &quot;
after where ?
something versteifte in me .
there was a treffen meeting , and a calm voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until her alpträume came , so i could get her aufwecken .
she eröffnete a computergeschäft , then made a kosmetikerausbildung and opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t change the change , angry and unflexibel , and sorgenerfüllte children , trapped between two worlds .
loans and sponsoren were searching .
centers were built .
i lived in parallelwelten .
in one , i was the classic asian student , the unerbittliche demands in itself .
in the other hand , i was involved in uncertain life , the tragic scars of violence , the drogenmissbrauchs and isolierung .
but so many got over the years .
and because of this aid , i became auserwählt in my last year in my last year .
and i was wurde from a puzzlestück to the next katapultiert , and the edges didn &apos;t fit the edges .
tan le , anonyme bewohnerin of footscray , was now tan , refugee , and social activist who was invited to lectures in places that they had never heard , and in homes , whose existence would never have imagined .
i was not familiar with the etikette .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the besteck .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to a routine and the comfort of an unknown vororts back -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who had every one of her days as abschlossen for 20 years , by telling each other the stories of their day and einschliefen , we &apos;re still in bed .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was as old as she was when we climb the boat .
no one has been an opportunity .
&quot; do it simple , &quot; she said , &quot; and isn &apos;t that what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i spoke about jugendarbeitslosigkeit and education , and training , and entrechteten vernachlässigung and entrechteten .
and the more open i spoke , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the lebenslagen , so many of you did what they loved , living in the limits of the possible .
and even though i graduated in my degree , i realized that i was not going to be a career in law law .
there had to be another puzzlestück .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s going to be a außenseiter , a neuankömmling , a neuankömmling -- and not just okay , but what you have to be grateful for , maybe a gift to be grateful .
because dazuzugehören can lead so easily to collapse in the horizons , can be so easy to mean the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;m now enough to know from my bequemlichkeitsbereich to know that , yes , the world auseinanderbricht , but not how to befürchtet it .
opportunities that would not have been allowed , became explicitly encouraging .
there was a energy , optimism optimism optimism , a strange mixtur of humility and the wagnisses .
so i followed my gut gut .
i collected a small team of people around me , for the schublade , &quot; isn &apos;t &quot; a unwiderstehliche challenge .
we didn &apos;t have a cents for a year .
at the end of each other , i cook , i &apos;ve been cooking soup soup that we shared .
we worked late in the night .
most of our ideas were nuts crazy , but it was a couple of brilliant , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to make the u.s.
after just a journey there .
my gut gut again .
three months later , i was moved to the adventure .
before i abschließe the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time , in the konfuzianismus , the social norm and the local mandarin was the most important person .
life hasn &apos;t changed since centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mom moved her alone .
with 17 she was wurde the second woman &apos;s second woman , whose mother suggested .
without support her husband , she worried him for a sensation by bringing it to trial and she was in her own case , and a greater more sensation than she won .
&quot; not &quot; turned into unwahr .
i just duschte in a hotel room in sydney , when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the duschtrennwand , and looked at the other side .
i knew it was coming to say goodbye .
my mom called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in footscray and sat around her sarg .
we told her stories , and versicherten her , we were still in her .
and at midnight , the monk came , and he said he had to close the sarg .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she &apos;ve been this morning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t left it . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , then it &apos;s through the women .
see who we were , and how life has formed us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives to come into the quere .
the defeat was too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i think of the boat .
who would ever want one ?
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , vor , before berechtigungsanspruch .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous every wave of the wave , the unbeirrte of the engine , the big horizon , that doesn &apos;t guarantee ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and it could be safe , i would do it .
it &apos;s also a mother &apos;s mother today in the fourth or five .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it that photography ?
because this is , of course , a picture you can &apos;t pick up with your camera .
and yet my interest in photography when i received my first digital camera , at age 15 years old .
i put it together with my former vorliebe of drawing , but it was a little bit different because when the camera was using the camera , the camera was in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends off when you push on the trigger .
so for me , it seemed to be a lot of photography in photography , to be at the right place at the right time .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something where the process starts to keep the cause .
pictures like this : a construction site along a much befahrenen street .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and yet , a realistic level .
or photos like this -- dark and farbenfroh at the same time , but all with the common goal to make a realistic level .
when i say reality , i mean .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can actually capture , but i always want to make it look like you can have , in a photograph .
photos where you have to think a moment of a moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s about to capture an idea than a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes it &apos;s an illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be done on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what realistic is realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the essentials are very simple .
i see you as a puzzle puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfectly vorstellbare physical objects that we &apos;re all identify in a three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way , combined with each other , you can create something that looks more sophisticated than if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
so we cheat our brains , because our brains don &apos;t really make sense that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combine by pictures .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our lives .
but if we combine photos , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they &apos;re just going wrong .
so i would say that there &apos;s three simple rules to follow a realistisches outcome .
as you can see , that &apos;s not three special images .
but you can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that using the photos of the same way .
secondly , the pictures should have the same beleuchtungsart .
and these two pictures fulfill these two demands -- the same altitude and the same beleuchtungsart .
and three , it &apos;s impossible to make it impossible to tell you where the individual images start and end by making it nahtlos .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photo was put together .
so by the way paint , contrast , contrast on the edge of the individual images , like feldtiefe , entsättigte colors and disorders , we verwischen the boundaries between the various images , and they look like a single picture , although a picture can actually contain hundreds of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you may think that this is just a landscape , and it &apos;s been manipulated .
but this picture is completely completely set into photographs of different places .
i personally think that it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to make compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been taken on a anglerausflug .
the shore is from another place .
the unterwasser-teil is from a quarry .
and yeah , i even have the house on the island on the island of red .
so , in order to get a realistisches outcome , so i &apos;m looking out of planning .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of various images .
and here &apos;s a very good job .
and if you make good shots , the result can be pretty much beautiful , and it can be pretty realistic .
so it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that can us think is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you why many electronic gesundheits-projekte failed .
and i think the most important thing is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve introduced was to take a haupt-zuhörer .
and you don &apos;t scientifically scientifically scientifically -- she &apos;s putting a cup of coffee or tea , and the patients , families , relatives , &quot; what is it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everybody -- most of the electronic gesundheits-projekte failed : because we stopped listening .
this is my wlan-waage . a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got a button .
and every morning i stick .
and yes , i have a job , as you might recognize .
i &apos;ve got my job at 95 pounds .
it &apos;s very simple : every time i stick to the scale , i also send my data to google health .
and they &apos;re also going to be there from my allgemeinarzt , so he can see where my gewichtsproblem is , and it &apos;s not only in the moment that i need to support or do that , but with a look at the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe it &apos;s known to you know , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 follower on twitter .
so every morning i stick on my wlan-waage , and people talk to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; to lunch , &quot; i &apos;m rather than just a little salat today . &quot;
but this is the netteste thing that can happen because this is the gruppenzwang , gruppenzwang , to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could use patients that smoking .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to play in some kind of game in order to control their health .
the next week comes out of the market .
there &apos;s going to be a little bit of blutdruck-messgerät , which you &apos;re going to do on an iphone or something like this .
and it &apos;s going to allow people to measure their blood pressure , for example , and to share it with others , for something more than 100 dollars .
in this point , the patients come to the patient . you can &apos;t only do the control of the game , you know , but you can also help us with the challenge of the challenges that are in front of us , and the kostenexplosion of health care , double demand , and so on .
make these kinds of things that are easy to use , and start to hug them with the patients in the team .
and you can get it through these ways , but by crowdsourcing .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done is , i want to share with you a quick video .
we all have navigationssysteme in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly exactly where all the machines are around maastricht .
we know even one where all the gas stations are .
and yeah , we can find fastfood-ketten .
but where would the next aed to help this patient ?
we have herumgefragt , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next life-saving aed was to find in that moment .
so , what did we do ? we did crowdsourcing in the netherlands .
we set up a website and a menschenmasse , &quot; when you see a aed , please , please tell us where he is , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during geschäftszeiten , of course .
and over 10,000 aeds have been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find that apps .
and we have designed a ipad-app .
we &apos;ve developed an app for layar , extended reality to find these aeds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like maastricht , and somebody goes down , you can use your iphone , and within the next couple of weeks , you also get your microsoft-handy to find the next aed that can save life .
and we don &apos;t just want to do this today , like the product of the product , which is called the product , but as a aed4us .
and we want to bring this into a global scale .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us , to help us , like knotenpunkte , to crowdsource these aeds around the world .
and if you &apos;re on vacation , and somebody goes down , it &apos;s your own verwandtschaft or anyone else , you can find a aed .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies all over the world will help us at bestätigung for bestätigung .
these could be kurierdienste , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the gemeldete aed is still in its place .
please help us and try to do the health , not just to improve it , but to the hand .
thank you .
today , i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in solartechnologie-branche .
and my little startup wants to make us protect ourselves by ...
and it &apos;s crowdsourcing .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may be until it &apos;s geladen .
now -- we can just skip it -- i &apos;m just going to just take the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
solartechnologie is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i &apos;ve launched a program to take the stars in technology and design , to be able to take away a year and work in an environment that &apos;s pretty much everything you actually hate , we &apos;ve got them working in government .
the program is called &quot; code for america &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like friedenscorps for geeks .
we choose some fellows every year , and we let them work with stadtverwaltungen .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them into rathäuser .
and they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what they really do is to show what &apos;s possible with technology today .
so you meet al .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
this is what he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really is looking for is somebody who &apos;s freischaufelt him when he knows , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at brandbekämpfung when he &apos;s going from a meter snow .
how did he get to look for this particular kind of help ?
we had a team of fellows in boston last year , which is the code for america .
they were in february , and it has a lot of geschneit .
and they found that the city never nie the city hydranten .
but one particular fellow , a man named erik michaels-ober , noticed another thing , and that was that the residents are frei the sidewalks of frei , right in front of these parts .
so he did what every good developers would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app that you can adopt a fire fire .
you stimmst to schaufeln him , if it schneit .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you &apos;re not doing that , somebody can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game game .
this is a very modest app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that have written fellows for the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other regierungstechnologie .
it spreads rapidly .
there &apos;s this guy in the city department of the city of the city of the city , which has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but to adopt the citizens .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami-sirenen work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then , i decided to use the app to clean the citizens to clean up the verstopften .
and chicago has just introduced them to have the people who are buergersteige when it schneit .
we know now nine cities that are planning to use these app .
and it is verbreitet organic , of course , of course .
if you know something about regierungstechnologie , you know that it doesn &apos;t normally .
it takes some software in the rule for a few years .
we had a team who was working on a project last year in boston , for three people for a half months .
it was a way to figure out which parents can find out what the right public schools for their children .
we became told later that if it was going to take over the normal channels , it would have taken over two years , and it would have cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
there &apos;s a project right now in the california law that has cost two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading out , is a kind of a shot from the bug to the institution of government .
it shows how the government could work better -- no more like a private company , how many people think she should .
and not even like a technik-unternehmen , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more important to this app is that it represents a new generation , which represents the problem of government -- not as the problem of an verknöcherten institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good in collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a great community of people who make the tools that we need to engage things effectively .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country that stand up and write regierungs-apps , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain , they fix them .
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all forget of your feelings about politics and all the other things that we really upset about is government , the government , in the core , in the core words , in the words of tim o reilly , &quot; what we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people has given up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i &apos;m going to say you that you know , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government eventually takes their power -- erinner you , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , will affect how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know much about the government when i started this program .
and as a lot of people , i thought that in the government , in the government , i thought it &apos;s about to choose to choose people in office .
now , after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s especially in communities to get beutelratten .
this is the call center for service and information .
this is where you are usually out of , if you &apos;re in your town .
when you ever have the chance to work in your städtisches call , like our fellow scott silverman , as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re all the -- you &apos;ll see that people who call government because of many different kinds of problems , including a beutelratte in your house .
so scott gets this anfruf .
he type &quot; beutelratte &quot; into the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the tierfänger .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is abhaut ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the beutelratten .
boston is not just a call center .
it has an app , a web- and handy-app , called &quot; citizens connect . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work very wise people in the office of the new urban office in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- it came in : &quot; beutelratte in my mülltonne , can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what &apos;s happening with &quot; citizens &quot; is different .
scott was unterhielt to human beings .
but on &quot; citizens connect , &quot; so anybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post that we get was , &quot; i went over there , and found the mülltonne behind the house .
beutelratte ? yes . alive ? yap .
turned the mülltonne on the side . went home .
good night , cute beutelratte . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s where digital is true .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is to crowdsource .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technological definition of the platform .
i &apos;m talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
one citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
they connected these two people .
and you would have them to connect them with government services , if they were needed that , but a neighbor is a far better and billigere alternative to government services .
if a neighbor helps the other , we empower our communities .
let &apos;s call the tierfänger , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think that government is not the same thing as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is .
how often we have chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy -- and sometimes we &apos;ve got a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we &apos;re expecting to go back , and we expect the government , our values , and we &apos;ve got our needs , and then hasn &apos;t changed a lot ?
that &apos;s because the government is like a further ocean , and politics is the supreme 15cm .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that this thing that we own , and that we pay for , something that works against us , something else , and then we entmachten ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to be working for us , we have to do bureaucracy sexy sexy .
because this is where the actual regierungsarbeit is happening .
we need to be up to the machinery of the government .
so the occupythesec-bewegung did it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that wrote a very detailed 325-seitigen report , which is an answer to the sec-memo on the gesetzesvorlage of gesetzesvorlage .
this is not politically active , this is being active .
now , for those of us who have given up the government is time that we &apos;re thinking about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we have to achieve what we need to do without improving the institution that we need to do ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of the government is fundamentally umzudeuten in a way that can actually achieve something by society .
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up the internet , and that knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to just build the systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up with to see her voice as granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this battle that we all fight , which is who speak ; they &apos;re all allowed to talk .
they can make their mind , on every channel on every channel , and they do it .
so if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t worry so much to use your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the work of government .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
this may be , a fire fire , unkraut unkraut to jäten , unkraut a trash with a beutelratte trash .
and sure , we would have this fire fire hydranten all the time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we are not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers from government to pay taxes and receive their performance .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we improve citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all here for you : if it &apos;s about the big important things that we need to do , we &apos;re all going to be able to be a lot of voices , or are we also going to be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
now , i think i &apos;m going to tell people how wonderful the new technologies is , i &apos;m going to tell you what i really think . and i &apos;m going to try to understand what i really think about , with these incredible sprüngen sprüngen , which is so quickly that we can barely keep up .
and i &apos;m going to start to show you a single , boring slide .
... i could just show you the slide .
this is a slide that i randomly selected from my folder .
i &apos;m not talking about the details of the slide , but rather than the universal shape .
this slide shows data from an analysis of an analysis about the power of risc processors , compared to the power of a local area .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , as many of the others that we find often in our field , is a kind of just on a semi-logarithmischen curve .
in other words , every step here is a power in the leistungsskala .
and this is a novelty that we have to use this type of scale on semi-logarithmischen curves in technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
so if you could turn the lights back up .
again , again , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in the technology of semi-logarithmischen curves ?
the reason for that is , if i draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the years , so the timeline of a species , and this is an random amount of technology that i want to show with a graph , then the graph is silly .
and they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now if i want to record a different technology , we &apos;ll say a transporttechnologie , and then it would be a scale on the semi-logarithmischen scale , that would come in a flat line .
but if something like this , this is what happens , it changes the circumstances .
so as fast as fast as fast as fast as the mikroprozessor-technologie progression , we could go into a taxi and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not that fast .
and that had never been in the history of technologie-entwicklung , which is this kind of rekursivem growth , which is the order of the order of the order of the scale .
so the question i want to ask you now is , if you look at this exponential cross , you see , they don &apos;t go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything forever forever and forever evolved as quickly as now .
there are two options .
it &apos;s either going to be a classic s-kurve like here , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
it &apos;s about it .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
it &apos;s really like this , that we &apos;re right now in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world in a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and do i have a lot of myself , is how this new world will be ?
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing to be very confusing in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in the year 2000 and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we &apos;ve got a conference where people talk about the future , and you find that the future is still in 2000 .
further than that , we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future is geschrumpft every year in a year , since i &apos;m on this world .
and i think the reason is that we realize that something is happening .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we know that there are simply no sense of power to be 30 or 50 years to look into the future , because everything is going to be so different from what we don &apos;t make sense of what we do now do .
now , i want to talk about what this might be , this transition in which we are right now .
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk to you about some other things that are really nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i believe in order to understand this , we have to take a step back and look at a longer zeitskala .
so i want to look at this on the zeitskala of life &apos;s life .
i think that makes sense , if you split it into some milliarden-schritte .
so , let &apos;s go back , for 2.5 billion years , the earth was a great , steriler steinklumpen with many of them schwebenden chemicals .
now , if you look at the way that the chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture about how they anstellten .
i also think there are theories that start to understand how everything is starting with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a vereinfachte story of what is that at that time little öltröpfchen herumschwebten , which are different kinds of rezepten for chemicals .
some of these öltröpfchen had a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and to grow .
all of those things were .
these little öltröpfchen were in the sense of primitivste .
but , however , they weren &apos;t alive in today &apos;s sense , because every single one of them was just a small , zufälliges recipe of chemicals .
and every time it shared it , they have verteilt chemicals into these ungleichen amounts of chemicals .
so every tröpfchen is a little bit different .
in fact , the tröpfchen , which was one of the one for growth in growth , faster than others and more chemicals from the outside and more chemicals , and faster .
so , these tend to survive longer , and it &apos;s the way to survive in grösserem degrees .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , when these tröpfchen were learning a trick on abstraction .
in any way that we don &apos;t quite understand , this is the ability to have the ability to have the ability to niederzuschreiben information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and in a certain chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they &apos;ve found a way in this geistlosen , evolutionary way of a way that allowed them to see what they were made of , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing is that this kind of information is to store the time of 2.5 billion years , where they were born , right ?
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from the exactly the same code and the same notation .
and that is exactly the exact same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re in fact that we can just be able to write something in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 mikrogramm of a white pulvers , which i &apos;m trying to keep in the airports away .
in this is -- what i did is , i took this code -- the code of normal letters that we use to use -- and i &apos;ve written my visitenkarte on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve been verstärkt by 10 ^ 22 times .
so if somebody wants to have a hundred million copies of mine , i have enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was actually a egoist , i &apos;d have been writing it on a virus , and i &apos;ve written it in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna set of dna was an interesting step .
and the veranlagten of these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened is very interesting , very interesting , where things were completely different , and because these cells began to communicate and exchange information , so communities evolved by cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
so , for example , for example , is growing the consistency of antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how to get away from penicillin and put this information with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria , which are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate with each other .
this communication was allowed the reasons of communities , which was in some sense in the same boat ; they were synergetisch .
so they either survived , or they were going to go together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repeated and more often by evolution .
the übergangsstelle is now where these communities are so close to these communities that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into the dna system .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at this point , we have mehrzellige communities , communities of many verschiedlichen zellentypen , which together , as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also one of those mehrzellige community .
we have a lot of cells , which is not on themselves .
your skin cells are useless without any heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started changing , so that the plane , on which evolution was happening , no longer the individual cell , but the whole zellengemeinschaft that we call organism .
now the next step happened within these communities .
the zellengemeinschaften began to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures that made nothing else to process as information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the informationsverarbeitungsapparat that built up these zellengemeinschaften .
they started educating specialists in the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and that &apos;s on information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave you evolutionary advantage .
because at this point an individual -- learning happened in the time of a single organism , instead of this evolutionary period .
so one organism could learn , for example , for example , could learn a certain fear of fear because she liked it and made him sick , the last time he ate it .
now , this could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas before it took hundreds of thousands of years ago , because that this information had to be learned by the individuals that died because of these fear of fear , because these informationsverarbeitungsstrukturen were not there yet .
so the nervous system has been using the evolutionsprozess of this particular model , because evolution , because evolution was now within an individual .
she could take place within a time period .
what happened after that , is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
so , for example , as an example of the raffinierteste , the human language is the human language .
it &apos;s a really amazing invention when you think about it .
i &apos;ve got a very complicated , very complicated , unordentliche and verwirrte idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;ll basically give grunzende sounds from me , in hope to create a similar verwirrte idea in your head , which has a sort of resemblance to my original idea .
so we take some very complicated , very complicated , turn it into sound , a sequence , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so that &apos;s what allows us to do again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we &apos;ve got humanity , we &apos;ve got to abstract .
we go through the same steps , which have gone through -- the abstraction of our methods , as we think , how we have data .
for example , the invention of language was a small step in this direction .
telefonie , computers , videobänder , cd-roms and so on are all of our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to be able to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and it &apos;s able to grow faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today , evolution is going to happen at the time of microseconds .
so you &apos;ve seen tys little evolutionsbeispiel , where he &apos;s seen a little bit of evolution in the convolution program program , right outside your eyes .
so we &apos;ve got the zeitskalen again .
the first steps of history that i told you is a billion years a piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
then the nächstens steps , like language and so on , dauerten less than one million years .
and these next steps , as electronics , seem to take a few decades .
the process is feeding itself , and it &apos;s going to be , i think , auto-katalytisch is the word for it -- when something seine .
the more it changes , the faster changes it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see in this explosionsartigen curve curve .
we see the process that feed itself .
i live from building computers , and i know that i &apos;m the mechanism that i &apos;m using to build computers , not to use , without having been done some recently , gemachten progress in computing .
my recent activity is to start designing objects such a complexity complexity , that it &apos;s impossible to design in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is in verbindungsmaschine power .
it has billions of them .
what i do is doing instead , and the designers of thinking , is we think of a particular machine , which is this machine , and the machine makes it something that &apos;s far beyond our skills , better and faster than we could ever do it .
and it &apos;s in part of the ways that we don &apos;t even understand .
so , a method which is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve used recently , is evolution itself .
this is what we put in a evolutionsprozess machine in the machine which is going on in the mikrosekunden-bereich machine .
to call an example of an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that evolved from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , generiere , a hundred million randomly randomly ausgewählte hundreds of instructions .
now , please run all these randomly selected instructions , all of the programs , and pick out the ones that my targets are the next . &quot;
so in other words , i first define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to come up numbers , like a simple example , which i &apos;ve already used for this .
so , find programs that can sort of the most likely numbers .
of course , there &apos;s a chance at random the instructions to be very small instructions that you just have a number of numbers , so probably none of the instructions are going to do this .
but one of them may have a little bit of happiness in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , don &apos;t take those 10 percent of the sequences that i have the next .
store that down , lösche the rest .
now , reproduziere all the übriggebliebenen that have the numbers of the numbers .
and with a method of rekombinierens , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through their subroutinen , and the kids , and the kids are vererben the properties of subroutinen the properties of these two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that evolved by combinations of programs that have come closer to the goals than others .
say , &quot; let &apos;s repeat this process . &quot;
again , again .
maybe take some mutations .
and try the whole thing again with another generation .
all of these generations take a few milliseconds .
and so i can go through a evolution of millions of years in the computer in a few minutes , or more complicated times .
finally , i get programs to get the numbers perfect numbers .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have ever written by hand .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s selfish and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure that they do the job because they get out of a series of hunderttausenden programs who have done the job .
because their life was hanging on whether they did the job right .
and i sat in a 747 with marvin marvin with marvin minsky , he minsky a map , and he says , &quot; oh look at it .
there is , &quot; this airplane is made out of hunderttausenden kleinteilen , which together in order to make your flight secure . don &apos;t power you ? &quot;
we know that a entwicklungsprozess is not optimal when it &apos;s too complicated .
so we start to leave on computers , for a process , which is very different from classical engineering engineering .
he allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t even understand the possibilities of it .
so gewissermassen überflügelt us the technology .
we use these programs to make the computer much faster , so that we can make these processes even faster .
so there &apos;s a rückkopplung .
it &apos;s going to be faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies are feeding themselves from themselves .
we go up .
we &apos;re at one point , which is , according to , which is when einzeller-organismen evolved to mehrzeller-organismen .
so we &apos;re the amöben , and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell we &apos;re doing here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this übergangpunkt .
but i really believe that after we have something .
i think it &apos;s very hochmütig from us to say that we are the product of evolution .
and i think all of us here are part of the creation of what comes next .
well , the lunch is before , and i think i &apos;ll hear it now before i &apos;m going to get rausgewählt .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert with sufi-sänger mukhtiar ali .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the time of the ancient indian epos .
if we wanted to travel the indians at the time , we went into a car and schwirrten over the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
at the time , when the great indian kriegerprinz , he took , he took a bow , shot into the soil and the water .
now we &apos;re doing that with bohrern and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
it really made me sad .
i got a fear of technology .
i &apos;m afraid that i could be able to lose the sonnenuntergang of sonnenuntergang , without a camera , and without tweet to my friends .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silberne taschenuhr .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the magischste thing for me .
it became a goldener access to a world full of pirates and verunglückter ships and images in my imagination .
it came to me as when we were holding our fancy clocks and cameras to dream of it .
they kept us being inspired .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use magic , rather than killing magic .
at 16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling , which can connect readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
they bring pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
it used to be more sense .
but what do we do with it ?
i just go to khoya , an interactive ipad .
here says , &quot; put your fingers on any light . &quot;
and so -- here is , &quot; this box is , &quot; i write my name . &quot;
and i get a character in the book .
and again , a letter for me -- and the ipad knows through gps , which is where i live -- that &apos;s really about me .
and the child , in me , is really really excited about this .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean a magician and dragon , but the magic of childhood , those ideas we all had as children .
just a glass glass , i always found a very exciting .
so , you have to blow the ipad , and the fireflies rauslassen .
and it turns out through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put a galaxy in a single murmel .
and that &apos;s why every book here is going to be a little bit of the world , and every book that i get here to the magical device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
fantasybücher had always been maps , but these maps were static .
this map is growing , and it stands , and it &apos;s shining and it is it in the rest of the book .
it also turns out to other places of the book .
i go in here .
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that indisch is also very zeitgemäß .
these are the apsaras .
we &apos;ve all heard of feen and nymphen , but how many people outside india know their colleagues , the apsaras ?
the poor apsaras were caught for thousands of years in indras chambers in an old book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary history of children .
a story that auseinandersetzt with new issues like the umweltkrise .
for the issue , a big problem of the last 10 years is that children in their rooms are sitting in their rooms , to their computers , on their computers .
but now , using mobile technology , we can take our kids to the natural world with their technology .
in a sense of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search for a search , you have to go out and collect the camera &apos;s camera .
as a child , i had the collections of stöckern , rocks , kieseln and muscheln .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do anymore .
this is zurückgebracht . you have to go out to make a picture of a flower a flower .
in another chapter , you have to ein a piece of baumrinde and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can go online .
a child in london shows the picture of a fuchses and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities to connect the world and technology to each other .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning to do a interaction where you used the video of the ipads and through augmented reality , an animation of elfen , looking at a plant in front of the house .
in a place , the screen picks up with leaves .
you have to do the sound of the winds , and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the natural forces of technology is getting closer in the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and we get closer to the natural world , and the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really a extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in untersuchungshaft , prisons or todeszellen .
i spend most of my time with the socially weakest in the sozialbausiedlungen and in places where there &apos;s a lot of hopelessness .
to be here at ted , to see and hear how stimulierend that is , has given me a lot of force .
in the short time , there was a clear thing to me : ted has an identity .
you can say things that have influence the world .
and sometimes , if something comes about ted , it gets meaning and force that it wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i think we have learned that the words of a teacher matters , but the words of a dedicated teacher are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good things as a doctor &apos;s doctor , but you can still do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i &apos;ve not learned this in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i was big in a family , a traditional afroamerikanischen household , which was dominated by a matriarchin , and this matriarchin was my grandmother .
she was a taffe , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every familienstreit .
it was also the beginning of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a sklavenfamilie .
their parents were born in the 1840ern in virginia as a slave .
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery formed their view very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also liebevoll .
when i met her as a young boy , she came up with me and umarmte me .
they got me so clear that i could barely breathe . then she left me .
one or two hours later , when i came across her , she came up to me and said , &quot; bryan , you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said no , &quot; no , &quot; she said me . when i said yes , &quot; yes , &quot; she left me .
it was something that made that you wanted to be in your direction .
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention .
my cousins went everywhere .
i remember , i have to be eight or nine , that i woke up one morning and went into the living room . all my cousins walked around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the zimmers and staring at me .
first , i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and smiles , but she looked very serious .
this was about 15 or 20 minutes , and she came up and came over to me , and she said , and she said , &quot; come , come , bryan . you and i , we need to talk . &quot;
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
i never forget it .
she took me out and said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t weitersagst . &quot;
i said , &quot; i promised . &quot;
she said , &quot; ehrenwort ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down , and she looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i will never forget that .
and she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me three things , bryan . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; as the first of all , i want you to love your mom forever . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise to promise you &apos;re always going to take care of you . &quot;
i &apos;m my mother , so i said , &quot; yeah , grandma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
then she said , &quot; next to me , you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , and i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise me is , &quot; you will never drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old and so i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the land , in the old , rural south and i have a brother who is a year older and younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother came home and brought this sixpack beer beer with my sister , and i went to the forest .
we just alberten around there as otherwise .
then he took a schluck of beer , and he offered my sister , and she took me , and then she offered me .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . it &apos;s all right now . does it . i don &apos;t want to do a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do this , you &apos;re going to do everything that we do .
i had what , your sister had what . go , a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want you . you just do it . &quot;
my brother looked at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? now , what . &quot;
and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t still make you still crazy because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells everybody grandchildren that they are special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to say something .
i shouldn &apos;t do that .
this is probably going to transmit public .
i &apos;m a 52 years old , and i gestehe that i &apos;ve never drink a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s tugendhaft . i &apos;m saying it &apos;s because identity is power .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people around us things that they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they &apos;re special .
my grandfather was in prison in prison .
my uncle died of alkoholinduzierten diseases .
and she believed that these are the issues that we need to care about .
i tried to say something about our justizsystem .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were 300,000 people in haftanstalten and in prison .
today , it &apos;s at 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest inhaftierungsrate of the world .
seven million people are released on bewährung , or bedingter strafaussetzung .
i think the world has changed our world is profoundly changed our world .
socially weak and black parts of the population of the population of despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male black schwarzen between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , in prison , or bedingter .
in urban communities everywhere in the country -- from los angeles , baltimore up to washington , until washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all black men either in jail in prison , in prison , in prison , or mit on bewährung .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with rassenzugehörigkeit , it &apos;s entstellt by poverty .
we have a justizsystem in this country that they treat much better when they &apos;re rich and guilty as poor and guilty .
wealth , not verschulden , affects the result .
but yet , we seem to be very happy .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we have lost contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a couple of hochinteressante developments .
my home home in alabama entzieht the wahlrecht when they strafrechtlich verurteilt .
here and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male population is lost her wahlrecht .
we prognostizieren that in 10 years , the percentage of the civic ehrenrechte will be so high as the verabschiedung of the wahlrechtsgesetzes .
the silence is ohrenbetäubend .
i vertrete children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world that dreizehnjährige children sentenced to death in prison .
in this country , there &apos;s a lot of strafaussetzung haftstrafen for children .
we already have a lot of effort .
the only country in the world .
i vertrete people in todeszellen .
the death penalty is an interesting question .
we believe because we &apos;ve taught it so that the real question is : did a man deserves a human being dying for one of them ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently , depending on how we see our identity .
the other view is not : did anybody make death for a crime , but : did we deserve it ?
i find that fascinating .
the death penalty death penalty is defined by error .
in nine people we &apos;ve executed , one of the things we were unschuldig , who we found for innocent , who was released and from death death row .
an amazing fehlerquote . one of nine innocent innocent .
i find that fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane , if for nine planes , the lift , a abstürzt .
but somehow , we do it , from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question , whether we &apos;re right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m beibringe in my students &apos;s history . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time against the end of the rekonstruktion , until the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
but for the men in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynchmobs .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped their lives .
now , these older people come to me and say , &quot; mr. , stevenson , you &apos;re talking to the people that are supposed to stop saying that we &apos;ve got to do it for the first time in our nation : 9 / 11 .
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after the terrorism , of course , of course , of course , the rassentrennung and decades of the rassistisch are motivated .
and yet there is a dynamic dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what makes our actions in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly hitting .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s very hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the rassentrennung is not to overcome it without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about the death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear you talk . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , it can never give you to germany . &quot;
it was silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our history , it &apos;s impossible that we &apos;ve ever ever ever known for the systematic to systematic people .
it would be gewissenlos of us , aware and people hinzurichten .
i thought about it .
it would feel like it would feel to live in a world where german the german state , especially when there was a lot of jews .
it would be unerträglich .
it would be gewissenlos .
and yet , here , in this country , in the states of the old , in the united states , is the risk of the old südens , 11 times higher , when the victim is weiß , at the age of black times , when the angeklagte is black and the victim knows -- in the same states , in their earth , the body is gelynchter .
and yet there &apos;s this mental abkopplung .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with these difficult subjects , these are the positive and wonderful things that are affected and wonderful things .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities of suffering , of suffering , abuse , ausgrenzung .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more engagement , to be in a complex world .
for me , it means money to start to think and talk about the poor , the benachteiligten , the ones that will never be at ted .
but think in a way that &apos;s embedded in our own life .
we all have to think of things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re rational , so we &apos;re rational .
innovation , creativity , and development isn &apos;t just from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s the kopf-herz-verbindung that i believe that it &apos;s not just open to all the light and begeisternden things , but also for the dark and problematischen .
vaclav havel , who said , one once said .
when we fought in eastern europe , we wanted to do anything , but what we needed most needed was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be able to be in hoffnungslosen places . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe that also must have to be engaged in it .
there &apos;s no line of technology and design that allows us to be completely human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , ausgrenzung and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is very much more of us than if we didn &apos;t take care of it .
it will deeply touch it .
as a young lawyer , i hatt the great privilege to meet the pink parks .
and then again , a woman came back to montgomery , where they had two of their oldest friends of traf. these older women , johnnie carr , who had these older women , and the unglaubliche -- and virginia durr , a white white , whose husband , clifford durr , dr. king vertrat .
so these women were meeting and they were easy .
and then , and then she carr me and he said , and she said , &quot; bryan , woman comes into the city . we want to talk .
do you want to dazukommen and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very happy . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and just stopped .
it was always so inspiring , so beflügelnd .
one day i was sitting there , and after a few hours , woman turned to me to say to me , &quot; well , i said , &quot; well , let me tell me what that is the same thing .
what are they trying to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to put in injustice against injustice .
people want to help people who were innocent .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the strafvollzugssystem .
we want to eliminate lebenslängliche haftstrafen without a variety of strafaussetzung for children .
we want to do something against the death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of death .
we want to eliminate masseninhaftierungen . &quot;
i was holding my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; mhmm . mhmm . &quot;
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to make them very , very tired . &quot;
and then she turned out to me , and i put a finger on my face , and he said , &quot; and that &apos;s why you have to be very , very tapfer . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i think the ted community should be tapferer .
we need to make ways to ask these challenges : these problems , that sorry .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity .
in my work , i learned a very simple thing .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
if somebody &apos;s lying , he &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone is taking something that , it &apos;s not just a dieb .
even who kills somebody is not just a killer .
and because this is that , there &apos;s a basic human dignity to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think in many places the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think that , even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so , in the end of our technology , we &apos;re not about the things that we &apos;re developing , not in the things that we &apos;re developing , not in our intellect and understood .
in the end of course , a society is not measured how they &apos;re treated their rich and powerful and the privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the verurteilten verurteilten , the inhaftierten .
because in this context , we start to understand the really amazing things that make us .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . it &apos;s a story .
sometimes i urge too much .
i &apos;m getting tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas go ahead of our thinking , in a very important way .
i vertrete these kids who have been convicted of very hard strafen .
i &apos;m going to go to the untersuchungsgefängnis and visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , which is supposed to stand as an adult .
then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn someone into something that he isn &apos;t ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed up too long , and i thought , my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he must have zauberkräfte .
right , bryan , the judge has zauberkräfte .
you should also wish that .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think more properly , i started working on a bill .
i had a 14jährigen , poor black boy as clients .
and i started with this bill . the headline was : &quot; bill , my arms , 14jährigen black customers like a privileged , white , 75jährigen topmanager .
in my antrag , i explained , i explained to staatsanwaltschaft and the police and the police as well .
there was a crazy line of that in this country , there &apos;s nothing that in this country is still error .
the next morning i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i had this crazy bill or i was actually writing this crazy bill .
and to my shock , i didn &apos;t just write him , but sent him to court .
a few months over , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to put in the court and this crazy case .
i went into the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
finally , i went out of my car , and i went to court .
when i had the court to the court , there was an elderly black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and umarmte me .
and then he did my ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , there was force .
it touched something deeply deep into me , identity , the ability of every single one to contribute to a community perspective .
well , i entered the gerichtssaal .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , did you put this crazy bill ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started discussing .
and more people came in , just because they were angry .
i wrote these crazy things .
polizeibeamte came in and stellvertretende staatsanwälte and office workers .
in the handumdrehen , the gerichtssaal was full of people who were angry , that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my augenwinkel , i saw the janitors on and down .
he always looked through the window , and he could hear the whole tohuwabohu .
he went on and down .
finally , this older black guy came with a very besorgten gesichtsausruck in the gerichtssaal and sat up right behind me , almost on the verteidigungsbank .
ten minutes later , the judge quit a break .
during the break , a polizeibeamter in which was worried that the janitors was in the gerichtssaal .
this deputy ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the gerichtssaal ? &quot;
he stood up . he looked at the deputy , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to talk about this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal of your eyes . don &apos;t give me . &quot;
i came to ted because i think that many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far worse , but that it &apos;s the justice of justice .
that we &apos;re not completely designed as humans , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and grundwerte .
that our survival of all of our survival is connected .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design and creativity and creativity with humanity , compassion and justice .
and most importantly , i want to see those of you who are just saying , just say , you don &apos;t lose the goal of your eyes . don &apos;t give up .
they &apos;ve seen in this audience , this community , a obvious desire and heard them to help them do something .
what else can we do ?
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a volksentscheid in this spring where it &apos;s about , actually , a effort to do , something from the geldstrom umzuleiten , who &apos;s flowing in the politics of punishment .
so here , in california , for example , in the next five years , you will be a billion dollars for the death sentence for the death penalty ausgeben. for a billion .
and yet , 46 percent of all tötungsdelikte isn &apos;t with a verhaftung .
56 percent of all vergewaltigungsfälle are not in trial .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
this referendum will suggest that the money is to invest in more and secure .
i think there are possibilities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the verbrechensrate in america in america .
and this is the fact often done in a context with increased inhaftierungszahlen .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of gewaltverbrechen hasn &apos;t changed .
most of the masseninhaftierungen in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of gewaltverbrechen .
it was the fehlgeleitete kreuzzug against drugs .
so the dramatic high numbers come in inmates .
we have hinreißen ourselves from the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have &quot; drei-verstöße &quot; -gesetze , &quot; for people to keep behind grid , for a fahrraddiebstahl , for the diebstahl of good , instead that you force it to give back the sacrifice .
i think we need to do more to help people who have victims of a straftat , not less .
and i think our current doesn &apos;t help anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
bryan , they really brought a string .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
bin laden is a increased gefahrenrisiko gefahrenrisiko .
famine in somalia : famine of the police sprecher of the police .
bösartige 4 . five : dangerous kreuzfahrtschiffe .
six : social decline : 65 : 65 dead .
eight : tsunamiwarnung . nine : cyber-attacken .
different speakers : drogenkrieg . mass of mass mass of mass weapons .
a recession . doomsday . egypt . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips i collected over the last six months -- but they &apos;ve also had the last six days , or the last six years .
in fact that the media is to show us negative topics , because our minds are exactly giving attention to these issues .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second , each day , our senses start much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because there &apos;s nothing more important than our survival , the first stop for all the information is a part of our temporallappens , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our frühwarnsystem , our gefahrendetektor .
it sortiert and durchkämmt the whole information on the search for any andeutung of danger in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old saying , &quot; if it blutet , the demand is , &quot; is very true .
now , with all of our digital devices that &apos;s seven days the week , 24 hours a day , all of this negative news , it &apos;s not a miracle we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s always going on the world .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
perhaps the enormous progress we &apos;ve done in the last century through a series of forces , so strong that it &apos;s going to be possible in the next three decades , to create a world of abundance .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we have no big problems -- climate crisis , artensterben , water and energieprobleme -- we have already .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at solving problems in a very long view , but eventually it &apos;s to overcome .
but let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so that we can predict the development .
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , that inflation durchschnittseinkommen of the world &apos;s population has tripled .
child mortality has a tenth .
and that &apos;s where the ernährungs- , elektrizitäts- transport- and communication costs are reduced to dramatically .
steve pinker showed us that we currently live in a very peaceful time in a very peaceful time .
and charles kenny is up by 25 percent in the last 130 years of 25 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we &apos;re going to increase our expectations constantly .
in fact , we have neu poverty .
remember that a great percentage of americans who live under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toilets , kühlschränken , tv , mobile phones , klimaanlagen , air , klimaanlagen and cars and cars .
the richest of the last century , the imperatoren of the earth , would never have been able to dream luxusgüter .
the basis of a lot of these form technologies , and they grow .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to to information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , is going to make great leaps , and the preis-performance-quotient doubled all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs in your pocket about a million times less and less than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
one , as smooth it comes up -- in good times , war or peace , recession , recession , depression , depression .
this is the result of faster computers that build faster computers .
it &apos;s slowed down for neither of our big problems .
also , despite her logarithmic , on the left , on the left , on the left up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to everyone .
&quot; cloud-computing , &quot; which is what i call sensors and networks , which is what i call sensors and networks , which is to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , fossil biology , and food , digital medicine , nano-materialien and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have the victory of ibms supercomputer watson at &quot; risk ? &quot;
that was great .
i was looking at the newspapers and for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson bezwingt human opponent . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence ran up every owner owner of any owner .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i here at ted is a new university called singularity university .
we bring all of our students all these technologies to focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we &apos;re asking the students , companies , products and services that live in a decade in a decade of life .
think about that a group of students can affect the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago that would have been ridiculous .
now , we can refer to dozens of companies that have been able to be able to do that .
when i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibilities .
it &apos;s about knappen goods .
so scarcity is kontextbezogen , and technology is an resources of befreiende force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of napoleon iii. in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
napoleons soldiers got silber-besteck , napoleon himself .
but the king of siam got aluminium-besteck .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and platin .
so this is why the dome of the washington-monuments was made of aluminum .
even though aluminium prozent percent , it &apos;s not , it &apos;s not a pure metal .
it &apos;s going to be connected to oxygen and silikate .
but then the technology of the elektrolyse was developed , so cheap , so cheap that we use it with our wegwerf-mentalität .
so let &apos;s put this analogy to the future .
we &apos;re thinking about energieknappheit today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that &apos;s filled with 5.000-mal more energy than we consume every year .
16 terawatt energy prasseln : all of the 88 minutes .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve been able to reduce the cost of solar forces in india to 50 percent of the diesel-stroms -- 8.8 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar , over the last year was 50 percent .
last month , this has published with a study that shows that until the end of this year in the sonnigen areas of the united states , the united areas of the united states in the usa areas , in comparison , compared to 15 cents at the national average .
and if we have a energieüberschuss , we &apos;re also going to have water .
let &apos;s talk about wasser-kriege .
do you remember it was in 1990 , in 1990 , in 1990 , when it was on saturn , back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a wasserplaneten .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s 97,5 percent saltwater , two percent vereist , and we &apos;re fighting to fight percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new nanotechnologien on the road , nano-materialien .
and this morning with dean with dean kaman with dean kaman , i want to share with dean kaman , i want to share with you -- his technolgie , who is called &quot; slingshot , &quot; and the many of you may have heard about it . it &apos;s the size of a kühlschranks .
it can generate a thousand gallons of clean drinking water a day out of various sources -- whether water , water , verschmutztes water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents a liter .
the chairman of coca-cola has just eingewilligt , a big test-projekt with a hundred units in developing countries .
and if everything is going well , and i &apos;m very confident , and then coca-cola is using this technology global countries across the planet .
this is technologieunterstützte innovation that exists today .
and we also saw this in mobile phones .
you know , my god , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of the mobile phones in developing countries in the end of 2013 .
just remember , that a massai-krieger with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better mobil-kommunikation than president reagan ago .
and if you look for your smartphone on google , you &apos;ve got more access to knowledge and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that information and communication and communication has abundance as no one ever could have predicted .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you and i have spent a couple of dollars -- gps , hd-video and photo , and libraries of books and music , technology to medical diagnostics -- literally werden and handy in your cell phone .
and the best part of it is possibly what &apos;s expected to do in health .
so in the last month , i had the pleasure called &quot; $ 10 million qualcomm tricorder x prize . &quot;
we &apos;re asking teams all over the world to connect all of these together in a cell so that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with the intelligence , you can test reinhusten or your blutwerte .
and to win , the device has to be a better diagnosis than a team hochqualifizierter doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the krankheitslast and 1.3 percent of healthcare workers .
if this device sequenced a rna- or a dna-virus , which is not known , it calls the heart disease and prevents a pandemic in front of its outbreak .
but now , the biggest force that will lead us to a world of surplus .
i call it &quot; the coming here . &quot;
the white lines stand for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the 7-milliarden-marke .
and by the way , the largest absicherung against an population population is a better education , and nutrition in the world .
in 2010 , we &apos;ve been connected in two billion people online .
by 2020 , we &apos;re going to voraussichtlich from two billion internetnutzer .
three billion new minds that we never heard before , will become global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what will you want ?
and instead of economic growth , i see one of the greatest economic anschübe of history .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars to flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be living through the use of the world &apos;s use , and they will be trained by the khan-akademie , and so that they &apos;re going to have the ability to use 3d printers and more productive than ever before .
so what can be 3 billion growing together , healthy , educated , productive members of the world ?
how about a set of new , never zuvor voices .
how about the oppressed , the oppressed , wherever they are , to give them a voice to pay attention and create change , for the first time ?
what will these three billion people will bring ?
how about beiträgen that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned by the x prize is that little teams that can create through passion and focus , extraordinary things , things that were able to create large companies and governments only in the past .
i want to conclude with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some perhaps you know .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will evolve .
we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medizinforschung .
so this has been a problem problem .
and this game was played by university university .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of thousands of people who played online .
and it showed that today the human recognition is better besser than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who was the best part of the world , it wasn &apos;t a mit-professor , not a caltech-student , in manchester , in manchester , a woman who was in the day , as an assistant in a reha-klinik , worked in a reha-klinik , and was the best part of the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what i have enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power today than individuals to make the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to an exponential technology .
we have the passion of a diy-innovatoren .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropen .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to master the new challenges , and to do this is necessary .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we have to do something about a verändernswertes piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor , and i am .
and maybe i &apos;ve been in business for a long time in business , as i can give it to give me a piece of my own wrong prestiges to give up this .
but before i come to the actual theme of my speech , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re nahe close to the world and move to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
now , &quot; moneyball &quot; appears soon , and about statistics , and it turns out to get a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to get in a statistics that i hope most of you have heard of .
it &apos;s the durchschnittsleistung of the schlägers .
we &apos;re talking about one 300 when a bat is 300 .
that means that the player is a player schlägt .
this is called the ball into the außenfeld , and he comes up , and he &apos;s coming up , and who is trying to throw it to the first base , it didn &apos;t have been done in time , and he was in safety .
three from 10 .
do you know how to call a 300ter in in baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a all-star .
you know how to call a 400ter ?
that &apos;s somebody who &apos;s safe to the rest of 10 .
legendär -- like ted williams legendär -- the last major league baseball player during a regulären season for 400 times over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine that i feel more comfortable in a few more comfortable , or maybe a little bit less likely i talked about it .
so suppose you &apos;ve got a blinddarmentzündung , and you know , you know , to a operateur , which is durchschnittsleistung 400 , its durchschnittsleistung 400 in terms of blinddarmentzündungen .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine it in a certain remote area , and you have a loved people with verstopften , and you have your hausarzt überweist that to a kardiologen , which is durchschnittsleistung at gefäßdarstellung .
but , but you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better this year . it &apos;s the aufsteigenden branch .
and it &apos;s schlägt .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you believe like durchschnittsleistung for a nurse or a nurse or a nurse , or a orthopäden , a geburtshelfer , should be a rettungsassistenten ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in the whole medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor should be .
however , what we do is that we &apos;re every one of them , including me , in the world .
never make a mistake , no one does the details of the details of thinking about how that should be done .
and this is the message that i put in medical school .
i was a zwanghaft student .
in high school , a mitschüler was told in the school that brian goldmann would learn for a bluttest .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little dachstube in the sisters in the toronto general hospital , unweit from here .
i learned everything .
in my anatomievorlesung , i learned the origins and tail every branch branch , every branch of every branch of the aorta , which of the aorta , obskure and ordinary differentialdiagnosen .
i even knew the differentialdiagnose to klassifizieren azidose azidose .
and that &apos;s a lot of time , i collected more and more .
and i was good , i schloss with cum laude .
and i left the medical school with the impression that i knew , if i memorized everything , or at least as much as possible , as possible as possible , that i was immune to make a immune against that .
and it worked for a time until i met a woman .
i was gebracht in a lehrkrankenhaus here in toronto when a woman was brought to me in the hospital in the hospital .
at that time , i was a kardiologischen layer on the kardiologischen service .
and it was my assignment when the notfallpersonal kardiologischen rat advice to study the notfallpatienten .
to give them to my oberarzt .
i studied my wife , and she was in atemnot .
and when i communicate to her , they made keuchende sounds .
and when i abhörte her chest , i was able to hear a knackendes sound on both sides , told me that she was suffering under kongestiver failure .
this is a state where the heart fails , instead of putting the entire blood on the blood , a part of the blood in the lung , and this gradually , that &apos;s why the kurzatmigkeit came out .
and that was not a tough diagnosis .
i hired them and made me the treatment .
i gave her aspirin . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call diuretics , water pills , so that she ausschied the liquid .
and over a period and a half to two hours , they started to feel better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without my oberarzt .
i didn &apos;t take the on to it , and did what i should have been a call with him , so that he would have had a chance to make a chance of his own image .
and he knew it , he would have been able to get more additional information to her beizusteuern .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a medical doctor .
maybe i was going to be able to take responsibility to take responsibility that i was like this , and i would be able to worry about my patients without having to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
and so that i sent them home , i &apos;m a quiet voice in me , and i was trying to say , &quot; goldman , not a good idea . &quot;
in fact , i didn &apos;t feel so much of the nurse that i asked a nurse , which is a woman , &quot; do you think that &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and he said , &quot; yeah , i think it will go well . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
so i unterzeichnete the entlassungspapiere and an ambulance and rettungsassistenten and they took them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this nagende feeling of my stomach .
but i kept working .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , down the hospital and went to a lot of the car to drive home with the car when i did something else .
i went home on my way .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen the woman , but another three words to me , and these three words , most of the notfallärzte i know .
other medical men are not afraid of it , but the notfallmedizin is very special , because we can see the patients .
the three words , do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients that they thought after home ? &quot;
asked the nurse sachlich .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular tonlage .
so she was back .
she was back and they die .
about an hour after that she sent home , after i sent her home , she collapsed and the family called in the family , and the family brought them back to the notfallstation with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous schockzustand .
they &apos;re very breathing , and they were blue .
the notfallpersonal moved all strands .
they gave her blutdruckerhöher .
they closed them into the beatmungsmaschine .
i was shocked . i was shocked .
and i went through this rollercoaster , because it was after the stabilisation in intensive care , and i hoped she would recover .
and after two , three days , it was clear that she never would , again .
she had not suffered einen .
her family got together .
and over the course of eight or nine days , they created the geschehenen .
the neuten day , she liesen them -- woman printer printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say , you know , you don &apos;t forget the names of that .
and that was the first time i learned this .
and the next couple of weeks to me , and i found that for the first weeks , and i was the first time that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , not isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you &apos;re all familiar with all of the healthy shame , when you have a friend of the best friend , if you have a friend of the best friend , and you get a terrible argument , and the best friend , when you get a terrible discussion , but the bad one that you don &apos;t make a mistake like that .
if you &apos;re doing wiedergutmachung , you never make mistakes .
this is the kind of lehrreicher shame .
the ungesunde way i &apos;m talking about , is what makes a sick in innersten .
it &apos;s the one who says it &apos;s not what you &apos;re doing it &apos;s bad , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t on the bottom of my oberarztes , he was very dear .
he talked about the family , and i &apos;m sure he was looking at the wogen and sure that i wouldn &apos;t be sued .
but i asked these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the oberarzt ? why do i get them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
but it certainly put it .
i started to feel better .
and then on a bewölkten day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke out , and i said , maybe i can feel better .
and i was saying that if i doubled my efforts to perfection , and never again , if i doubled my efforts to perfection , and never once again , that the voice could be verstummen .
and she did .
and i continued to work .
and then it happened .
two years later , i had a service in notfallstation in a kommunalen hospital north of toronto and i begutachtete a 25 year-old man with gereiztem rachen .
it was a lot and i &apos;m in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked into the rachen , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and he sent him .
and even when he went out of the door , he showed up on his rachen .
two days later , i came to my office , and my chefärztin asked me to do a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the gereizten ? &quot;
it turns out he &apos;s a streptokokken-infektion .
he had an potentially lebensgefährliche disease called epiglottitis .
you can google that , but it &apos;s not an infection on the top of the rachens , but it is the top of the rachens .
and fortunately , he died .
he got intravenöse antibotica , and he recovered a few days later .
and i went back to the same tortur of shame and selbstzweifel , and i felt liberated , and went to work to work until again and again and again .
in a notfallschicht , i &apos;ve missed two times .
there &apos;s a lot of things about that , especially if you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital , that &apos;s just 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was probably no mängel in their treatment .
and he would have nierensteine .
i ordnete the röntgen of the kidneys . when it was befund , my colleague , the patient at the patient &apos;s side , in the patient , in the patient , in the bottom of the patient , called a verhärtung .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i ordnete to rehydrieren him , and asked my colleagues to evaluate my colleagues as well .
and he did , and he said , when he &apos;s a verhärtung in the lower sector , he called the operateure .
in both cases , operierte and it was fine .
both of the time to me , fraßen me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the five five years , which is a lot of my colleagues saying , but total nonsense .
some of my klöpse happened happened in the last five years .
alone , ashamed and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t end with my mistakes and you can talk about you , if i get the quiet voice to tell me what really did not find , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my fault , so they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i was in a room -- like now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you talk the last time you heard about fehlschlag about fehlschlag over fehlschlag ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about your mistakes .
if i &apos;d come with colleagues a room with colleagues and to tell you what i just told you about , i would probably not have the end of the second story of the second story before you , before you , someone would have a joke , you &apos;d forget a joke and forget the rest of it .
and actually , if i knew , or my colleagues , that a orthopäde in my hospital would have lost the wrong leg , then they believe me , i could have trouble looking into the eyes .
this is the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do . the ones that einschränkt einschränkt , and that einschränkt and that einschränkt , and that with bad outcomes , with bad outcomes , and with good results .
it &apos;s almost an antibody response like antibodies antibodies attack people .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we make the mistakes that make mistakes from medicine , that we have a safe system .
but there are two problems .
and in my 20 years of medical and journalism , i &apos;ve made a personal medical study of medical mistakes and falsche treatments , to me , so all of my first article that i &apos;ve been able to see for the toronto star star , black coat , black ways .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely unumgänglich .
we &apos;re working in a system in a system where one 10 medikationen can &apos;t either be a false or wrong in the krankenhausinfektionen , and more and more and more and zahlreicher and zahlreicher and zahlreicher .
in this state , about 24,000 kanadier will die about umgänglichen mistakes .
in the united states , the institute has put the institute at the number of 100,000 .
both of them are strong untertreibungen , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as much as we should .
and it &apos;s the crux .
in a krankenhaussystem where the medical knowledge , all two to three to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
schlafmangel is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake , so that we have to take a perfect krankheitsverlauf for a patient to a patient .
then i take the same patient with brustschmerz , making it verschwitzt and geschwätzig and gebe , and give it a slightly alkoholisierten breath , and suddenly , the story is durchsetzt with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same along .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of that is the error inevitable .
so if you take the system so that , as i was taught , and all of the fehlerbehafteten , then there &apos;s no longer left .
and you know the leier about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
i &apos;d say , &quot; white coat , black species &quot; i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about her ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show him the microphone microphone .
and then they expand , they &apos;re in front of the head , and then look down and eat hard , and start to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t do the same mistake i &apos;m fabrizierte . &quot;
what you need is an environment that you can do in it .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new defined doctor is a person , to know about his humanity , accepted his humanity , will not be proud of making mistakes , but all of it to learn from them , so that it can be passed on .
she shares their experiences with others .
it supports the rest of your mistakes .
and it turns out to others , not about bloßzustellen , but in a loving , supportive way all of this benefit .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognized that people make the system with life , and if that &apos;s like that , people do some mistakes time .
and the system that the system is going to be able to find some mistakes , to try to find the spaces that people who are going to be able to find their health , and they can actually respond to the amount of potential , which is going to be rewarded , in fact , and that &apos;s going to be rewarded for people like me , making mistakes , and should be rewarded for the begradigung of that rewarded .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the new medical doctor .
i &apos;m a person . i make mistakes .
but i &apos;m going to be bedaure das. , but i &apos;m best trying to learn to get it to others .
i don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about veränderbare normwerte .
and because you can tell this idea in one minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories to use time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know he was 1835 here .
you may think he jagte finken , but that &apos;s not true .
they actually collected fish fish .
he described one of them as a very &quot; usually . &quot;
it was a zackenbarsch .
until the &apos; 80s , he was in a great style .
now , it &apos;s on the red list .
so this story we &apos;ve heard a lot of times from the galapagos or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
and yet , we still come on the galapagos .
we still think , they were originally .
they &apos;re still describing them as pristine .
what &apos;s going on here ?
the second story is supposed to be a different concept that veränderbare taillenweite .
because i experienced it when i was a 1971 in 1971 in college .
i went there , because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad sonnenbrand , and i was convinced that i really didn &apos;t get out of there .
it was my first sonnenbrand .
as you can see , the lagoon was palmen and a few mangroven umsäumt .
there was buntbarsche of about 20 inches , schwarzkinnmaulbrüter , a unterart of the buntbarsche .
the fischgründe of these buntbarsche were very ertragreich , and the fishermen lived well and they were making more of them in ghana .
when i returned for 27 years later , the fish geschrumpft was geschrumpft on half .
adults measure it five centimeters .
they were genetically erdrückt .
there were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the happiness to be there .
so it has nothing changed , and yet everything changed .
my third little story tells me from the introduction of schleppnetzfischerei in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- rather at the beginning of the &apos; 60s -- förderte europe .
fischförderung meant countries that were already 100,000 fish , and the industrial fishing , which is a very ugly ship called mutiara 4 .
i went on to this , and we did it in all the southern südchinesischen of the ocean and especially in the javasee .
we had no words for what we started there .
now i know that it was the cause of the ocean .
90 percent of our fangs were sponges , other animals that are connected to the bottom .
the largest part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble , were korallenriff-fische .
and essentially , the bottom of the ocean came on deck and then became zurückgeworfen .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
within a year , you take a survey , and then you start with the working fishing .
the reason is going to change , in this case , in this case , a hard reason , or soft corals will matschiger .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t eat , you threw them away because they were dead .
suddenly , we started .
she wasn &apos;t ertrunken .
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat well .
in fact , that &apos;s going to come up from trümmern every time of each other , if they drive into areas that never have been fish .
but it won &apos;t be documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we &apos;re going to fit the new level of the new level and don &apos;t call us in a reminder of what was there .
this is what happens .
on the y-axis are a few good things : biodiversity biodiversity , number of orca , the green of their country , the wasservorrat .
in time , it changes . it changes because for people , of course , of course .
and every generation of the pictures of the images of your conscious life is the standard of your conscious life , as standard and it &apos;s going to escape everything .
the difference is going to be seen as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can give a sequence of changes .
and at the end , they just got the erbärmlichen remains remains remains remains .
right now , that &apos;s largely our goal .
we want to preserve things that are disappeared or things that are not like they were .
you might think that the problem of people who certainly lived when they were in räuberischen societies , and killing animals only after a few generations , what they had done .
because obviously , an animal that made it very often was rarely before before it ausstirbt .
so , you don &apos;t often lose animal animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a loss .
we &apos;re going to focus on the very large animals , and in the ocean , these are the big fish .
they &apos;re less likely because we &apos;re going to catch them .
at the time , there &apos;s little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the normwert .
the question is why people accept that .
now , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , a lot of people will realize that it was really different .
they &apos;re going to confirm it , because the evidence of the evidence , they &apos;re not like the evidence that they would like the evidence .
so , for example , for example , for example , for example , the report of a kapitäns that observed in this area can &apos;t be able to be able to be used , or not normally by fischereiwissenschaftlern , because he &apos;s not &quot; scientifically . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous big role that can play a marine area .
because in meeresschutzgebiete , we &apos;re basically doing the past .
we &apos;re making the past the past that people can &apos;t understand , because they have changed and very low .
so the people who are able to see a marine area , and that benefit from the insight that allows you to have your normwerte .
what about the people who don &apos;t do that , because they don &apos;t have access to -- the people in the middle west ?
here , i think the art and film and film might fill the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
there were grauwale a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
and the farbtöne and the -schattierungen , maybe you might remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why the people have been able to be touched -- apart from the pocahontas-geschichte , why were they touched by the bilderwelt ?
because there &apos;s something that lost in a way that lost in a way .
so i mean , you know , the only one that i &apos;m going to give you to cameron , so he &apos;s spinning the avatar ii .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist , in communist , if you had a typewriter , you had to have a typewriter in the government .
they also had to registrieren a leaf with beispieltext from that typewriter .
the reason for this : the government could track , where a text came from .
found an article with falschem gedankengut , and they could detect the creator of these thoughts .
and in the west , we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do something like that , and how much that was due to speech speech .
in our own countries , we would never do something like that .
but if you buy a new farblaserdrucker of the top of 2011 , and then you print a page , this page is bright yellow flecke on every page , in a pattern , in a pattern , which is clear to you , and you make your printer .
this is what happens today .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be aufzuregen .
and this was an example of what our own governments are the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three hauptquellen from these places today .
let &apos;s look at what really happens in the world : we can divide the attacks in categories .
we have three hauptgruppen .
there are online-kriminelle .
for example , this is mr. dimitry golubow from kiew in ukraine .
and the motives of online-kriminellen are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use online-angriffe to make a lot of money , a huge pile of money .
there are several known cases of online-millionären , multimillionären , who made their money through attacks .
this is wladimir tsastsin from tartu in estonia .
this is alfred gonzalez .
stephen watts .
björn sundin .
this is matthew anderson , tariq al-daour and so on .
these people come online online , but they have acquired it , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , to get money out of our bankkonten , as we do , or also keylogger , that have collected our kredikarteninformationen on the input , while we &apos;re playing over an infected computer online .
the u.s. intelligence account for two months ago , the swiss intelligence account of mr. sam jain , and on this account , 14,9 million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain itself is based on free feet , which is unknown .
and i &apos;m going to argue that today is that we &apos;re going to become victims of an online-verbrechens in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be worse .
most of the crimes will play online .
the second largest angreifergruppe that we see today are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , an opinion , or through their audience .
anonymous are over the last 12 months , and they have become one of the hauptspieler in the field of online-angriffe .
so these are the three hauptangriffsgruppen : criminals who are doing it for doing the money , like anonymous , as anonymous , but the last group are nations , governments who run attacks .
that &apos;s where we have cases of fälle .
it shows a great model what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
diginotar is a vollmachtszertifikat from the netherlands -- or it was that .
in the last fall , there had to be insolvenz , because diginotar had been hacked .
someone was hacked , and had been gründlich .
and last week in a meeting with dutch regierungsvertretern , i asked one of the leitenden of this group to ask if he made it possible for possible because of the diginotar-hacks people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die in a row such remote ?
diginotar is a zertifizierungsstelle .
they sell zertifikate .
what do you do with zertifikaten ?
now , a certificate , you need a certificate with https , for example , with ssl-verschlüsselten service , for example .
now , we all use , or a lot of us , or a lot of us , or a lot of us , or a lot of our competitors , or a lot of us , you know , and you know , you know , you know , because you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , that the local government , so that the local government can &apos;t be in your conversation .
do you know , if you &apos;re a foreign man .
zertifizierungsbehörde hacken and gefälschte zertifikate .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of diginotar .
how about the arab spring and the things that happened in egypt ?
now , in egypt , the united states , in april , the united headquarters the egyptian geheimpolizei in april , and they found a lot of records .
in this files , a folder called &quot; finfisher . &quot;
and in this folder , notes were in a community company who had sold egyptian government a few programs that they were able to capture -- in very large framework -- any communication of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for 280.000 euros to the egyptian government .
the firmenhauptquartier is right here .
so western governments are killing governments with hilfsmitteln governments , for their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago , it was found out a few weeks ago , and this was a trojaner that was used by german regierungsvertretern to bespitzeln their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be in a kriminalfall verdächtigt , it &apos;s pretty much for your phone .
but today we are far beyond .
they tap their internet connection .
they use tools like the staatstrojaner , to bespielen their computers with a trojaner that allows them to monitor their entire communication , their online-diskussionen , to collect their passwörter .
so if we keep thinking further about these things , the obvious answer would be people : &quot; ok , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter to me because i &apos;m a braver citizen citizens .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy must be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we have today , in 2011 , our governments , we may have trust our governments , but every right , that we &apos;re going to be emitted for forever .
and we trust , we &apos;re blind , is we trust every future government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of betonblocksteinen .
the first betonblocksteine were produced , and entstammten a simple idea , a simple idea , of a simple idea , module maßen with some given measurements that fit .
betonbausteine were very rapidly die in the world .
they put us up to build things that were larger than we , buildings , building bridges , after the other .
basically , the betonbaustein has become the block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , the lego came out with this .
it was called verbindende stone .
and within a few years , lego moved to every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 rocks for each person on the planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful homes , beautiful bridges , beautiful building .
lego made it possible for everyone .
lego basically has the betonbaustein building block , the building block of the world , and made a building block for our imagination .
meanwhile , in the same year , bell , at bell the next year , the next revolution announced the next building revolution , the next building block .
the transistor was a little plastikeinheit , which was a world of static , aufeinandergestapelten building blocks in a world that would be interactive .
like the betonblock , the transistor allows us to build a lot more complex and more complex , a stone after another .
but there &apos;s a hauptunterschied : the transistor was just experts .
and personally , i don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time for experts , and so i decided to change this .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to put the power of the engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing littlebits .
let me show you how they work .
littlebits are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re vorgefertigt , light , clay and sensor .
and the best part of it is that they connect with magnets .
that &apos;s how they can &apos;t build them wrong .
the stones are farbcodiert .
green is a copy , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange .
so everything you have to do is to connect a blue and one another one to one another , and you can build them very quickly .
they put a blue one on a green one , and they can make light .
they can put a switch in between , and they made a little dimmer .
take the switch out to a pulsmodul , which is , einzufügen , and you &apos;ve made a little blinker .
add this buzzer for one extra effect , and you &apos;ve made a lärmmaschine .
i &apos;ll stop that .
beyond the simple play , littlebits actually is quite powerful .
instead of having to code , you know , programming , verdrahten or löten , allows you to do with easy gestures to program intuitive gestures .
so , in order to slow up or slow down , just turn that button , and it &apos;s going to make the impulse faster or slower .
the idea behind the littlebits is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction in the world into a gebrauchsfertigen stone .
lights , sound , solarelemente , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve spread littlebits to kids , and they &apos;re looking at them .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , as you start to understand the electronics in your life , and you don &apos;t learn them in school .
like , for example , a nachtlicht works , or why the doors will respond to the aufzugs of the aufzugs , or a touch .
we also got littlebits too .
so , for example , we had no experience with no experience in electronic things that started to play with littlebits as a material .
here we see , with filz , paper and water bottles , like geordie ...
a couple of weeks ago , we gave risd to risd , and we gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; power . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a bewegungsgesteuerte konfetti-kanone .
but wait , this is really my lieblings-projekt .
it &apos;s a hummer from play-doh , which is fear in the darkness .
and for those nicht-ingenieure , littlebits , was another material , and electronics was just another .
and we want to make this material available for all .
so it &apos;s open source .
you can go to the website , you can go all designvorlagen and make them yourself .
we want the world of creators , the creator , the inventor , the mitwirkenden , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
so , pull out and start to invent them .
thank you .
