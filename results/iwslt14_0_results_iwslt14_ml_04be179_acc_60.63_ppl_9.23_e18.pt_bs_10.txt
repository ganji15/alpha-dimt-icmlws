you know , one of the great vernügen learning about traveling and one of the pleasures of ethnographischen research is in common with the people who can remember the old days . that their past the wind still feel in the wind , they touch them from the rain geglätteten stones , sie them in the bitter branches of plants .
and the idea of the ältesten of the inuit means is , is that the idea that the world we &apos;re living in , is the idea that the world we live in an absolute sense of an absolute sense , but just as a model of reality , as a result of a group of a group of opportunities , as a result of a group of opportunities that our ancestors had , even successful , selected in many generations .
and of course , we share all the same anpassungsnotwendigkeiten .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing kids to the world .
we go through initiationsrituale .
we need to deal with the unaufhaltsamen separation of separation from death through death , and so we should not surprise that we all sing , dancing and art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique inflection of liedes , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about penan in the anden , or a karawanserei in the middle of the sahara , and that happens to be the colleague that i traveled to the desert a month ago , or even a yak-hirte in the hängen , everest , everest , the world &apos;s gottmutter .
all of these people teach us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of understanding on earth .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , it &apos;s only possible for hope .
together , the myriad cultures of the world are a network of spirituellem and kulturellem life , which is the earth umhüllt and for the earth is as important , as the biological lebensnetz that you know as biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural lebensnetz as a ethnosphäre , and ethnosphäre can be defined as the gesamtsumme of all thoughts and dreams , myths ideas , inspiration and intuitions , which has been defined by the beginnings of consciousness since the beginnings of consciousness .
the ethnosphäre is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are , and what we &apos;ve been able to be able to do as an amazing wissbegierige species .
and just as the biosphere , the biosphere , this is what happened with the ethnosphäre .
no biologist would be able to say that 50 percent , for instance , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the apokalyptischste szenarium in the field of biological diversity -- is almost the equivalent of what &apos;s known to us as a optimistischstes szenarium in cultural diversity .
and the key indicator of this is the extinction of languages .
when any of you were born in this room , 6,000 languages were talked about .
now , a language is not just the sum of the vokabulars or a series of grammatikregeln .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a particular culture finds access to the tangible world .
each language is like a altbestehender forest of the mind , an inflection point , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and by these 6,000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey here , you don &apos;t have half the ears in monterey .
they don &apos;t have taught to be taught anymore . that means , if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually already dead .
what might be lonely as the silence of being umhüllt , one of the last of your people who speak your language , no way to have a chance to share the wisdom of the ancestors , or expect the hope ?
and yet , this terrible fate , actually , to someone around the earth , about every two weeks , because of every two weeks , an elderly dies , and taking the last silben of an old language .
and i know some of you can say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t it be a better place , if we were all going to speak a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let this language be yoruba . let &apos;s be kantonesisch . &quot;
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
and then you would suddenly recognize how it would be if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so i want to take you in a trip today on a journey through the ethnosphäre , a short journey through the ethnosphäre to try to understand what was actually lost .
now , there are some among us , in a sense , that i think , when i say , when i say , &quot; different ways of being , &quot; really different possibilities of being .
for example , for example , for example , for example , take this child in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the anakonda , believe that they mythologisch the milchfluss from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
this is a people which isn &apos;t different between the colors of blue and green , because the himmelszelt forest is the forest of the forest , which people are dependent between .
they have a strange language and a heiratsvorschrift that &apos;s called the linguistic exogamie : you have to marry someone who talks to another language .
all of these roots in the ancient past past , and the curious about these big houses , because of the mischehen , six or seven languages , is that you never hear someone who learns a language .
they just stop and start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the waorani in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people who first got back in 1958 .
in 1957 , in 1957 , there were trying to absorb five missionare and made a schwerwiegenden mistake .
they warfen glänzende photos from the air , which we would evaluate as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people had never seen anything zweidimensionales in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , trying to figure out the face or the character , found nothing and schlussfolgerten , that this was killing the business business business business and killed the five missionare with the spear .
but the waorani were not just killing the spear .
they durchbohrten each other .
54 percent of deaths happen by durchbohrungen .
we followed eight generations of eight generations and found two cases of a natural death , and when we ausfragten people with a nachdruck , they gave them that one of the people turned so old that he had died because of his age , and we killed him with the spear .
but at the same time they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps of distance and determine what animal species of this owned .
i had a really amazing job when my professor at harvard got to go to haiti at the time , and the secret societies that were the foundation of the power of the power of duvalier and the poison that was used to be used to make zombies , to make sure .
so to give a sense of this sensation , i had a little bit of , of course , of course , about this remarkable belief , of course , not a kult of the black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysische worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask you , you know , the big world religions , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , buddhismus , or whatever .
a continent will always leave out , because the guess was that sub-saharan africa was not a religious belief , and of course , of course , of course , and , of course , in sub-saharan the absence of these very profound religious thoughts , which is the tragic diaspora of sklavereizeit herüberkamen .
but what makes it interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living giving birth to the spirits .
the minds can become from under the big water , answers to the rhythm of dance , to have the soul of the living length of the living for a very glänzenden moment to god .
deshab likes to say , &quot; your white is going to church , you talk about god .
we are dancing in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re being taken by the mind . how can you do harm ?
look at this amazing demonstrations : voodoo-akolythen in a trancezustand , die coal , which is an amazing visualization of the spirit of the mind that this mind is going to be aushält if it &apos;s versetzt into a certain state .
now , of all the people i met , the kogi from the sierra nevada de santa marta in nordkolumbien , the most extraordinary .
progeny from the old tyrannischen civilization , the caribbean the caribbean küstenebene from colombia , and in the aftermath of the eroberung , this people moved into a isoliertes vulkanisches mass of the karibischen over the karibischen küstenebene .
in a blutbefleckten continent , these people were the only ones who have never been conquered .
until today &apos;s day , you will be governed by a ritual priesthood , but education is very extraordinary .
in the age of three and four years of finsternis , in steinhütten , at the base of the glacier for 18 years , in steinhütten -- two periods of zeiträume , two periods of time to mimic the nine months of pregnancy , mimic the nine months of pregnancy who spent them in the lap of their leiblichen mother , they &apos;re now metamorphorisch in the lap of the great mother .
and throughout that time , they &apos;re culturally introduced to the values of their society , values that sustain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic sense , or we can maintain the ecological balance .
and in the end of the first light , when the sun begins to take out of the astonishing beautiful landscape , all of all of a sudden , what you &apos;ve learned in the abstract in the abstract pracht , and the priests comes back and the priest goes back and says , &quot; you see , you know , it &apos;s really , as i told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call them the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , to the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think of native and we think old and the old gerücht of the fancy wild herauf , which is a rassistischer thought , or the other , and saying , these people are connected to nature , than we .
so , they &apos;re neither sentimental , they &apos;re not going to be sentimental yet .
it &apos;s not a lot of room for this malariaverseuchten sümpfen of the earth , but it &apos;s shaped by the idea of being aware of the idea of being aware of it , but on a very weit intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist , because it &apos;s going to be conscious of human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid out the andes that grows up to be a very different child , and a different relationship to this resource or this resource , as a small child from montana , which grows up in the belief that a mountain is a pile of stones that can be worn .
whether it &apos;s a aufenthaltsort of a mind or a bunch of erz is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the nature of nature .
i grew up in the forests of britisch colombia and believed that these forests are there to be gerodet .
and that led me to another person as my friends under the kwakiutl who believe that these forests are involved in the aufenthaltsort of hukuk and the gebogenen minds and the kannibalischen ghosts of the world who are involved in the world , ghosts that they would participate in their hamatsa-initiation .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can see some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took only last april in the amazon of the amazon .
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard , the most powerful psychoaktive preparation of the repertoire .
so , it &apos;s not just going to do two different sources , and it &apos;s not just to have the potential potential of this präparats , it &apos;s not just to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to deliver about as if a blue trüber smoke on your consciousness , however , but with the leaves the leaves the leaves of a strauchs from the family of kaffeepflanzen to the name of psychotria viridis .
this plant contains some very strong tryptamine that are very similar to serotonin , dimethyltryptamin-5 and methoxydimethyltryptamin .
if you &apos;ve seen the yanomami , as you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this substance that it contains in different ways also enthält .
this powder is about as much as you get shot from a gewehrlauf of barocken paintings of barocken paintings and landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to verzerrung reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have launched with my professor , richard evan shultes , the man who &apos;s been discussing the man &apos;s psychedelische mit with discovering this . i argued that you couldn &apos;t put this tryptamine as a halluzinogen , because the moment you feel that you feel that you &apos;re not there anymore to experience a halluzination .
but the thing about tryptaminen is that they can &apos;t be taken oral , because they &apos;re , of course , by the human gut vorkommendes vorkommendes , of course , of course , with names of monoamin-oxidase , mit .
you can only be taken in conjunction with some other chemicals that mao denaturieren .
now what &apos;s fascinating is that the betakarboline that have been in the liane , in the liane , are mao-inhibitoren of exactly the species that are necessary to potenzieren . so , ask yourself .
how can these people have nicht plants of the 80,000 plants of plants are going to find these two morphologisch plants , which , when it combined in this way , creating a kind of biochemischer version , so that the whole greater than the sum of its parts is ?
we use this great euphemism , trial and errors , which it turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask the indians , they say , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , cofan , 17 , 17 varieties of ayahuasca that you can see in a forest &apos;s forest in the forest of the forest that you see as a way .
and then you ask them to look at their taxonomie , and they say , &quot; i thought you know something about plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you take each of the 17 variants in vollmond and you &apos;re singing to one in a different tonlage .
now that doesn &apos;t make you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting .
well the problem is , even those who have sympathy for the difficult position of native wildlife , they have as orginiell and farbenfroh , but they &apos;re sort of kind of just the past the past , as the real world , in the real world , that means our world .
so , the fact is that , in the 20th century , it &apos;s not going to be remembered in the 20th century , but rather than an era where we were present , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on the earth is either aktiv or passively , so the problem is not the change .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new lebenmöglichkeiten .
and the problem is not the technology .
the sioux-indianer were not going to be less to be less than to be less than to be less in the sioux and the arrow of the arrow , when they stopped being americans , when they were horse and pferdewagen tasks .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of ethnosphäre , and it &apos;s power . the ugly face of rule .
and so , in the world of abholzung , whether it &apos;s living in the world &apos;s wald , it &apos;s going to be verschmutzt by erkennbare völker , which seems to be willing to see the schiffsräume with raw baumstämmen with raw pieces of raw baumstämmen that you have the forest entrissen , or as you know , in the case of the yanomami , where it &apos;s krankheitsträger , that have been krankheitsträger , who have been krankheitsträger during the goldrauschs .
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i work a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of the political domination .
you know , the genocide , the phyische extinction of people is going to be convicted , but the destruction of the lives of the people will not only be convicted , but generally , and vielerorts as part of a entwicklungsstrategie .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of tibets if you haven &apos;t seen it on unterster .
i went to lhasa miles from chengdu in westchina , after lhasa miles from südost-tibet in westchina , and when i woke up the face , i saw the statistics of the statistics that you hear . 6,000 holy monuments of monuments , 1.2 million people that were killed during the cultural revolution .
the father of this young manns was identified as his followers &apos;s followers .
that meant that he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle floh with her holiness in the diaspora , who brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked locked up as punishment for the crime .
he was in the age of two years in the prison to hide under her rockzipfel , because she couldn &apos;t live without him .
the sister who did this brave did become a erziehungslager .
one day , she came out on a armband , and she had to put them on a armband for seven years arbeitslager .
the suffering can be unerträglich , but the erlösende spirit of people is something unvergessliches .
and in the end , we &apos;re really going to have a choice . we would like to do a monochromatischen world , or in a polychromatischen world &apos;s world ?
margaret mead , said that it &apos;s her greatest fear that , as margaret mead said , we &apos;re not just the whole range of the whole range of thinking about all the range of human imagination in a eingeengte way of thinking about it , but we wake up from a dream of thinking , and forgotten that someday there .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species may have been there for 600,000 years .
the neolithische revolution that brought us to agriculture and us at that moment of saatkorns unterwarf , the poetry of the priesthood of the priesthood &apos;s prose and a hierarchy , specialization and surplus -- was only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all respond to the challenges we have in the ensuing millennia .
if we ask these thousands of weltkulturen after the importance of the human wonder , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we will wiederentdecken the possibility of what we are , people with full consciousness , with full consciousness , the importance of the importance of the importance that all the people and gardens have to thrive , have to be zugesichert , and there are great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph that i took in the northern end of the baffin-inseln , when i went to the narwhal-jagd , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the 50iger years of the etablierung of our regime , they were forced to pull them in settlements .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather refused .
the family , fear of his life , took all of the guns and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit are not afraid of the cold ; they use them to their advantage .
the gleitschienen of their sled were originally made of fish that was wrapped in karibu-haut .
the man &apos;s grandfather was not afraid of the arctic night or the white storm .
he schlüpfte out , leaving his pants out of seehundsfell , leaving his pants from seehundsfell and defäkierte into his hand , and when the feces began to cold , he formed it into the form of a messers .
he sprühte speichel on the sides of the fäkalien-messers , and when it was completely frozen , he erstach a dog .
he enthäutete the dog and improvisierte a geschirr , nahm the skeleton of the dog and improvisierte a sled , improvisierte a single dog , improvisierte , improvisierte , über over the eisschollen of the dog gürtel .
you can do nothing out of anything .
and this is a symbol in many ways that a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all the native people around the world .
the canadian government gave the complete control in april in april 1999 , the complete control of an area that &apos;s bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunavut .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all the mineralvorkommen .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can search for and reach with his people .
and finally , i think it &apos;s quite obvious , at least for those of us who are moving to these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not removed at all .
they &apos;re the heimatländer of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination , zurückreichen in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , how the dreams of our own children are part of geography .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we believe politicians never achieve anything .
we think that polemik -- we believe that polemik is not convincing , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world , and our website get 35 million hits every month .
156 nations senden our fernsehkanal .
our magazines are read about millions .
and we &apos;re going to take a series of trips to the ethnosphäre , that you know , and we &apos;re going to take a lot of trips to the ethnosphäre , that world that world has made it in different ways , in different ways , that we can find a lebensmöglichkeit in a really multicultural pluralistischen world , where we can contribute to the wisdom of all people contributing to our shared well-being .
thank you .
what i first will show you is the basic work that we have microsoft as part of a year ago , just one year , and that &apos;s seadragon . and it &apos;s an environment where you can actually deal with local or removed with huge amounts of visual data .
we see many , many gigabytes of the digital photos of digital photographs that can nahtlos and fortwährend , schwenken , in a way , kann in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one here is a scan from the kongressbibliothek , and it &apos;s in a range of 300 megapixeln .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that the performance of a system can be like this is the number of pixel in your screen at any moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of nichtbild-daten .
this is bleak house of dickens . each column is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really a text , and not a picture of a picture , we can do something like that , to really show that this is a real representation and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a e-buch .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a realistischerer case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a abschnitts .
and that gives you really the pleasure and the good experience of a magazine or a magazine or a newspaper to read , which is a kind of medium .
we also have done something on the corner of this particular issue of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a false display with very high resolution that is much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specs .
and this is really greift these ideas for the available place on the screen .
we hope that it doesn &apos;t mean pop-ups and other nonsense -- it should not be necessary .
of course , this mapping is one of the most obvious things for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t really want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re going to be contributing to this area .
but these are all the streets in the united states .
übereinandergelagert oben at the top picture of nasa .
now let &apos;s get something different .
this is actually live on the internet . you can nachprüfen it .
this is a project called photosynth , which connects to two different technologies together .
one is seadragon , and the other is a very good research on computervision , which is from noah snavely , a universitätsstudenten of the university washington , under the counseling of steve seitz at the uw
and rick szeliski from microsoft &apos;s research was done , a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by seadragon .
you can see that if we can create these kinds of views where we can go through images and have this experience of mehrfachen resolution .
but the spatial anordnung of the imagery is actually meaning .
the computervision-algorithmen have made these pictures together by putting them together in the real space that they all have near the grassi lakes in the canadian rockies of rockies in , and you see , you see , there are elements of stabilisierten slides , and these things were all given in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ve got time to show you other environments .
there &apos;s a lot of räumlicher .
i would like to show one of the originalen datensätze of noah , and that &apos;s from a early prototype of noah to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology , which is photosynth-technologie , and this is not necessarily so obvious when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
this is a rekonstruktion of the cathedral notre lady , just dropped in the computer with images of flickr , and they will get pictures of men in t-shirts and so on . each one of this orange orange , represents a picture that was discovered as this model .
so this is all flickr-bilder , and they &apos;re all in the way in relation to each other .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i was going to work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception .
i guess you can see that this is a lot of different types of cameras : everything is , from the handy-kamera to professional slrs , a pretty large number of you all have been in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird .
many of them are verdeckt on faces , etc .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here you are .
this is actually a poster by notre dame , which was right recorded .
we can shift from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment . it &apos;s now collected from all the data -- from all the collective memory of this , like , visual earth -- and everything is connected .
all these photographs are connected to each other , and it creates something larger than the sum of parts .
they get a model that comes out of all the earth .
think of this as the sequel of the work of stephen lawlers on virtual earth .
and this is something that goes through the complexity that people use it , grows and use it to be bigger for the user .
their own photos are going to be beschildert with metadaten that one other person has entered .
if someone has done the trouble and tells them who they are , and i can use them as a point of starting to dive into this room , to dive into these areas that are using photos from other people , and create a kind of übergreifender social experience using other people &apos;s experience .
and of course , byproduct of all these are immense rich models of virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that didn &apos;t only get through überflüge or satellite images and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
i get it right . do i understand it right ? their software , within the next few years , within the next few years , all the images , in the world , will be used in principle ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t make anything else .
if you want to put it hyperlinks between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting , if you think about the abundance of information that many of these images have .
as you do a websuche for pictures , where you enter sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about it , which is a picture .
but what if the picture is associated with all your pictures ?
then the scope of semantischen querverbindung and the abundance that makes it up , really , enormously . it &apos;s a classic classic .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some of my book from my book , as i &apos;m hoping , in unison with other things you &apos;ve heard already , and i &apos;m going to try to make myself some connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official dogma . &quot;
the official dogma of what ?
the official glaubenssatz of all the western industrialized societies .
so the official dogma works so : if our goal to maximize the good citizens of our citizens , it &apos;s all about the freedom of the individual &apos;s freedom .
the reason for this is that freedom in itself is good , valuable , meaningful , meaningful premise for human .
when people have freedom , each of us is all about to do the things that maximize our public good , and no one has to choose for us .
maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more good news they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , that no way it would come to mind .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what enables us to modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say something about salatdressing .
there is 175 dressings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t mitzählen the 10 extra extra extra extra extra extra and 12 balsamico-essig that you could buy a huge number of your lettuce , the unlikely unlikely case , that none of the 175 in the store for it is right .
so this is like the supermarket .
and then they go to the verbraucher-elektronik business for a stereo -- speaker , cd-player , a kassetten-player , verstärker , verstärker , and in that one electronics there &apos;s so many stereo facilities .
we can put together 6.5 million different stereo facilities in the components that are offered a business .
you have to admit that &apos;s a big choice .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , when i was able to get a boy , you could have anbieter bell .
they rented her phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence that was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we have almost an infinite choice of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- mp3-player- , mp3-player- , nasen-haar-trimmer und fackel fackel .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that in your business , you can be sure that you &apos;re going to be safe .
and what it does is it makes people walk in business and ask that question .
now , you know what the answer to that question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are very much more bedeutsamer than you can buy objects , the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that she &apos;s going to go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they &apos;re going to tell them , and the doctor says we could make a do or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and you say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ? ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
and this is -- we call it a good thing , but it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , the doctor -- to someone who knows nothing , and most likely to be ill , and therefore , in the best constitution , is not a decision to meet the patient .
there are immense marketing for verschreibungspflichtige drugs for people like it , and me , if you think about it , no sense of any sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they advertise , if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : you &apos;re expecting to call the doctor the next morning and ask a change of the prescription .
something as much as tiefgreifendes as our identity is now a question of how to show this slide .
we don &apos;t have identity ; we invent it .
and we &apos;re very often redefining ourselves as we want to .
that means that every day when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard-annahme was , that almost everybody had one , and they were able to heirateten as fast as they could , and then we could get kids as fast as they could .
the only real choice was , &quot; who , &quot; not when , not what they did .
today , everything is easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less careful .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry ?
should i get married later ? should i have children , or do i want to do it ? &quot;
these are all einnehmende questions .
and you &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether it means that all of the tasks i get you to do , i &apos;m not going to get a good grade in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to beantwortende questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl verdeutlicht , with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every single minute of every single minute to work on the planet .
and by the way , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you to do .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice we have to make on work in terms of work , again and again , whether we should be working or not to work .
we can see our kids watching football , and we have our cell phone to the one hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop probably in our lap .
and also , even though they &apos;re removed , every minute , every minute in the verstümmeln of our child verstümmeln , we also ask ourselves , &quot; should i think this call this call ? &quot;
should i answer this email answers ? should i write that letter ? &quot;
and also , as the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s not going to be your child &apos;s experience , very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle life is a question of choice .
and the world we lived in the world was like this .
and i want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world we &apos;re living in now is this .
and the question is , is the good or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
an effect , paradoxer wise , is that he lähmt lähmt .
so with so many options you can choose , it &apos;s very hard to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another drastisches example , a study about investment in volunteers .
one colleague of mine had access to investitions-akten from vanguard , the giant fondgesellschaft of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 investmentfonds who anbot the employers , took over two percent .
they offer 50 investmentfonds -- 10 percent less employees than if they only offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investmentfonds who are on choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide which you want to pick it in tomorrow .
and then the morning , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , you never come .
you know , that &apos;s not just what people eat food food if they &apos;re going to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to travel , it also means making decisions so hard that they miss large investitionsangebote of their employer .
by which they don &apos;t participation , they spend up to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year from the arbeitsgeber who have been happy to reproduce their contributions .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes sense that the world looks like this .
you want to make the decision right , if it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to fund the false investment , or even the wrong investment .
so this is a effect . the other effect is that even if we &apos;ve been transcending the paralysis and a decision to end , we end up with less content with the result of choice , when we had the opportunity to decide with less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is not perfect -- and it &apos;s not perfect -- and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what &apos;s happening is that they can have a different choice , and what &apos;s happening is that they make the decision that they make a decision , and that may seem negative as negative satisfaction on the happiness that they did , even if it was a good decision .
the more possibilities that there is , the more simple it is , it &apos;s nothing to regret that is disappointing to the choice they meet .
secondly , what economists call oppertunitätskosten .
dan gilbert did make a big deal with this morning by telling how much the way we rate things on what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to think about , it &apos;s just as easy to think of alternatives to imagine that they &apos;re willing to be less satisfied with the alternatives they &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a few in the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . they have everything for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; damn , &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my manhattener neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly in front of my house . &quot;
and he &apos;s spending two weeks of the thought that he &apos;s got missed to have missed the possibility of having missed a great parking lot day .
oppertunitätskosten kills the happiness that we get through our choice , even if what we chose is fantastic .
and the more choices that there are more attractive properties , the more attractive properties of this choice .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon makes some statements .
he makes a statement about it now , and maybe things start to do things slowly .
but one more important thing that he &apos;s doing is , always who you choose to do for one thing , you don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things like many attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to do what they &apos;re going to do less attractive .
third : eskalation of expectations .
this struck me when i was talking about my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in that there was just jeans of a species , and they bought them , and they &apos;ve got bad , and they were incredibly unkomfortabel , and they had washed them long enough , and they didn &apos;t have washed up enough , they started out &quot; ok &quot; ok .
so , i went to a new jeans after a lot of years of the tragens of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans . &quot;
and the guy said , &quot; do you want to schlanke , easily anliegende or weite ?
do you washed up buttons or reißverschluss ? stone or acid ?
do you want to get jeans with holes ?
you want to cut down far , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way that it used to be . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour of all this damn jeans , and it gets the business -- and i get the truth -- with the best performing jeans i ever had .
i had better . all of these choices allowed me to do better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it myself .
the reason that i was feeling worse with all these resources , with all these opportunities , my expectations of what good for a good few jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have any concrete expectations when they were in a way .
when you came in 100 species , damn , one of them should be perfect .
and what i got good was , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i was expecting to have , and what i had had was a enttäuschend compared to what i expected .
adding possibility of possibilities in the life of people , inevitably , are inevitably the people who are going to be these possibilities .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
no one in the world in the world knows this , because if you would , you wouldn &apos;t know what it &apos;s going on .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that used to be better than anything that was worse than anything was worse than anything was worse than anything that was a pleasant surprise to people who were a comfortable surprise .
today , in the world we live in -- we &apos;re wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as an expectation -- the best thing you can ever hope for is as well as you expect it .
they &apos;re never going to make pleasant überrascht. because their expectations , my expectations , are haushoch .
the secret to glücklichkeit -- that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all had -- the secret to glücklichkeit are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short autobiographischer moment -- that i &apos;m married to a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i don &apos;t have niedergelassen .
but niederlassen isn &apos;t always such a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of a kaufens sitzenden , when there are just a way to buy a way to say , and you wonder why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what would you have to do ?
if hundreds of different types of jeans are available , and you buy one that &apos;s disappointing , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also as clear that the answer is the question : you .
you could have done it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the schaufenster , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions , and even though the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it , they &apos;re blaming themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the last generation in the last generation .
i believe in a signifikanter -- not the only one , but a signifikanter beiträger to this explosion of depression , is that people have been so disappointing because their standards are so high , and then , if you have to explain these experiences , think it would be your fault .
and so the bilanzergebnis is that we &apos;re going to do better , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remember you .
this is the official dogma that we &apos;re all right , it &apos;s completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that is better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow that is better than a little bit better than a little choice .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we missed this point for a long time that we missed our public health .
now , as an grundsatz question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as an argument , as an argument about thinking about thinking about thinking about it , what &apos;s all this choice in the industrialized societies , that material is wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of them whose problem is not too big .
your problem is they have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and annoying is steve levitt has told you yesterday about how much more expensive and hard to installierenden car seats don &apos;t , it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i tell you is that these expensive , these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help .
they even hurt .
they worry about that to be worse .
if something of what the people of our society enables us to make decisions as much more choices into the societies , not only would the lives of people improve , it would be improved .
economists call this a pareto-verbesserungs application .
einkommensumverteilung will worry about it all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big selection are plagt us .
finally , reading this cartoon , and it &apos;s an incredible thing to say , &quot; ah , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ? &quot;
you don &apos;t know anything in this goldfischglas . &quot;
verarmten fantasy , a kurzsichtige view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i thought i thought that fish was something white .
because the truth is , if you break the goldfischglas , that everything is possible , you have no freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the goldfischglas , so that all is possible , lower your happiness happiness .
they increase paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a goldfischglas .
this is almost limited to limited security -- possibly the fish , definitely for us .
but the abhanden of a metaphor is a recipe for misery , and i guess disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects before the human genome and what this might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we have digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code in a new phase of biology by building new lives .
we always have tried to ask great questions .
what life is ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have tried to understand and do it on different levels .
we tried different approaches to simplify it to the precise components .
we &apos;ve digitized virtually 20 years , and when we &apos;ve sequenced , we &apos;ve sequenced the change from the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now , we &apos;re trying to wonder whether we can regenerate , or can we create new life from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma geitalium , who has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve been trying to do this with smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it to about a hundred genes to get rid of the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , in comparison to me , it is simple . but if we look at all of these genes that genes we can eliminate one after one of the other , it &apos;s very unlikely that it would lead to a living cell .
so , we decided that it &apos;s the only way to synthesize this chromosome is what allows us to vary the individual components and provide some of these fundamental questions .
so we started with the question , can we synthesize an chromosome ?
does it allow the chemistry to make these really big molecules that hasn &apos;t been done before ?
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
one chromosome is just a piece of inertes chemical material .
our steps at the digitalisierung were exponentially .
now , our ability to write genetic code very slowly , but it &apos;s increased to a exponential curve now .
we started with this 15 years ago .
it was actually a few years from a bioethischen review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out that it turns out to be very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world to make little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a degenerativer process , and the longer you do a piece , the more mistakes that happen .
so we had to develop a new way to build these pieces with these little pieces of pieces and make mistakes .
this was the first attempt , starting with the digital information , from the genome phi phi .
it &apos;s a small virus of bacteria .
we made small pieces , and we made a fehlerkorrektur molecule , and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting stage came when we took this piece of inerte chemical and we put into a bacterium , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code and made viral particles .
then the viral particles were opened by the cells , and came back and killed e. .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said that they were able to figure out this model .
they laughed more than you here .
so , we think that this is a situation in the software that actually can build its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go further . we wanted to build a whole bakterielles chromosome . it &apos;s got to us , we thought we &apos;re building it in kassetten the size of the virus that we can vary the size of the kassetten to understand what the individual components are of living .
design is the key , and if you &apos;re going to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information must be really accurate .
when we sequenced the genome in 1995 , the fehlerrate was a mistake of a mistake per 10,000 base .
we found the resequenzieren of 30 mistakes , and if we used the original sequence , it would never be possible .
part of the design is to make pieces that are just 50 letters for 50 letters to other sorts of pieces of things to put smaller pieces together to build smaller sub-einheiten so that they fit together .
we have unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have waterzeichen installed .
think about it : we have a 4-buchstaben code : a , c , g and t.
triplets of these letters -- this letters is about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
initially , we only have signed up .
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry .
we &apos;ve so designed the pieces that we could easily break them with enzymes , and there are enzymes that bring them to fix them .
and we have started making pieces , starting with pieces of five to siebentausend letters , would put these together each other together to try to put this back together to 72.000 .
in each step , we &apos;ve made these pieces in the surplus , so we were producing them , because we tried to create a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
so this looks like a basketball-playoff .
if we get to these really big pieces -- with over 100,000 pairs -- they &apos;re not just going to grow up in e. , and it goes to all the ways of modern molecular biology , and so we used to other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of homologe rekombination , which is using biology to repair dna that can merge these pieces .
here &apos;s an example of that . there &apos;s an organism called deinococcus radiodurans of the three million rads of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome just falls apart .
12 or 24 hours later , everything has been put together as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely dried , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely certain that life can exist in space and move , looking for aquatischen conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
so this is a gefügeaufnahme of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve only used to have hefe-mechanismen hefe-mechanismen with the right design of the pieces , we &apos;ve been using it . yeast doesn &apos;t put it automatically .
this is not a elektronenmikroskopaufnahme elektronenmikroskopaufnahme . it &apos;s a reguläre mikroskopaufnahme .
it &apos;s so big molecule that we can even see it with the lichtmikroskop .
these are footage about six seconds of six seconds .
that &apos;s the publication we &apos;ve only done recently done .
this is over 580.000 code code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule that has ever been created by people .
it has a molekulargewicht of over 300 million .
if we print it with a schriftgröße of 10 and without the distances , it would correspond to 142 pages , just about this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s a virus that &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s just easier to be able to do it as we &apos;re doing it : you just take the nucleus out , and you get a different in it , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about cloning .
in archaebakterien , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but just recently , we &apos;ve shown that you can do a full bacterial chromosome from one cell to another , and it can activate it .
and we gave a little bit of extra-gene to put this chromosome , grob , in grob , as humans said , to destroy all the proteins , and it was quite amazing when we put it in a cell -- and they &apos;ll appreciate our very ausgereiften graphs .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we &apos;re trying to get a little further .
this is the evolution of evolution here .
we &apos;re finding all kinds of species here , or a third of irgendwoher , each time , thousands of characteristics in just a second to a species per second .
so people who think of evolution as a gene has been changed at a time , a lot of biology has missed .
there are enzymes that are called enzymes the restriktionsenzyme that are actually called dna .
the chromosome in the cell has no one ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve put together .
it turned out in the cell and realized the other chromosome as foreign materials , and so we had one cell at the end with a new chromosome .
it was blue because of the genes that we had put together .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species and konvertierte into a new species based on the new software that we have in the cell .
all the proteins changed , they changed -- when we read the genetic code , it changed exactly what we &apos;re swimming .
it may sound like genomic alchimie , but we can by cutting the software-dna things quite dramatic .
now , i argued that &apos;s not the genesis -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argued that we might be able to create a new form of the cambrian explosion where there might be a massive new artenbildung based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious to what we need .
we &apos;ve been anzuwachsen to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people today on this planet has been there for anyone in 1946 to this planet , within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh water , clean water , medicine , fuel for 6,5 billion people .
it becomes a challenge to nine .
we need to take over five billion tons of coal , 30-plus billion gallons of oil . these are a hundred million fässer .
if we think about biological processes , or we think about it , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all this co2 from this material that lands in the atmosphere .
we &apos;ve now got out of our discoveries from around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the designkomponenten of the future .
the elektronikindustrie had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
we &apos;re in the first line of the biological reality of biological reality , and to those of us .
we today have technologies because of these fast synthesemethoden , to do what we call kombinatorische genetics .
now we have the opportunity to build a large robot to build millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine these 20 million different kinds of different kinds of genes , or creating these processes to optimize drugs , or drugs new vaccines , we can change just more molecular biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s only nurmale selection . we can selektieren selektieren selektieren , production of chemicals or treibstoffproduktion and so on .
this is a shot of actually design-software that we &apos;re working on where you actually sit down and you &apos;re designing new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it looks like . we know exactly how their genetic code is going to look .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation of the fourth generation .
you have seen ethanol recently , which is just a bad experiment .
we have fuel of the zweiten- and third generation that are relatively soon coming out , and the other generation of butanol or different kinds of butanol .
but , as we think , the only way of biology is a huge impact on the cost of food or the limitation of their availability , if we see co2 as a source material , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that go on that path .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first of the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have different kinds of different methods .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about ein-einhalb miles deep , almost kochenden wassertemperaturen .
it converts carbon dioxide into methane using hydrogen than the energy source .
we study whether we can use carbon footprint , which could just be brought to produktionsplätzen , konvertieren the co2 in order to drive this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- moderate goals like ersatz of the entire petrochemischen industry , right . if you could not do that at ted , where else ? a hauptquelle of energy .
but in the same way we &apos;re working right now to use these kinds of vaccines to develop vaccines .
you saw it this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year on the back , and we have a dollar to get the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by creating rekombinante vaccines in the vorhinein .
this is what the future might possibly look like with changes with changes , today , can accelerate with synthetic bacteria , archaen , and potentially eukaryonten .
we are entfernt light years away from people , and our goal is that we have an opportunity for long enough to survive enough to do that . thank you very much .
at the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s as far as it was . and those who were not there at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever addressed -- 27 miles across the diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a milliardstel second in the beginning of the universe -- and to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take pictures of these mini-urknalle in detectors .
i work on that . it &apos;s called an atlas detector -- 44 feet in the diameter , 22 feet in diameter .
this is a spectacular picture of atlas in the construction that you see the scale .
on september 10 last year , the machine went to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it caused huge jubel in the control room .
it &apos;s an image of the first strahlenpartikels , which all the rest of the lhc , then absichtlich with a part of the lhc , to make an area of particles in order to make particles out of particles .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10 , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if it created the biggest jubel , or this , when someone went to the google side and went to the front page .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific impact .
about one week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with this wires here -- these golden wires here .
these wires leiten ampere when the machine is running on hochleistung .
now , the engineers among you , you &apos;ll look at them and say , &quot; no , you don &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you go down very far cold , you will be called supraleitern .
so in minus 271 degrees , cooler than the space between stars , can be able to withstand wires .
in one of the connections , between over neuntausend magnets at the lhc , there was a manufakturdefekt .
so the wires actually heat apart and 13-tausend ampere ampere .
this was the result .
now , this is still wonderful when you think that the magnets weigh 20 tons and shifted about 30 centimeters .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnet we damaged about 50 .
and they had to remove what we did .
we konditionierten them , reparierten them .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
at the end of march , the lhc will be funktionsfähig again .
we &apos;re going to turn it up , and expect it to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the data on june , and see what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a kind of spark of accidents like this accidents , again , the value of science and ingenieurskunst at the borders , it &apos;s easy to reject that .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our borders , form the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave the words of the words of his lehrlings , his apprentice was michael faraday , who said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind , as to assume that our scientific ideas are obvious that there are no mystery in nature that our triumphe are vollzählig , and that there are no new worlds . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but of course , it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s my great , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change .
but the recent part of my life , and my career , has led me to rethink my relationship with this work .
this strange event was that i recently wrote a book -- a biography called „ eat , pray , love “ -- that , decided , in other words , unlike all my previous books went out of the world , and was a big mega-ereignis , international bestseller-ding .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated , as if i would be treated .
seriously , dem geweiht !
for example , they get very concerned about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that success ? &quot;
don &apos;t they worry about their whole life , and never create a book again , anyone in the world in the world ? never again ?
okay , the power really courage .
but it wouldn &apos;t be worse if i &apos;m not going to remember that over 20 years ago , when i was a teenager , when i was a teenager , i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of angstbesetzter response .
people said , did you have no fear to succeed ?
don &apos;t you worry that the humiliation kill the humiliation kill ?
don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re going to nachgehst your life for your life , and you never come out of it and you &apos;re going to be able to die on a schrotthaufen geplatzter dreams -- your mouth filled with bitter versagens the failure of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : „ ja .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i &apos;ve always had .
and i &apos;m afraid of a lot more things that nobody would know .
as algae -- and other furchteinflößende things .
but , when i think about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it recently and question : why ? why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that somebody should be expected to do the work that he feels to do ?
and what &apos;s happening with the creative technology is that you &apos;re going to make us insecure about the mental mind -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in 40 years as a chemist when he was asked to be a chemist .
with your chemiker-blockade , john -- how about you ?
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists didn &apos;t get the call by alkoholsüchtigen manisch-depressive people .
we seem to have writers , but it &apos;s not only the writers , but not only the writers , but the creative of all genres , seem to have this reputation seem mentally incredibly unstable .
all you need to do is to look at the bitter todeszahlen of really great minds from the 20th century alone that died young and a lot of their own hand .
and even those who are not actually committed to begingen , seemed to be really neglected from their talents .
norman mailer : shortly before he died his death in his last interview , every one of my books has killed me a little bit .
a extraordinary statement that you can do about your work work .
but we don &apos;t even be able to hear someone , because we &apos;ve been familiar with somebody as a very long time , somehow , we &apos;ve seen the perception and collectively accepted that creativity and suffering , of course , of course , of course , that art -- in the end -- always führt .
the question i want to ask everyone here is : is this idea for you all right ?
if you might feel about that ? because with only one centimeter , i don &apos;t feel myself with this idea at all .
i find them really .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see how she &apos;s going to the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we are encouraging our great creative to live .
and i definitely know that it was -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to begin to start , this dark path of the presumption sort of herunterzusickern -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career in my career .
that means -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 arbeitsjahre in myself .
and it &apos;s extremely likely to be that everything i &apos;m going to write from the world as the work , after the work , the success of my last book , was right , right ?
i &apos;m saying it , because we &apos;re all right now , in some kind of friends -- it &apos;s extremely likely that my biggest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that can get somebody to do the morning at 9 o &apos;clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want that .
i would prefer to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
and after some time , after some time , i feel that i think i can write , i think , to write a kind of construct psychological construction .
and somehow , i have to find a way of writing a safe distance in writing a safe distance between me and very natural beklemmung about how the writing reaction is going to be .
so in the past year , i &apos;ve been looking for models for this past year , and i tried to find other societies whether they might be able to see whether they might have better ideas about this as we can help to deal with the emotional risks that are connected to creativity .
this quest to find me in the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me because the circle will end again .
but in the old greece and rome in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of göttlicher diener-geist , which is from a distant , unknown source to the people -- from unerklärlichen , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this divine diener-geister of creativity in creativity .
by socrates , he knows that he would have thought he would have a dämon , him from further distant .
the roman had the same idea , called the same kind of körperlosem creative mind a „ genius .
that &apos;s great . the roman didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius was a kind of genius that was found that it was literally living in the walls of a künstlerateliers -- sort of like dobby , the hauself -- the rauskäme and the artists in the work would be invisible to the outcome of the work .
that &apos;s brilliant -- there &apos;s a distance that i &apos;ve been talking about -- the psychological construct that protect you from your work .
and everyone knew that it worked , right ?
the artist &apos;s artist &apos;s performers was protected to certain things like , for example , too much narzissmus , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew that you had this körperlose genius that helped you .
if your work floppte -- not entirely your fault , right ?
everybody knew your genius was paralyzed .
so people in the west really thought about creativity for a long time .
and then the renaissance , and it was all changed . we had this great idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human center in the center of the universe -- about all gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no room for mystic creatures that take orders of the divine .
it &apos;s the beginning of the rational humanism and people started to think that creativity completely came from its own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people that , or for those artists , they call this a genius -- instead of that he has a genius .
i have to tell you : i think that was a big mistake .
you know , i think a mere person to allow you to think about it , or the essence , like the basin and the essence and the source of all the divine , creative , unbekanntem , infinite mysteriums is a little bit of responsibility to be a lot of responsibility to a fragilen , human psyche .
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
the entstellt and distorted sense , and it creates all of these unerreichbaren expectations of success .
i think this erfolgs-druck has destroyed our artists for the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ? ?
perhaps too ancient understanding about the relationship between people and mystery of the creative .
maybe not .
maybe we don &apos;t just rationalen for 500 years of not just rationalen in a 18-minütigen talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience that really berechtigte scientific doubts about the notion of -- basically -- feen , the people nachfolgen and feenzauber on their projects and so on .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on that journey .
but the question i want to address is : why not ?
why not think about it ?
because it makes a lot of sense like everything else i &apos;ve heard , when it was about explaining the absolute crazy process of the creative process .
a process that &apos;s -- as everyone who knows that it has ever tried to do something -- in other words , in other words , everyone here -- is not always reasonable .
in fact , he can feel pretty paranormal .
i had a very extraordinary encounter recently , which was now 90 american poet , but she told me that she was growing up in the fields out in virginia outside the fields , was growing up in the fields , and she said she was feeling and hear it as a poem about the landscape on them .
she said it would be a donnernder train .
it would be würde on the land .
she felt when it came , because it would get the earth under your feet .
she knew she could just do one such a moment , and that was -- in their words -- „ running like the devil “ .
she ran like the devil to run as she &apos;s been tracked by this poem , and it didn &apos;t have to get fast enough to a piece of paper and a pencil , so that you had to capture it , capture and capture it could capture and capture on the sheet .
it wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and rolled up , and she would roll it up , and she missed it . she &apos;d say it . she said it would move on the country , and as she said , as she said -- „ after another poet .
and then there were these moments -- i will never forget -- i &apos;ll never forget -- she said that moments gave it almost missed it .
so , she runs out to the house and addiction to the paper and the poem goes through her , and she grabs a pencil , and she picks up a pen , just as it hindurchgeht through them , and then she said -- it was as if they would reach their other hand and grab it .
they caught the poem on his tail , and they moved it back in their body and took it on the sheet of paper .
in those opportunities , the poem was running and intact on paper -- but backwards -- the last word for the first one .
when i heard that , i thought that it &apos;s creepy -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going .
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a maultier . to work to work to work at the same time and sweat every day , and sweat , abmühen me and schwitzen me .
but even in my maultierart , i have this thing .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
i had some work , or ideas that i can &apos;t identify from a source through me .
what is this a thing ? ?
and how do we work with it without losing our minds , but in the contrary to intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example of me is the best living example of how you can create the musician tom waits . i was allowed to interview him a few years ago .
we were talking about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life was the embodiment of the gepeinigten modern artist &apos;s embodiment , trying to master and get to deal with them and deal with them .
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that he was going to go to a schnellstraße schnellstraße in los angeles , and it changed everything for him .
and he was driving a little fragment of a melody , which , as it &apos;s a lot of inspiration , is it &apos;s quälend for him , and he wants to do it . she &apos;s prachtvoll , and he &apos;s lechzt , but he can &apos;t believe it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he &apos;s got no pen , he doesn &apos;t have a kassettenrekorder .
so he starts to get up these old beklemmung in it , like , like , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be tracked by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it .
but instead of diving in panic , it just stopped .
he finished all the time and did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky , and he said , &quot; excuse me , can &apos;t you see i drive a car ? &quot;
„ , i can look like i could just write a song ? ? &quot;
if you really want to exist , come back to a günstigeren moment when i can take care of you .
if not , someone else today .
go und leonard cohen cohen .
his whole whole arbeitsprozess has changed afterwards .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as ever and ever .
but the process and the heavy beklemmung that surrounds him was aufgehoben when he was das , where he did nothing as a anger , and he had a zurückließ where he had come from . he realized that it had not had a verinnerlichtes thing .
it could give a eigentümliche , wondrous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and fremdartigen , pure thing that was not quite tom .
when i heard this story also a little bit of the way i worked , and i &apos;ve been saved .
and i saved this when i was in the middle of the schreibprozess of „ eat , pray , pray , and i fell into one of these gruben of the zweifels , when we &apos;re going to do something , and it doesn &apos;t work . you start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster . this is the worst book ever written .
not only bad , but the worst of all time .
i started to think , i should just do the project .
but then i remembered how tom had spoken to the free sky , and i tried to .
so i took up my view of the manuscript , and i was talking about an empty corner of the room .
i talked out loud : listen , you , you , you and i know , you , if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely brilliant that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see , i mean , you know , i &apos;ve invested , invest . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to get it better , you &apos;ve got to show up here and follow your percentage of deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what the hell do .
i &apos;m going to write still , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give up to protokoll that i was here today for my part of the jobs that was here .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s going to be like this . centuries ago , you &apos;ve got to mondscheinfesten people &apos;s dances with holy dances with holy dances and music that were versammelt for hours -- until dawn .
those were always great , because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but once again , very rare , something happened , one of the performers was actually wurde .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all had seen such a performance in your life .
it was like the time stillstehen , and the dancers through a kind of pforte , and he did nothing else when he ever did it before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything added .
and all of a sudden , he has no longer menschlich .
it was lit from the inside and down from the bottom , and everything erhellte through a göttliches fire .
as something then happened , people knew what that was . they called it at his name .
they put hands together and started singing : „ allah , allah , god , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
the interesting historic fußnote , as the mohren südspanien eroberten , as the mohren südspanien , they took this . the pronunciation changed over the course of the centuries of „ allah , allah , allah “ zu , olé , olé “ , that you can still hear about stierkämpfen and flamenco-tänzen .
if a performers in spain was forced to do something magical : „ allah , olé , olé , allah , allah , great “ , you know , there &apos;s a flüchtiger look at god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but , the tricky part , the next morning when the dancer himself wakes up himself and realized that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and it &apos;s no longer a fünkchen of god in her .
it &apos;s just a alternder sterblicher with schmerzenden , and maybe he &apos;s never going to go up to those höhen .
and maybe somebody never gets to tell god god &apos;s name , but what &apos;s he going to do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the schmerzhaftesten korrekturen of a creative life .
but perhaps it doesn &apos;t have to be that full of pein if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence came from you .
if you just believe that you &apos;re a loan -- from a unvorstellbaren source of your life , your life that you &apos;re being passed on somebody else when you &apos;re ready to do it .
when we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so , i started thinking , and i think of security in the past months , while i was working on the book that i worked soon -- when the dangerous thing is the dangerous , frightening , really , really , a great successor successor to my success .
what i have to say to myself is when i &apos;m crazy , i &apos;m not scared .
don &apos;t be entmutigt .
just do your job .
be on your contribution , whatever it might be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the stupid divine genius that is asked you to be a moment , for a moment , for a moment , for a short moment to show a moment of wonder , olé olé !
and if not , dance , still dance .
and „ olé ! “ for you despite all this .
and i think about it , and i feel that we should teach it .
„ olé ! “ , for you in spite of all of this , just for you to be the mere human love and the eigensinn for you to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
olé !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic eiskappe , which was for nearly three million years of the size of the lower 48 states , has declined 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t press very much the seriousness of this particular problem because it &apos;s not the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic eiskappe is the schlagende heart of our global klimasystems .
it grows in the winter and schrumpft in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a zeitrafferaufnahme what happened over the last 25 years .
the dauereis is labeled red .
as you can see , it grows on the dunkelblau . this is the annual ice of the winter ; it &apos;s schrumpft in summer .
the so-called dauereis , five years old , or older , is almost like blood , which is out of the body here .
in 25 years , it will be gone from here .
this is a problem , because warming up the ocean , warming around the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s large amounts of carbon dioxide , which is where it &apos;s been implemented by microbes being implemented by microbes .
compared to the whole amount of klimaverändernden tissue in the atmosphere , it could double that amount if we cross this critical point .
already today sprudelt , in some flat lakes in alaska , methane from the water .
professor katey walter &apos;s university in alaska was traveling with another flat sea in the past winter .
wow ! ! !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how will it ergehen us .
and one reason is , this enormous heat heat aus greenland .
this is a jährlicher tauwasserfluss .
but the volume are far bigger than ever before .
this is the kangerlussuaq river in the southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the level of sea level goes up to the ocean here .
these rivers take very rapidly .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest eismasse on the planet .
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent has been now a negative eisbilanz .
and the westantarktis that showed up over a few unterwasserinseln is particularly strong .
this is equivalent to 20 feet , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the drittgrössten eismasse , you see new lakes in the top of a few years ago .
40 percent of all people in the world are getting half their trinkwassers from this schmelzwasser .
in the andes , this glacier is the trinkwasserquelle for this city .
the wassermengen have been expanding .
but when you versiegen , most drinking most drinking water .
in california , a 40 percent reduction reduction in the sierra year .
this is betrifft .
and the predictions that they &apos;ve read them are serious .
these austrocknung in all over the world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters around the world have never increased an unprecedented degree .
four times over the last 30 years , like in vorhergegangenen 75. .
this is an entirely unhaltbares entwicklungsmuster .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it anrichtet .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 , all 24 hours -- 25 million tons of the day into the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific right in the ocean , from the american continent , western and beiderseits of the indian subkontinents , where there &apos;s a radical decline of the oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most common problem .
the united states is one of the largest verschmutzer , together with china .
and the proposal was to build many more kohlefabriken .
but we start to see change .
here are the ones that have taken off the last few years with some green alternatives that were proposed .
there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the kohleindustrien and ölindustrien have spent a viertelmilliarde dollar on kalendarjahr dollars in order to apply to clean coal , which is a contradiction .
this picture reminded me of something .
around christmas , in my home at home , in my home in tennessee , a billion tons of kohleschlamm .
you saw it warscheinlich in the news .
this is in our entire country of zweitgrösste american abfallfluss america .
this happened about christmas .
one of the commercials &apos;s commercials by christmas was this one .
frosty is a vergnügter , happy boy .
it gives it in shell and abundance in america , and it helps our economy to grow .
frosty , the kohlenmann will be cleaner every day .
it &apos;s affordable and liebenswert , and workers remain lohn and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful bergarbeiter is the head of massey coal .
so let me tell you an entirely clear . al gore , nancy pelosi , you know , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection has started to live .
this is one , part of her .
in the coalergy , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
so we set out to the top of the top zeil , to spend a significant geldsumme , to spend a major geldsumme to get to the truth to the truth .
the fact is coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and smells too well .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let &apos;s leave that quiet .
saueber coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean kohlefabrik .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean kohletechnologie .
and yet , the burning of coal , and yet , the burning of one of the main reasons for global warming , is the remarkable clean kohletechnologie that you see here , changes everything .
look at it , this is right now , clean kohletechnologie .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that connects all these together is our dependence on kohlenstoff-basierenden fuels like dirty coal and ausländisches oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us from that misslichen .
versorge america with 100 percent clean electricity in the next 10 years , within the next 10 years .
a plan to get america back to work is to make us safer and help to stop global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
versorge america neu . find more out .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a neuversorgung of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on ancient , dirty fuels that ersticken our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create gut jobs .
versorge america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
we need to get far , quickly .
thank you .
i want to start with that to ask you when you were playing your childhood in your childhood .
while you realized how to reach your hands and zugreift the klötze and moves the klötze and moves , and actually , to be able to understand how to understand and understand how to understand and change .
spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand most of our environment .
so , wundern kalanithi , i started wondering : what if we were to be wondering : what if we were a computer scientist - , as a computer scientist , which is moving into a flat arbeitsfläche -- which if we could intervene with both hands and intervene to physically take data and organize data on the data and assemble data , how we want to do it ?
the question was so moving to the answer to the answer the answer the answer and developed siftables .
in short , a siftable is a interactive computer the size of a kekses .
you can move with your hand , you can see each other , you can capture your movements , and you can have a screen and you have a screen .
more important : are physically , so you can just reach them through the hands of hands and access .
and the siftables is an example of a new generation of a new generation of digital data .
and if these tools are going to become physical , and awareness of their movements and develop awareness of each other , and see the intricacies of our umgangs with them , then , we can begin to explore new and more entertaining information .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
this siftable is for videowiedergabe konfiguriert , and when i put it in a direction , it &apos;s going to play video forward ; when i kippe it in the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits are taking each other &apos;s true .
so when i put them side-by-side , they &apos;re interested in their interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded , you &apos;ll notice that , too , and you can get a little nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and propensity .
an interesting set of interactions of the interactions that we started to realize was that we could use ordinary gestures on data , like the colors of colors like you do this with the fluid .
in this case , we have three siftables as a farbtöpfe konfiguriert , and i can use them to cast color in the middle , where they &apos;re then mixed together .
so if we can overdo it &apos;s a little bit of zurückschütten .
there are also some nice opportunities in education as well as languages , math , or logikspiele , where we give people the opportunity to take the possibility of fast trial and see the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a series of fibonacci series i &apos;m making with a simple gleichungsprogramm .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle .
and basically , every time you get zugewiesene , you know , and you &apos;re trying to form words of words , and you &apos;re going to get words , you &apos;re going to get this over a dictionary .
then after about 30 seconds , again , again , again , you have a new buchstabenkombination and new opportunity .
thank you .
these are some kids who came to the media lab , and i could move them to try it to try and take a video .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here are some people who are testing it .
that &apos;s our youngest beta-tester down there on the right .
it turns out that he just wanted to stack up the siftables .
so for him , they were just bauklötze .
this is an interactive trickfilmanwendung .
we wanted to develop a lernmittel for sprachlerner .
that &apos;s felix .
he can bring new characters into the scene by aufhebt the siftable of the table that shows this character .
this is the sun population .
the sun goes on to go .
now he gets a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes ! yes !
by shaking the siftables , and he can put the characters together ...
... his own story .
hello ! ! ! !
it &apos;s a story at open , and he can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;ve been doing today is to show you a musik-sequencer for live-auftritte that we &apos;ve been developed recently , and agieren as sound like führungsstimme , bass and drums .
each has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can build in any pattern .
and you put them out by just holding a ton-siftable in a sequenz-siftable .
there are effects where you can change live , like hall and filters .
you connect it with a specific tone , and then tends to hire it .
and then even more problematic effects like speed and volume that you do on the sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we &apos;re starting to go into two sequenz-siftable in two sequenz-siftable and organize them in a row , extend them , expand and add them a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do some drums .
and now i plug on the filter with the drums , so that i can control live .
i can accelerate the sequence to speed up the sequence of one or another direction .
and now i plug on the filter with the bass , a little bit more expression .
i can change the sequence as it &apos;s happening .
and i don &apos;t have to do it in advance , but be able to improvise ; it &apos;s going to be extending it or fast .
and finally , i can ausblenden the whole sequence by running the lautstärke-siftable to the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my excitement is to develop new mensch-computer-schnittstellen , which is better to fit the way our brains and bodies work .
and today , i have time to give you a part of this new design-welt and some of the ways that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you to the way is that we &apos;re on the verge of this new generation of werzeugen to this new generation associated with digital media to bring information into our world that our demands .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m happy to talk to you all .
yes , good afternoon .
i &apos;m excited that i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
i just have to step back , and that &apos;s beschäftigt on the modern molecular biology .
i &apos;m studying molecular biology , for a few years now , for a few years ago , and that &apos;s what i started , because i just wanted to know what i &apos;ve learned , and also also wanted to do what i learned in studying .
so that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get a closer closer to the matter .
i think that molecular biology is generally now , so biotechnologie , biotechnology , everything you count about it counts , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important is already extremely important , and far more important , much more important in the future .
there &apos;s so controversial stuff like these all genetically engineered plants .
now , craig venter now , in the u.s.a , is trying to make biofuel , so they &apos;re trying to make gas from algae .
and then there &apos;s things that most of the most people have arrived at all the people , but not consciously , for example , for example , for example , allowing us to wash 40 degrees of laundry , are also integrating enzymes enzymes .
and the list can continue on endlessly .
and so , from the interest in this technology , i &apos;m just further on further .
so why now hacken ?
most people know that most people know this from softwarebereich .
computer hacken , and then it &apos;s going to be in the media , yes , the hackers will go somewhere and claws data , and so on .
this is very sad for the hackerszene very sad , because it &apos;s not true , what it actually starts like , and what &apos;s really about it .
and that is , the software-hacker , in the 1970s , achtzigerjahren with computerbasteln , and it &apos;s also created the internet .
and it &apos;s about being linked to a playful , creative , creative way to solve a problem .
and problem , it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a zugangsproblem of how simplify things , so it can be a question , a question , and how you can do it differently .
and it &apos;s been done with software , but there &apos;s also a lot of software , and there &apos;s also a whole bastlerszene that are doing all kinds of abgefahrenen things .
and now , in the direction of biology , that &apos;s what comes out of the synthetic biology , which is a more abstract code , which is , it &apos;s not quite the same as computers , because it &apos;s dynamic because it &apos;s matter , because it &apos;s matter , it &apos;s real matter , and not just cyber .
but it &apos;s also a code , and it &apos;s also a code , and it &apos;s also a code that you can also program , so you can also hacken , like that , and i found that i find incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper .
that actually has been accepted acht eight really acht , these networks .
there &apos;s hackteria dot dotcom , which is originally from switzerland switzerland , that &apos;s been switzerland and with cooperation and with cooperation in india , basiertes network , but there are now members or active people around the world .
this is a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a more artist , and philosophers and philosophers and working with scientists with scientists working with these technologies and questioning these technologies , and to process the creative , there &apos;s museumsausstellungen and yes , all sorts of things .
but it &apos;s actually always about finding access to finding access to having an practical approach to that .
and then there &apos;s do-it-yourself-bio dot , d.i.y.bio .
this is actually a network of u.s.a network , which is actually a kind of forum where you &apos;re talking to where you &apos;re discussing .
these are a little bit of technical scale , and also a little bit businessmäßiger , and then they &apos;re going to be asked , yes , ja questions .
and based upon these networks that have done the whole popular thing , it has developed a scene that i just want to be porträtieren .
and here in the front of the left , you see biocurious , which is a hackerspace , so basically a kind of school , so it &apos;s basically a private school , a private school , nonprofit , where everyone can reach .
kids , old , all kinds of people go there to just look through it , they &apos;ve set up a laboratory , and look at what can you do when these laborprotokolle laborprotokolle .
down here on the left is a group in indonesia , house-of-natural-fibers , which means that it &apos;s quite a long time .
more than those other networks .
they &apos;re engaging in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , also elektronikbasteleien , and combine this in a pretty abgefahre way .
a group that i &apos;ve met a while ago , which is a studentengruppe that i &apos;d like a while , you know , to the public care of the public , wanted to learn what they learn in college , and they &apos;ve tried to explain so on straßenfesten little actions and try to explain what d.n.a is .
and i got up in the other image in copenhagen in copenhagen in copenhagen in copenhagen in copenhagen , in combination with an exhibition .
and this is , yes , that &apos;s mostly rather young people , but the only thing united of them is what actually united states is this fascination with the technology .
and what you can do with this , and specifically to ask the society with the society , so okay , what do you know what you want to join you , have your interest , you have your interest in that ?
so , o.k , to hacken biology , you need some material .
of course , of course , you need biological materials , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s a laboratory .
or what you normally understand under a lab , which is sort of abgefahrene machines , extremely expensive , extremely distanziert , only for fachpersonal , trained academic academics , and so on .
and our approach was just to say , o.k , that actually you don &apos;t have to do that .
that &apos;s actually not necessary because each every one has actually evolved higher technologies than most laborgeräte technology , which is really .
and the premise with this premise with this premise then has tried to do brian degger zusammenzustellen in england , a minimallabor zusammenzustellen , and then genommen a dampfdruckkochtopf , and then , and , yes , so suppenbrühe , and then grew bacteria .
so anybody who &apos;s been able to get a soup of soup that it &apos;s too long .
i then went home in my lab , a bit a little bit , and then i put on ebay on ebay and bought a little bit of d.n.a analysis , trying to make a vaterschaftstest , so d.n.a fingerprinting , again , d.n.a home .
that shouldn &apos;t be a joke now .
so here in the lab , you see the lab , in anführungsstrichen garage , which has a gruppe garage , a group , in paris , in paris , which has launched what &apos;s place , and it &apos;s quite successful , and also pretty successful , and also quite interesting things , and i still want a project a project .
and this is biocurious , who also mentioned hackerspace hackerspace hackerspace , this , sort of , sort of volkshochschule for molecular biology .
and yes , you see , it &apos;s relatively heterogen , so that &apos;s where there &apos;s people who do it alone at their own home , up to big organizations , and so much more likely to do that in institutionalisierter form .
but always the reason that it &apos;s supposed to be easy and accessible .
the first project we &apos;ve been made as an international group , as an international group , when we were kind of aware of ourselves , are now there as real scene , and we are online , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people and i &apos;m going online and so .
and then the do-it-yourself-bio website came from the founders of the founder of the founder of org website , and i &apos;ve got to really meet , even meet real meeting , and then have two events organized , one in london , zweitausend 10 , and shortly in the u.s.a , in san francisco .
and , then , that &apos;s where it went , ja , yes , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to tell ourselves ?
and what are our values , and what is our goals , our basis ?
and then there we worked like that .
that was quite intuitive , so everybody has just got his desires , his and what &apos;s going on him , then said .
and i think , i think , a very good code .
and that &apos;s not verbindlich , and then it &apos;s not verbindlich , but that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done , i think , has been quite convinced that people are quite convinced .
and then , in fact , in the academic world , again , but there &apos;s somehow nothing that way .
so , i think we &apos;re out of the biohackerszene , in terms of a step further than the world of the world .
so , what do we actually do for projects like this ?
a project that i did with the hackteria-netzwerk in switzerland was that we wanted to create an optical trap or optical pinzette .
this is , when you focus a laser , in the room , you can capture little particles in the air or in the liquid , and then moving little particles in the liquid , so that &apos;s where you captured , like this kind of such a traktorbeamstrahl .
this really works , and we thought that it &apos;s going to be done in academic setting , and we thought , we might be able to take a webcam , the aufgeschraubt , the lens , the lens abgemacht , and then you have a microscope , you have about vierhundertfach .
you see that there .
and then we &apos;ve got a d.v.d brenner auseinandergeschraubt , and then we tried to focus on this camera and try to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , unfortunately , but we &apos;ve learned a lot about it .
so another project that &apos;s done in the french group , in paris , works , that &apos;s pretty cool .
so he &apos;s got so much such a hirnwellenmessgerät like this , such a hirnwellenmessgerät , or something like that , so he &apos;s busy with neurobiologie , his nickname is sam neurohack .
and he did this helmet that was built , and in cooperation with the museum .
and then the visitors in the room could go in the room , sit on this chair .
then their brainwaves measured , and depending on what they thought , or as they thought they were , are the different lights in the room .
was a fairly schickes project .
another thing from the united states , which also has to do with this vaterschaftstestgeschichte , is the p.c.r , that &apos;s the polymerase-kettenreaktion , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes to replicate , reproduce , d.n.a , so that you can make them visible .
so now , when i do that the profiler of the scene , then they collect any haarproben , and then they &apos;re going to do some haarproben , and then they can say , o.k , that hair belongs to this man .
and the machines that make this stuff are very expensive , quite expensive to buy commercial , the least they buy that at viertausend euro .
and that &apos;s not the hobbybereich , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be very much .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve said that two bastler rangesetzt , and they said that it was open source hardware , so they &apos;re zusammengebastelt hardware , so that this device zusammengebastelt , and now they &apos;ve actually got to get to get access , and are now the cheapest vendor of these devices worldwide .
i think sort of six dollars or something like that .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s still in any case in a framework where it &apos;s going to be clear .
so i think it &apos;s a very gelungener hack .
a project that i started recently was building a gene-gun .
gene-gun is , yes , like this kind of luftdruckpistole , which are sending about as far , two centimeters or something .
you lädt d.n.a on goldpartikel , and then you put it into the luftdruckpistole , and then i took that zwiebeln , and then put that kind of zwiebeln .
so the device that you see , it doesn &apos;t work .
but this is so my prototype , which , but it looked like this , in such a branch so on a branch , on a branch , on a branch , the thing on it , and the pressure , and that was the pressure was too high , it was broken .
and then i took a sahnespender and connected this .
a sahnespender , when you get the full pressure with water , it &apos;s enough pressure , so i think about 40 up to the sechtzig bar .
and then you can speed up particles , you can get strong enough , and then you go in it too .
and the commercial device costs about fünfzehntausend euros , or something like it , sahnespender for the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s essentially feasible .
so , that &apos;s right now , at the point of the scene of the scene , that the availability of technology , and also getting the information and the verständlichkeit , that more people can get engaged .
because , as in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea about it , and also not a chance of making it really well .
because when you read about it , it &apos;s not the same thing , it &apos;s not the same as if you did it yourself .
and i think technology is always becoming more important in our modern societies .
and when you want to be able to make some meaningful decisions in the society , you want to be able to make meaningful decisions in the society , you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it too and understand how to make it .
and then das under the schlagworten open knowledge and citizen science .
so you just be able to be able to be able to be able to be versetzt with these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s the kernanliegen of the biohackern .
these are the people who are at least officially put on the website , d.i.y.bio-dot-org website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and interesting is that they are also represented in southeast asia .
that &apos;s what i think there are fewer people in there than in fact .
so i know about some who don &apos;t put themselves .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
in part , with these hackerspaces , they put these places together , they put these places together .
and that &apos;s in the beginning .
as i said , zweitausendacht did it first started .
and hackerspaces , so the computerhackerspaces , because the c-base in berlin was the first , neunzehnhundertfünfundneunzig .
and this is now a giant network of very good , yes , infrastrukturzentren that are represented all over the world .
and , of course , of course , we hope that we &apos;re going to stop it , and then you &apos;re also going to be similar to , so that you can also get more involved in people .
and i would every once invite to deal with it , and try and try and try .
now it &apos;s not so easy , but it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity and enough energy , then you get far out there .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hello .
how do we really work ?
this is a question that makes me really moving as a designer , as a designer , but also , in forschungsbereich , and all of the things in the field of play .
it &apos;s about how to use people in interactive media so you can use these interactive media , and make them a very befriedigendes experience .
and because i think that the interactive media , in us , that the interactive media is adressieren , so the paradigm , so the paradigm that in our biology is very , very , very , very long , is einprogrammiert , and that we can only create through interactive media .
and that &apos;s amazing because in fact , you think that this hochtechnologie that you &apos;ve ever met in the future , you get into the future , but in fact , in fact , the future is that the future is right at us , in our archaischen roots .
what are actually archaische models ?
i wrote four stichworte , and i &apos;d like to explain a little bit about it .
so , to archaischen cognitive models , and that is the models that we have in the other time .
to these archaischen models , we &apos;ve heard that we have a natural relationship in 2100 .
that sounds basically unusual .
but i &apos;m going to go into it again , and i &apos;m going to take you and try to try and prove that you also have a natural ratio .
the second thing is that we &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to speak , because of these archaischen models , we &apos;re able to speak very , very bildlich , although we &apos;re using a kodifizierte language of language today .
and the third area that explains itself .
we all know that the interactive media is nonlinear by definition , which involves the denial of the linearity , and what of course tells us that we feel the linearity today as normal .
the fourth point is that the story is a place to be a place for us .
how this is now with virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing about the world .
i want to show you that .
how many doors did the house have to live in ?
so that we won &apos;t immediately answer them , but it &apos;s going to happen to happen right now .
you go through this house through this house , in demn you live , and look at how many doors are .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they virtualisieren the reality and no computers .
fantastic , right ?
and we give us a hard time for example , for example , the virtual reality in our v.r.-labor , we can do this already all the time .
and this wealth is the virtual fortune to virtualisieren the reality that people in the other way needed the other times , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any fotolitografie .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing that had was her head .
and in that head , that &apos;s a memory .
in this mind , abgerufen and with these virtual knowledge has been mithilfe with this virtual images of imagination , that was passed on .
and so it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with virtuality as well .
the interesting thing about this is if i can make a little trip .
yes , this is .
the interesting thing about this is that at this time , the human at the same time was the medienproduzent and medium itself itself .
now if you think about a little bit .
what are media today ?
you &apos;ll notice that it has given change .
but i &apos;ll be talking to that again .
the primary tools for informationsvermittlung has been history .
schamanen , priest , the so-called wissenswächter , were extra , to keep knowledge in stories .
and today , we &apos;re still hanging very , very strong stories .
the author of the book of the book , jonathan gottschall , jonathan gottschall , we verbingen , we still eintausendneunhundert hours of geschichten hours of stories .
this means for a child who has spent most of the time in the most of his life with the stories of stories .
now we think our love of stories depends on what we &apos;ve sat on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far missing .
this is a lot further back to the cultures of the nearest times .
but for me , in the domain of interactive media , as a result , is that we &apos;ve stuck in space in our biology , in our biological memory , the ability to think .
i brought you an example brought out of the north american tribe .
and life lived in the küstenregion of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very inselreiches area , and you had to navigate it somehow , from island to island to get food .
and they did the so-called lead-landkarten .
you may also know , if you &apos;re a little bit interested in this , by australian nations .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have a lead-landkarten , but they &apos;ve been using songlines songlines or traumpfade .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be mapped to the songs .
where the language is called untergeordnet untergeordnet rang .
that means you navigierte about sound and above rhythm .
and these sounds and the rhythm have the geology , the topography of a region , and it also enables you to be able to defragmentieren these songs the songs of the songs and assemble them into the left and go on the left , and also move back to the ausgangsort .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to get from the top a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s happening in fact ?
so this is what happens is this gennante machine machine .
we &apos;ve moved in what &apos;s called vogt-zeitalter .
and the machine happened is the book machine , and it &apos;s happened , and it &apos;s happened to happen .
and that &apos;s what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and our individual memories of our individual memories have shifted in external media .
on the book and the picture .
so , unfortunately , we have the god weit of god &apos;s weit .
virtuality has become alien to us strangers , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a well-known designforscher at the brighton-university , is to say that mass media , so it &apos;s not the book , and the internet , so it &apos;s not tv , and so on , and so on , what we call mass media today , that this mass mass mass mass media and our ability to virtualisieren erudiert .
we do a little zwischenbilanz .
from the vogt-zeitalter to machine machine .
what does affect our thinking and our erinnerungsvermögen ?
and then the verblassenden influence of the other cultures .
and they &apos;re going to be more and more überschrieben through the influence of the maschinenzeitalters .
that means to remind us , we have standardized , very widespread , very common patterns of memories that we can depend on our personal memories of personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce anymore .
we have an abstract language .
we don &apos;t think of the things in pictures that things are not in pictures , but we kodifizieren them our language .
we &apos;ve got it used to that things happen linear .
and we &apos;ve accepted the linearity as law , and there are only exceptions , like the non-linearität .
what &apos;s stayed on us is the storytelling .
still , we &apos;re very , very strong as informationsvermittlung as a informationsvermittlung .
the question is , what is now coming ? ?
we had the vogt -zeitalter , and we had this machine machine , and we &apos;re now going to take this so-called cyber-zeitalter .
it sounds very spacig , and it sounds very frustrating , and i know .
but these concepts of cyber-zeitalters that are bringing us to discover our capabilities again .
it &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about non-linearität , it &apos;s about storytelling .
i just want to explain a little bit .
there are technical concepts like example , for example , for example , in reality , that means the extended reality .
so if you look at google glasses for example , then a concept of what the virtual world does with the real world is to combine to combine the virtual world to be able to connect the virtual world , the virtual virtual world , the virtual world .
another example is something called virtual reality .
so , this kind of thing crazy in the relationship of my talk about my talk , of course , it may be physically moving , physically , virtual , virtual worlds , after the role of the holodecks .
and some other example are the ambienten , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to people .
all of this needs the ability to accept virtualität as a real habitat .
i graduated , and i hope that the video works , a very , very beautiful project , is the bachelorarbeit of michael burk , ann-kathrin krenz , joris klause and jan-moritz müller .
and the two letzteren are also here today .
maybe you can stand up for a second , so you can pause in the pause with the two over the break .
and i &apos;ve brought this project as an example , as i brought back to this archaischen , cognitive models .
the whole thing is , i have to say .
which of course , of course , was , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i say , if i say , you &apos;re very likely to see that any people , you know , you know , people who have some konsolen herumhappeln , or that they play with some konsole in their hands .
anyway , they &apos;re doing this .
that &apos;s a game out there .
and it turns out that i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , which is the data that we produce , that we produce with the real world .
i &apos;m sorry to be so powerful .
you can explain that much better , there &apos;s more and more than that .
that i discover a city by looking at a city by looking at which is positive or negative .
and so i get out of the city , a very different sight , a very different impression , which i see negative and positive zones of a city , in this way , it &apos;s a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
and we &apos;re going to watch now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another explanation of what you &apos;re seeing .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , it &apos;s clear .
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can see these virtual worlds .
so , in the case that , i &apos;d like to summarize the properties of mein , in the way that we have acquired the properties of cyber -zeitalters , and that we can be activated in this way , and that kind of complex , technology , technological , new products , actually , in fact , the future , but actually , we get back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
i &apos;ve just been asked , if this bag is a sprechender bag , and i &apos;m going to talk about it .
it won &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m also going to kick what &apos;s inside .
but so far , i &apos;m going to be a little bit curious about it .
yeah , kids are from nature , or should be curious , designers also .
i &apos;m a creator of house , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , changing the curiosity , and how change that curiosity , and why don &apos;t we lose curiosity , and why do we have to rethink it again , and so forth .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re dealing with the actual sense of existence as a creator .
when professors are curious , they &apos;re often forschungssemester in the n of forschungssemester .
and that &apos;s what i had over the last year .
a forschungssemester of natural user interface .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why begin to start thinking about as natural natural , archaischen urformen of communication , interaction and so forth .
and i just hold one of these little devices , because things are always supposed to be more intuitive , and more naturally natural , and more natural , and you have to look at it , which is , of course , of course , what &apos;s like to us , of course , of course , is benutzungsfreundlich or intuitive .
and in front of the background , i &apos;m in natural user interface , and so the next generation of design , which is the next generation in understanding computers with computers in the relationship with the human computer , how our tools , or how the computer has changed from the machine to the digital assistant .
so i &apos;m busy doing this , of course , of course , or intuitively .
maybe again , look behind it again .
why does this happen ?
so , if we look at the development of our society , right now , here briefly , we &apos;re moving down from the third of the third gesellschaftsgeneration or gesellschaftsform .
so from the modern computergesellschaft .
every society is shaped by a primärmedium .
at the beginning , the stammesgesellschaft of language .
that means you found a common language , and you could communicate a common language , you could communicate in the same the same cave , in the same cave , or other areas , in other areas , has built cities or gebildet cities , and sort of creating nen stammesgesellschaft .
but the primärmedium , but the language , something very natural , is very living something very living .
you also had to learn , you know , so no toddler can go from nature , but we &apos;re learning about , of course , of course .
that &apos;s then , you know , you know , by the ancient society , the first form of abstraction .
that was a riesen-aufschrei , of course , because , of course , the living language of natürlich in the form of writing in the form of writing , what &apos;s going on and alive and alive , i &apos;ll get it in stone , and i manipuliere it .
as i meißel , when i meißel , of course , of course , it &apos;s a different narrative , of course , when there &apos;s a living kind of alive .
but sukzessive was going to just take this script as a primärmedium .
then the next generation , the next generation , where we actually live in today .
this is just by the pressure and print geprägte writing and others .
it was the same thing that was damals , where the adel , klerus , and others said , are you really crazy when the people start reading the people , they want to join the people , and that &apos;s obviously totally fatal .
and now we come into the next generation and what is exciting , so a generationswechsel is just every few hundred years , and we &apos;re really at the moment in this phänomenalen period that we &apos;re involved .
and the confused us , of course , because we see the new media , socil social media , facebook and so on .
with total transparency , what the new thinking knallt is , don &apos;t say , don &apos;t say that in the lasagne pferdefleisch , you don &apos;t say that in beef , no beef , or other phenomena , i just want to vertuschen , and i want to do it .
and these two worlds are just starting together , new and old .
the exciting thing is , if you look at this new , this new society , these computergesellschaft , entlehnt , very many mechanisms , principles and archaischer paradigm , is out of the stammesgesellschaft paradigm .
but now no longer at a local level , but on a global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the subject ecology is a global .
not when i think local , and the neighbor is less organic , it &apos;s not going to work .
that is , in the local village , a global village has become a local village with the same principles , of course , very intuitive , but total transparency .
when you in the village , you know , in the village , who has what &apos;s going on who , and when , this is what &apos;s happening today about these erweiterung of self through these mobile selves in a global scale .
be that we know globally and faster and faster and more and faster .
as it was happening in the village , it was happening .
in front of the background , in front of the background , what really means , of course , of course , what we might have , of course , what we may have also verlernt , what we might have , but instinctively , what makes us difference ?
because people are always coming , and they can &apos;t do it , so they can &apos;t do it so anybody with it .
so , you have to think about what &apos;s called , because it &apos;s not just easy to change it , it &apos;s different , but it should be better .
and when of course , something intuitive , of course , and how i can take a creator of influence , and make things like this , that they &apos;re a benutzungsfreundlich , very intuitive , as intuitive , because then they &apos;re having fun and they &apos;re easy to use .
you know , you know , during the student , in the perception of perception and wahrnehmungspsychologie .
and this is of course , of course , where you start and look and say , okay , now i just look inside the inner self .
and what &apos;s it going on in there ?
so how do we work when we get there ?
and what does it mean , of course , of course , intuitively and how do the cognitive processing work work ?
because steve jobs used to say you &apos;re need to dig deeper to understand it .
so you have to really see in the details , if i want to make something benutzungsfreundlich or intuitive handhabbar , which means that in the core .
and you can see that you have our seven senses , most of our seven senses , you know , is only seven , now it &apos;s actually seven anerkannte , because certainly in the near future , the next , eighth sense , and also as an extension of our self .
and to look , how do we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
a lot of people use the word , knowledge , but not what it means en detail .
but i need to be able to understand in the core of the essence of information , when information is information to information , when data comes from information , and from information , so that i know how to do things as well as things , or of course , to do things .
and , of course , design is what design matters to perception .
and we see this here when i do things , if i do things , i can make them confusing like on the right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can make it sort of intuitive to show things .
so much more natural , in a vessel , but i see directly where is salt and pepper pepper .
and when i tell someone , give me salt or pepper , and then he will be thinking about where it &apos;s in .
and then , in fact , in the left just intuitive , and hopefully , i hope that there is no sugar in there that just give you salt to it .
but also our perception of self , how does it täuscht us .
for example , this perception of the context .
and the right circle looks larger than small , even though that &apos;s not the case at all , but they &apos;re the same size , and yet , our perception , depending on what context we see .
anyone knows what that is ?
come on .
pattern recognition should work .
there &apos;s a little bit more to my glasses .
so it &apos;s the n circle .
a second circle starts to engage in certain ways or relate to them .
and then , if i hold a halboval dazusetze , we don &apos;t even see a unit , a circle , circle , and yet we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle , another .
it &apos;s called gestaltgesetz or eben , which also affects us in perception .
for the creator , for designers , they usually have the first semester , the great gestaltgesetze .
moving close to the continuity of the continuity and so on .
in the third of the third time .
but this is essential to an essential thing , if you just want to design things very intuitive .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting that this vision .
now , first , very banal , but it &apos;s exciting , but it &apos;s exciting if you &apos;re engaged in it .
so we have the eyes in the front , and now you think we &apos;re looking at the beginning of the beginning .
that &apos;s wrong .
you &apos;re looking at the beginning from the back .
and that &apos;s what you see in the front of you can see what you can recognize , beispielweise circle .
that means we can only see , before we see it , before we see it back in the back of our seheapparat , to say , okay .
i have cognitive rückkoppelung , you have what you want to see .
that &apos;s then , again , again , that &apos;s coming back .
and then it &apos;s going forward , because the back in the back , because the back in the back of the front of the front and say , you know , actually , you know , and please go ahead and feel like what you see , that &apos;s what you want to see .
and then again , again , and then it &apos;s going to be done .
so a whole , very spannender process process of how certain things are going on and what &apos;s going on to do these things .
i don &apos;t know who knows this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing i described .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to see something out of this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes .
does anybody see something ?
a dalmatiner , right .
once i &apos;ve seen that there &apos;s a dalmatiner in there , you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget it anymore , because i &apos;ll show you where the dalmatiner is .
now you see the dalmatiner .
and further , now you see it always .
that means i actually verdorben them to the fact that they don &apos;t recognize any patterns , but i &apos;ve got them back in a very short time , and again , again , again , again , this dog image .
and this is this projection of vision , rückkopplung .
now i &apos;m going to know it , and now i &apos;m looking forward to the front of the dalmatiner .
i see the dalmatiner .
so , really exciting processes that then , in this , yes , it &apos;s actually not , you don &apos;t actually know , but there &apos;s a lot of mass in this rosanen crowd .
does anybody know what three seconds are ? ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
if i know something , it takes three seconds , until i sort of get out of the present , and then i can bridge very well , very well , überbrücken , where i &apos;ve always been doing it with three seconds .
it just has to process as a present .
and then it moves into the past , and so i can bridge very elegant wartezeiten , for example , if i know this phenomenon .
what takes fünfundzwanzig milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
also an interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time that you fall in love .
now that means that if you know that , if you know who you know how long you look like a long time , because i don &apos;t have any gewähr for what can happen so much .
and sechzehn milliseconds , also an interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the most time period that we have .
that means , this first idea is happening in a rapid fast speed of how we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re looking at the environment , as well as our environment , so we can think about that .
and of course , , of course , the designers are not only concerned with perceptions and neural verarbeitungen or kognitionsergonomie , but naturally , with the theme of mensch-objekt-beziehung .
so how about a human being entsprechend with certain things .
there &apos;s a lot of things that you have , you have the practical functions , and so formale things .
there are anzeichen-funktionen , where i know exactly where i have to reach .
but there are symbolic functions , why is someone going to do for such a little täschchen , where does someone hardly do anything like that , so horrende sums of money , even though it &apos;s not so practical ?
there we are more likely to be on the symbolischen , on the bedeutungsebene , with which we have , of course , as a creator , of course .
back to my actual subject , natural user interface and the topic , which of course , of course , is usability .
usability means , how can i really quickly achieve a certain goal , or how can a users , in a certain case , in a certain way , is effective , effectively , to be able to do a goal .
so it &apos;s more like the norm .
how can i do something more benutzungsfreundlich ?
i can take this directly to operate , or i &apos;m going to use &apos; a manual , or i &apos;m going to have a really true training .
and less usable or benutzungsfreundlich is it .
i &apos;m not doing it in a different way , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you also have to understand .
and then , in part , in part of the software that we &apos;ve just seen , you &apos;ll understand why neunundneunzig percent of our current piece of software , or not to anhieb , is perhaps embedded in a lot more intuitive or i-phone accordingly , even though it &apos;s been substantially more intuitive than classical software .
and intuitive is not only an intuitive artist for apple benutzbarkeit , not only for apple wirtschaftsfaktor , if i just want to harness the technological devices .
why ?
because in fact , we &apos;re usually using this new kind of nutzbarkeit , so the natural user type , for example , the natural user , for example , are five times more likely on average .
you have to imagine that if you take something of the classical softrware , five hours , and this new kind of natural software is just an hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re allowed to go home four hours of hours , but your employers , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;ve been able to deal with her four hours .
but i want to say that it &apos;s , of course , of course , to make certain things that , of course , of course , to make certain things .
when we &apos;re moving back in the field of software , so the first command line interface , which were very abstract , is where you have to take months of dealing with these systems .
then the next , the next thing that came with a nem brain or mental model like the software are saying , you &apos;ve been working , and you have an idea of something that &apos;s metaphor , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to harness the computers .
so , no longer and ones or kryptische code , but a metaphor .
that &apos;s already a lot of benutzungsfreundlicher , but , of course , much better .
the next generation of graphischen benutzungsoberflächen works very much more with behavior .
so i make a creator as a creator very much more frequently behavior than that .
that &apos;s also an paradigm shift .
that i think this is always unwichtiger for success , just the usability of application .
and then when i take a step into this natural user user interface , where i take a step , by the language , by touch , by gesture , by gesture , by gesture and cursor , it has to control things , then i &apos;m more faster and down .
but again , that leads me to the point , when are things more intuitive ?
if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to go back to my little friend here , and you know , what does this mean that &apos;s the point of view , when it &apos;s more intuitive ?
and that &apos;s for us people is always an intuitive , if i &apos;m very little thinking about it .
so he doesn &apos;t seem to think of it , it doesn &apos;t seem to think of it .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is more intuitive .
and what does that designers mean ?
that means that when we look at some existing technologies we can transmit on some other things , for example , for example , the metaphor , then i can use that as a creator .
that means , i can just transfer an intuitive , human handlungsmodell on software , and make the software of the software .
now , of course , the question is , what &apos;s actually the intuitivste handlungsschema of us humans , and now i &apos;ve done it .
this is the so-called osit-modell .
this is an acronym , and it &apos;s an acronym , and it &apos;s an acronym , and it &apos;s an acronym and steht , selektieren .
all of you do that all of you , but it makes you unconsciously , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive , or partly instinctively .
the model is already going to be ausprägt in the womb , and it &apos;s interkulturell , so it works with young and old , and it &apos;s used all the time , without most of us know that most of us knew that this model is there .
osit osit is going to be about 50 to siebzigtausend times of us in activity , so in the head of sleep , you know , it &apos;s less often strapaziert than a day .
now , i can get this mental memory , orientieren , selektieren , informieren , transagieren into a interaktionssystem .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the desktops , but it &apos;s not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a handlungsmusters , a handlungsprinzips .
and this is on a higher grail of the benutzungsfreundlichkeit as the transmission metaphor of a classic metaphor , which is the desktops .
and when i &apos;m übertrage , for instance , for example , for instance , for example , in the case i &apos;m übersicht , for example , it comes up to me , and i can look at it , and yes , transagieren , i mean , i can put it somewhere in somewhere or send someone to someone , or shop .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to do this by a beispiels .
it has already eaten pies .
übersicht : so now i interact with the object , kann , again , reinzoomen .
i &apos;m getting all the overview of this , i can now filter this in this , and say , just show me all with chocolate for example .
and once in one interface , what &apos;s an intuitive and a lot more natural and much more natural .
because i can reach things like the bits , touchen , and they come to me , is a lot more natural than hierarchisch organized websites , or other mechanisms , to sort of doing these things .
imagination is more important knowledge , and with this sentence , i &apos;d like to end up with a , and again , also , again , designers have to think differently , to think about new solutions , and in that sense , i thank you very much welcome to your attention and please .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first one , when you &apos;re a child , if you get a child , you know what you do , yes ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to play more or less in the töpfchen and move , the more , kind of curiosity , of course , that you will , of course , of course .
and curiosity won &apos;t learn .
that are all of those who are here and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn from .
i &apos;m going to do this , basically , all of these umweltdiskussion , weltuntergang , 40 years , club-of-rome , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point here .
and it depends on phosphorus .
give pee a chance .
they spend every day , they spend about two grams of phosphorus , and every day they have to pick up two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only glide as a amorphe mollusken through the weltmeere .
if we don &apos;t , in fact , no phosphorus .
and amazingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re looking at something about something that we &apos;re doing , which is selbstverständlichkeit .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the phosphor-problem .
the phosphor-problem is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have the phosphorus for two years , and already now it &apos;s been used to be much more uranium in the world , more uranium than it &apos;s used to be used in the environment .
in the last 20 years alone , fünfzehntausend tons of uranium have been distributed to our fields in germany .
and we take it all up .
it &apos;s making leukemia books .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , schütz the environment , drive less car .
schütz the environment , make less waste .
schütz the environment , verbrauche less energy .
it &apos;s not protection .
this is as if i &apos;d say , schütz your child , it only three rather than five times .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
so if we think about the wiege to the bahre , our entire world is going to be a friedhof .
so , in order to think of wiege to wiege .
and the most important thing about this is to look at the ground as the first thing .
on the ground , over 60 percent of the kohlenstoffs is stored .
right now we &apos;re building corn , and we lose corn and lose between 11 and 30 pounds of 30 tons per hectare of 30 tons per hectare .
that means we &apos;re going to lose at the ground about five thousand times more .
and we can see , of course , of course , of course .
and it &apos;s all packaging or content .
for example , for example , in offenbach , in 20 , twenty percent of the müllmenge are now windeln .
and because we get older , they will be bigger .
they &apos;re all in the vorwindelphase .
yes ?
a baby needs about six thousand windeln windeln .
so we could reduce that about 10 percent , but what does that do it ?
this is wird in china in a second .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go to this windeln ?
so one of the evidence here is that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is emitted in the pigs behind the festen bestandteile .
people about the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s done , right ?
traditionally , we think in the umweltdiskussion , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you say to people who are when you say it , you know , if you say , it &apos;s better , you weren &apos;t there , you &apos;re going to be raffgierig and hostile .
and so someone like al gore , one of our great heroes , is not wichtigeres to stabilize the human population .
in israel , if you &apos;re rettest , you know , you &apos;re rettest the earth .
here it says , the more you umbringst , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really really ? too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about four times more than us .
i could also use termites , but in the united states , no termites like that , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means that the ants weigh a lot more than us .
and because they &apos;re physically working much harder than we are and because they only live three to six months , they are in their weight , in their energy consumption , something 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and how far away we want to get away from that we really wanted to get away , and how sad we are , we are at all on earth , you can see , for example , for example , a program has a program to have 20 40 40 over here , yes ?
you can only be klimaneutral if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only opportunity .
have you ever seen a klimaneutralen tree ?
yes ?
one ? one ? ?
that means our whole intelligence means we want to be dümmer as a tree , yes ?
yes ?
no tree is kohlenstoffneutral .
luckily not , right ?
there &apos;s no überbevölkerungsproblem in trees .
there are six hundred billion trees alone in amazonasgebiet .
you &apos;ve already heard about some of the überbevölkerungsproblemen trees ?
that means all our intelligence means we want to be dümmer as the trees .
and where you can see , even something like demeter , the strikteste bio- , you can &apos;t allow our own stoffwechselprodukte .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really have to go back .
and we are too many .
it alone .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re feeling so guilty about the earth that we say . there &apos;s no bio-landbau , no bioland , no bioland , no nature-et-progrès , no nature-et-progrès , that allow us to go back to our own exkremente .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it makes sense to be less harmful , which is less harmful .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our environmental footprint , but it &apos;s about to have a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for the society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it comes to the environment , the highest thing is not to be there ?
nullemissionen , yes ?
you can only have nullemissionen if you &apos;re not there .
even if they were shooting now , they would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can get our nutrients back .
we go back to brazil in brazil , where we get the nutrients back .
right , we can put nutrients in this way nutrients in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china , for example , where we take the trash .
in china , a nachttopf today is honigtöpfchen , sort of honigtöpfchen , right , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , our nutrients .
that means that the whole western zivilisationsgeschichte draws itself from that the city has never taken back , but the farmers never had returned .
and it had to grow the cities more and more , because farmers went into the cities , and the cities still had to move their nutrients away .
so all that western empires are always expanding until they don &apos;t have the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re implodiert .
yes ?
it was different . it was different .
you &apos;ve done bruchlos civilization over five years , because you &apos;re always able to zurückzubringen the nutrients .
even today , if you invited to eat the food in china , you expect to eat , that you &apos;re expecting to see the toilet .
because it &apos;s unfreundlich , to go and take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve got them to eat them , not to the nährstoffdiebstahl .
that means you can see the internet as you can get the nutrients back .
this actually , when you do this , if you do this , you know , in a hectare of country with five thousand people in favelas , there can be a farmer for about eintausendfünfhundert dollars , and the facility for , chickens and ducks and enten and vegetables and fish .
and the great thing about this is the verbrechensrate in the favelas around ninety percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people who are very little bad .
we can support them to be good .
that &apos;s high-tech-landwirtschaft , of course , but the plants carry themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed so , through design that a farmer can easily manage it .
that means that they go back to the verbrechensraten .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve now built over hundertfünzig in the last 20 years , none of these facilities have ever been sabotiert .
you could just reinwerfen a liter of altöl and then it would be ruined over years .
don &apos;t find .
that means we don &apos;t need to control people who are very little worse .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to zurückkriegen phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you &apos;re going to write yourself , in germany , you know , at the best treatment treatment , is in frankfurt .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not in offenbach , but maybe you can help the frankfurtern .
because the frankfurter plant could get the phosphorus back .
and it needs to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it works .
we &apos;ve used in holland now over three years .
the government has explained , you know , you will be the first country zurückgewinnt .
but we need all overall .
you understand , there are two countries who control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s phosphorvorkommen .
there is opec a bunch of waisenknaben .
these are sechsundzwanzig countries that control 40 percent of ölvorräte .
and we &apos;re going to replace oil by others .
but you can &apos;t replace the phosphorus .
so it &apos;s not about making the existing one less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and in fact , first of all , asking what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
in the holland , it &apos;s easier because in holland , this is the land built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if your wife &apos;s sad , if your wife , you &apos;re going to be sad , and you &apos;re coming to the fünfzig .
completely inefficient .
but it &apos;s really effective , right ?
or take a lippenstift .
a woman in germany is about six pounds of three kilograms in their lifetime .
there .
that &apos;s not exactly the same thing , because we don &apos;t know how much weggeküsst is there .
but a lippenstift , even with this lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but effectively , right ?
all of the stuff in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not resource resource efficiency , but efficiency .
ask , what is the right ?
it &apos;s not even going to burn a little bit better and burning it into the verbrennungsanlage and lose all the materials to lose all the materials , but first to ask , how do you bring together loops ?
you can imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
when i put them up for dinner , and i say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with offenbach-geschmack and a glass of water .
wonderful , huh ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you &apos;re in somebody falling in love , efficiently ?
yes ?
that means , everything that matters in life is not about saving .
all the umweltdiskussion .
we tell people , oh , yes , you don &apos;t have no green in the south .
no , that throw away exactly the right , yes ?
every one of you , where you &apos;re wegwirft , yes , you do lebensmöglichkeiten .
but the wrong thing .
if you put the wrong things out , you have a müllproblem .
in the way from the north .
there is everyone footprint there .
if you walk , yes , everybody destroys the floor .
because the ground is going to die the mosses die and the wind and the water , and the water is washing down the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , everyone is that means that the water is in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that &apos;s going to be a feuchtgebiet .
not schuldmanagement .
we say , in germany , sustainability .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how about your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , herzliches beileid , yes ?
that &apos;s a minimum .
so don &apos;t save .
every waste is nährstoff .
and it &apos;s like a lust , if you see in italy , in italy , like people in the high bow , it &apos;s like a car coke and out of the car .
because you know , this is a lustvoller process .
it &apos;s the shape of revierverhalten , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
for instance , for instance , for example , which is liquid .
they can wegschmeißen where they go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re building around everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants , so that they &apos;re contributing to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there are two cycles .
not everything should be kompostierbar .
a tv machine or a washing machine , they just don &apos;t use them .
just the things that verschleißen , like schuhsolen , such as bremsbeläge , like autoreifen , you have to be in biological systems .
the things that just are used to be used in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
not for the company puma per se , but for that company , they now help to make these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t do things anymore .
yes ?
so , when i go to the food and say , this is free of hähnchen , then you don &apos;t help anything .
no , we lay on what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like detox .
not in it .
but everything in it is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can go to fußgängerampel and go and go back to the biologische in biological cycles , right ?
everything is kompostierbar of it .
and if we manage it , of course , of course , of course , for nike , for nike , for hennes and mauritz and all the textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the abwasserprobleme around the world that are caused by the textile industry .
so , they help them ask for people in the people .
hey , puma , power are you really serious ?
because they have now changed the vorstandsvorsitzenden twice .
and i &apos;m not as sure if they really dabeibleiben .
so , help me a little bit .
but it &apos;s going .
yeah .
what has just been presented .
this is .
so we can make things like that , if you verschleißen , you can do things in biological cycles .
technical cycles is exactly the same .
there &apos;s a direct rücknamesystem for this .
this is the first green backpack , actually that &apos;s being done in the circulation .
that &apos;s also , in each store , you can zurückkriegen things .
if you get to this , yes ?
do you remember the windel again ?
at the moment is the trash .
all over these windeln are windeln , almost .
in the countries where people get to money .
the front of the deponien , but else in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastics , it can go to biological systems , if we can change the wasserspeicher , inside that they can just go back to zellulosebasis , then they can plant a baby in israel or in tunisia of hundertfünfzig trees .
yes ?
if you take these windel , you zerkleinern , sterilisieren , sterilisieren and the powder to plant trees .
so the baby is kohlenstoffpositiv for the whole life , from the beginning .
so we don &apos;t need to be klimaneutral , we can be klimapositiv .
it &apos;s kind of a beneficial poop print .
yes .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can even reinvent it .
i started an institute .
in the whole lot of people who are working there , and they can get engaged .
there are extra a group that &apos;s cradle-to-cradle-verein , where everyone can join .
so no longer save , verzichten , avoid , not schuldmanagement , but it &apos;s intelligent waste .
does it feel curious ?
thank you .
the work of interpreten .
music as a language .
in the description of my talk , i wrote that i was interpretin , as a übersetzerin , so in english , i understand .
interpreten are the geschriebenen of the written notes in klingende music .
that if you don &apos;t just take a translator to the text in a different language , but also the deeper sense of the words of words , and understanding the deeper sense of words that it makes a good translation translation , anyone knows it with fremdsprachen .
being able to translate the english to english , you can take more knowledge , rather than it &apos;s for poetry , or at all about poetry .
but it &apos;s really strange about what we do to musicians with our musiksprache .
as a interpretin , i first have the written the written notes .
you think that the composer in the notes has exactly everything that he has imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and ungenau .
these notes are about exactly the same or ungenau , like a verbal partnership , as well as a verbal sense , as well as much as a sense of a landscape of a landscape .
because in this verbalen landschaftsbeschreibung , the smell of the flowers is not to smell , the level of the flowers , just to no clue to a clue , not to feel .
that means that the interpreter has to be diese , you know , the notensprache data in a different one , which is hörbare , concrete , non-verbal musiksprache .
today i want to share with you what i would say to you , interpretiere , translate into a verbal language .
so basically a translation of the translation .
so , i prefer to do it much of german to german , because if i also had to translate it to english , it would be gleichbedeutend for me to translation the translation of the translation .
so , the music works for me as much as the spoken language .
the notierten notes have the function of the letters of a script .
so it &apos;s not going to take just music to read at the piano on the piano , and press on the piano on the piano on the piano , right ?
that &apos;s just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of the letters you can only see when you can do the language .
and so you need to take for the learning process of music as long as long as spoken language .
that &apos;s where you can also learn whether you learn it for the hausgebrauch , you know , can only be passively , or you can talk to the musical speaker .
the interpreten of the interpreten starts like a theaterregisseurs .
after first , you &apos;ve chosen to play a piece , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re going to take the hintergründen of the composition of the composition of the composition .
you collect information about the piece in sekundärliteratur .
you read in the letters , tagebüchern , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts from composers .
they studied the works that he had written before and afterwards .
you compare . you compare .
the beweggründe to write it .
what was he was feeling ?
how were its circumstances , how did society and politics ?
all of that .
you think in this time , you think of contemporary images or literature .
but in the time , you have , however , but you also have a rich knowledge for the composers that you &apos;re playing a lot of times , and it &apos;s easier to feel like you and feel .
the composer will always become more to the friend that you live with .
his cause to write the piece is becoming more and more and more to my personal concerns .
now , since the notes , everything else is a genaue record of the author , but just a framework , it &apos;s just a framework , i &apos;m going to turn this framework to make sense with meaning and meaning it .
and then i say to my own words , which could be written between this framework .
i play erklärend , which these sound could mean .
now for me , and for composers , and what did they mean for him today .
every phrase , every phrase , gets a sense of every phrase , because i feel it yourself , because i think it , personally , personally , gelebten .
it has to be stimmig for me now , and now i can &apos;t convince my audiences that i can &apos;t convince my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve worked as long in advance of how new experience .
as you remember happy a happy day , even though , even with the same rituals of life , up to the same rituals of your life , your breakfast work , you get up to work , as well as well as you go back to the new rituals .
and again , i &apos;ve become older , change seasons , and my pulse goes down to slow down at the morning , in a konzertsaal , it takes longer to come back home than at home .
i &apos;m going to take true the audience , consciously , or unconsciously .
all of that affects me and all of this affects my experience with the composition .
well , it &apos;s a wonderful thing , when i &apos;m standing on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , angeregten conversation .
you get a new idea in it and you say that &apos;s what it &apos;s answered with a response .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we don &apos;t have , and whatever you can &apos;t have samples .
it makes great fun to make music in this way , and then you experience how the music communicates to life .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more , like this moment .
i can &apos;t play as well as in 20 years today .
so i &apos;m going to have more lebenserfahrung than today , and that is why i &apos;m going to have a lot more farbnuancen on my palette of musikklänge , emotions and emotions as today .
i &apos;m going to then have some rausgeschmissen , but i &apos;m going to have new dazubekommen .
have a nice example of that .
it was on a klavierkursus for musikstudenten in my beloved old teachers , professor jürgen ude , a known beethoven-spezialist beethoven-spezialist , konzertpianist , langjähriger , a langjähriger professor of musikhochschule here in stuttgart .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so that he was emeritiert when i finally started studying .
but i was lucky enough to meet him with 13 13 , and so i &apos;ve been to meet in high school .
i was 17 , when i went back on one of his courses , and played the last one of the four balladen of the chopin , a spätwerk .
he asked me what the introduction of this ballade was .
that &apos;s a getragenes part .
and in my jugendlichkeit , i said , expectation .
and he said , he said , so ?
that must be the altersunterschied .
because for me , she means memory .
he was over sechzig .
well , with 17 , you have dreams , but there &apos;s no long-term memories .
i play this piece today , and it &apos;s always gone out of me , even though , although not a single note .
every time it &apos;s exciting , it &apos;s exciting , again , i read something new .
one of a very different area of it has painted the seerosen x-mal .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but of different tageszeit light .
he was able to translated the seerosen verschiedentlich , as he saw it , as she looked at it at this moment .
his personal impressionen of seerosen .
the x-malige interpretation of a piece is comparable .
now i &apos;ve been more older than chopin , when he was writing the piece .
he was living only more neununddreißig years .
and it &apos;s important to me , again , looking at the notes , even though i would memorize them .
to keep zwiesprache , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially if he died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said yes , you need to have it for the same time for the spoken language .
so often the musikunterricht is that you just learn the notes .
you just learn to read it before you just speak a word .
you learn to figure out the notes on the instrument .
when all the fingers in time and just as it is in the notes , they come up , they come out , they sound like music that sounds like music .
if that &apos;s happening , the students get the nächstschwierige piece .
and the interpretation of interpretation is not spoken .
all right , there &apos;s presto on the front , which is a quick piece .
lento , slowly .
out loud and r and b , etc . .
most of you know that .
but also , when you put them up , it &apos;s still just something technical .
and yet , it &apos;s always not the interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something elementares .
namely , to make music on the instrument , to do your musical musical and feel there should be there before .
that &apos;s what singing .
a kid who don &apos;t sing it is because it doesn &apos;t have the parents , it &apos;s not going to do it .
this is like sprechenlernen .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music in order to make it about another possibility , so about an instrument to sound .
people who never gesungen , as it has never been singing with your body , actually felt like it is to make a sound .
a phrase with his own breath .
because the instrument is an extension of our body .
our vocal chords to singing our hands and feet to dance .
this is the hammerköpfe in the piano the sequel of my fingers .
the tune out of the tune and the tune out of the dance .
the dauernde berieselung today with music is not förderlich .
you don &apos;t need to make music anymore if it gets bored .
no more needed to whistle or sing .
each of your own music is plattgemacht when you keep out on the outside with music .
sure , there &apos;s some of you who say yes , but what do you do if i didn &apos;t sing ?
i ask the question , can you not sing , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to try to figure out if they can &apos;t , or learn how to learn these little muscles that hire the vocal chords , right .
because you can train .
or c , because you &apos;ve got it bescheinigt .
i &apos;m asking , how fachlich competent was this diagnosis ?
did you have a zweit- or drittmeinung , just how you say it &apos;s beautiful now ?
or d , they don &apos;t have music , and they want to do not want to do anything .
and then what i was going to do , because music is a beautiful , kommunikative thing .
but maybe you can also umstimmen them .
well , you see , all of the cases don &apos;t have to be a aussichtsloser candidate .
but don &apos;t tell me , i don &apos;t understand the classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i said , but surely you can tell you if you don &apos;t like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it &apos;s somebody , i don &apos;t know if it tastes me , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , you don &apos;t get rid of food , just because you can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music , because they don &apos;t have to play an instrument .
listen consciously and tell you if it tastes you or not .
whether it &apos;s to gepfeffert or sweet .
tell what you feel .
in the time you get some standards , and you want to get a little spices , and you want some spices to even fine differences .
why am i asking for my audience now to listen to action ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate .
a piece of art that you never look at has no force .
the food that was cooking from a chef or a cook likes to have to be eaten and not just looked at or ausgetauscht .
so listen , you know , if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice geräuschtapete .
when an animal where the adults do action , or at least listen to music , is a child who grows up , it &apos;s easy to ask , to ask , what color has your flower ?
now can you also play in blue ?
and the child plays , after a gedenkpause , rather than a red flower now .
and this sounds very different than before .
that was the very first beginning of a musical expression .
so the first step to a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today , that originally was written a hundred , zweihundert or even three hundred years ago ?
now , the instruments are fortentwickelt .
there was bach as an instrument even at all .
it was just not invented yet .
i think that bach would have been thrilled if he had the klanglichen possibilities of the modern people &apos;s possibilities .
i can see the klangvorstellungen that the stream has had , on the modern wing to sound , which can be a barockes barockes .
and also , by beethoven knows , he heard more hearing when he was deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that has an orchestra at the time as a unspielbar .
so the composers rely on us all the composers that reinvent the pieces .
so that they get up , what they have in the mind .
and also , what you would think about today in the mind .
or what i &apos;m vorstell today , because what you could have thought .
thank you .
you know what envy ?
were you neidisch once ?
and how did that feel ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
and then when i come back with my little jo , w and i &apos;m going to be here , that feeling .
i shoot something through the head .
i say , ulf , what do you need big car ?
that &apos;s the first year loses half of his value .
and at all , you work much less than me .
why does i have to afford to do little car ?
and then it falls to me immediately , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , it &apos;s an awkward feeling .
our organism invented a great method to get these unpleasant feelings like envy .
you can also try this with words like revenge or gewinnsucht or something .
i want to explain with that mechanism today , or a little bit näherbringen , which you probably are familiar with .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie of the lie , as you may have heard , when people say , no one has to build a wall .
and then rocks out , so he &apos;s versperrt them .
on a lie like that a lie , you see the liars doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to check out that it has very different in mind .
he &apos;s just merely täuscht and not himself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about , which has to deceive themselves .
they &apos;re going to take this lie to get a lebenslüge , .
they can get less easy , yes , nachprüfen , whatever .
you need time .
now , from this time , an anecdote you might know .
the spanish painter pablo picasso once did a woman .
this woman was beschwert , the portrait would not look like it .
picasso says , just wait .
it will always be more similar to you .
at this point , and when you laugh , you realize how important this lie is , and how much time you need to know what artists can tell us about .
because artists have a gestörtes relationship to the lie .
the artist shares something with them , and especially this lady , which she doesn &apos;t see if they just look in the mirror .
the artist shares you in a portrait of something that you &apos;re very familiar with , if you look at this piece of art .
and then this awkward sense , this awkward feeling , you know , couldn &apos;t look at all , and it will always be more similar to you .
here you have this mechanism that we can call the lie as a great invention to the stabilisierung of our lebensverhältnisse .
and not just in art , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , it comes back .
you may know this idea of the lady that looked at every morning in the mirror and asked him who was the most beautiful in all of the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a schönere .
behind the seven mountains , and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true auskunft , also the mirror can &apos;t lie , from that true auskunft .
but we should just make sure that you can &apos;t tell a woman that you can &apos;t say , you know , somewhere else .
here &apos;s what we need to understand under politically correctness , and put back again .
we need that we need this lie to that lie to deception , without we can &apos;t even live .
we don &apos;t only have art in the art of volksmärchendichtung , but in science , but in science , in science , lies like this great .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s bischofs .
she heard from this book by charles darwin , the emergence of species and the descent of human beings .
that the human being sollte out of the monkey , at least , there would be a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her husband to her husband and she said that &apos;s not true what charles writing .
the human condition should have abstammen or have a common ancestor .
no , no , no , no .
and if it &apos;s true , we need to prevent people from being aware of it .
why do we prevent people from something else if it &apos;s true ?
because we cannot live without those lebenslüge .
because we selbsttäuschung this selbsttäuschung , this feeling of being great , from one of the naturebene creatures like such a naturebene , like an organism that exists yet , still exists , it &apos;s like a stone , and what else things , that &apos;s for us .
so we can &apos;t bear these things .
we need to prevent people from things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so , you can see how slowly this mechanism auflöst and how the traces of tracks that it leaves that are leaving that lead to something else in this great picture of ourselves , i want to give you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
my wife told me she told me .
she came from the school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she said about a student .
a autistischer student .
it &apos;s especially like you , because it has a propensity for sincerity .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire department .
and because i &apos;m in the fire department , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnische things .
yes , you know , if you &apos;re heiter on this place . there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , whenever a man is in a moral place , in a moral place because , we should try to replace it with the wörtchen .
do that once , and then you know the sentence .
although i &apos;m in the fire department , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnische things .
you feel that this is the actual truth behind the force .
but that &apos;s not really interested in feuerlöschen .
that &apos;s what interests .
but there are no clubs , where we can see where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second best fire fire .
he signed up .
and überdies , you also don &apos;t tell his teacher that you would say you &apos;d like to put fires somewhere , and you want to be excited when the fire leaves hochlodert .
no , it just looks much better if we &apos;re going to show that we &apos;re in charge of trying to eliminate the dangers of the other , if they put on fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
so this verweis , in the innersten of the bub , knew that he &apos;s actually related to the fire , but it can &apos;t say that loud .
and here you have this zensor between the unconscious and conscious that you can &apos;t do about it , and the things you know , you look very differently , so designed that you can make a lot better for you and others .
and then just like this kind of words that we &apos;re using in the language that we use in the language of the politically correct sprechens .
we know something else is the case .
but we know when we say that , the social narrative are very sensitive to us .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to present things like this in a society that should work .
i want to tell you now what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
after the logic , this self-deception , the willingness to have a different reality that we have in the unconscious knowledge that it &apos;s valid to spread out .
so i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example will predict what many of you know , and some of you appreciate , very few of you , very few of them .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so serious , it says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not stop stofflicher , material nature .
and so , if you have a soul , you know that you have a soul , you know , you have a soul , or you can say , not out of matter , not of matter , you know , just from meat and blood , you know , kind of blood and blood , sort of steinernes , a little bit of steinernes to the earth , verwesbares , verwesbares , unwichtiges , dead .
and of this soul , you think , you somehow think of nature in this wolkigen nature , in this luftigen nature , is called anima , in the latin , der , is present .
and when this lufthauch then lufthauch over the people , he &apos;s filled with dignity , with the spirit , with nature , can just live with soul .
and then he can davonlaufen .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to be coming from outside .
so we should be able to perceive them as something that should necessarily be present to our lives .
and if you have these premise in front , you can understand the logic that &apos;s the logic of the logic that we &apos;re dealing with , through a lie our world .
because now you can apply a dreisatz .
you &apos;re still familiar with school .
this is now a dreisatz that tells us a logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk by the way .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
that you can apply this logic just wrong .
there are three sentences coming three sentences .
the first sentence is klaus claims , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is if klaus right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i pointed out especially here .
a third sentence that immediately shows up with people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
they say who has no soul , who is dead , can &apos;t say anything .
and here you are .
here &apos;s this logic of logic in this , yes , in this täuschenden speech .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logical right .
so i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you about the reality .
i can say the kanzlerin is a man .
and when i &apos;m right , the kanzlerin is a man .
if i don &apos;t have right , it &apos;s not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t worry about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but it &apos;s critical if i &apos;m right , then it &apos;s true .
so when klaus says , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical .
and now our täuschendes mind feels instantly immediately , you can do something .
it depends on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences and it does , as if the first of the first sentence were already proven .
because actually , we have to prove whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic , which is simply using two sentences is correct , and third dazuhängt , which looks like he would have to do with it , so we can save our lebenslüge .
so , we do it as if it wasn &apos;t possible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things in different examples .
in the present , we have a whole modern example , which keeps filling up the tageszeitungen .
so you &apos;ve got to think about another philosophisches , you know , a dauerbrenner from philosophy .
that has to do that we go back to the vierzehnte century century .
there was a scholars that was called johannes buridanus , and after that is named buridansche esel .
the buridansche esel is a esel that consists of pure nature .
it &apos;s not the soul .
this is a naturding .
and if you place this exactly in the middle of the middle of the middle between two gleichgroßen , it verhungert .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a haystack is to go first .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
so the naturdinge introduced .
gleichgroße forces mit forces to solve each other .
there &apos;s nothing at all .
only if you take another example , so if you get a haystack bigger , you don &apos;t need any reason , and you don &apos;t need anything .
he does the right thought .
if you have this idea that you &apos;re in nature , you know , in nature , you &apos;re being driven by the larger pile that you put a straight down , you also quickly have the feeling that there must be something like a free will .
and if we &apos;re already here in frankfurt , then i remember the max-planck-institut of brain research .
there &apos;s a scholars who is called wolf singer , and he says sometimes , sometimes , wolf singer , saying there &apos;s no willensfreiheit .
now we can get back to the second sentence , and we can say when wolf is right , he doesn &apos;t have a willensfreiheit .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can now be able to read at almost every day in this third sentence .
this looks like this , who doesn &apos;t have a willensfreiheit , also , can &apos;t be pulled for his actions , and claims , and he &apos;s so unzurechnungsfähig .
you &apos;ve got it again .
in fact , first you have to prove to see if there &apos;s something like willensfreiheit .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this , as if the first set of the first line is wrong , of course , of course , is to think of the opposite .
and now you can just do anything that you want to do anything , if you want to test anything , and especially when you want to make people happy to make this lüge mut .
practice that , for example , if you meet one person that you can say , there &apos;s no vorhersager .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for vorhersager , which is the prophet .
you cannot call it , that would be a little bit more politically inkorrekt .
tell you , there are no vorhersager .
immediately , you &apos;re going to be one , of course , of course , of course , experience that you can &apos;t prove that .
and already have a problem .
because while you &apos;re engaged in it , you can &apos;t prove that you cannot prove that there is no vorhersager , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he getäuscht her .
because he led them to a fährte that he doesn &apos;t even aufhält themselves .
because actually , this man is not interested in evidence .
it &apos;s only interested in that , in front of the need to prove , to prove that there are vorhersager .
so , in the way the shift of the beweislast , they experience the brilliance of the lie .
and once you have an opportunity once you have a way to feel that dreisatz in other people , you do it , because you &apos;re going to make other people happy if you don &apos;t remember your selbstlüge .
thank you for your attention .
yes , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve been allowed to say if i can mention it .
she &apos;s one of the veranstalterinnen here from this great event , and i asked me if i wanted to give a talk here &apos;s a talk .
i have to say honestly , you &apos;ve got it mitgekriegt , i noticed it was hard to talk about my idea .
and may i think maybe i think i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
but , of course , the sum is , of course , very many ideas .
i &apos;m probably part of these , and i &apos;m part of the two , the generation of this bad girls , which is because i &apos;m part of the generation that i &apos;ve been worried about , because i &apos;ve already begun to study students in karlsruhe , technical college , but today , i think , this is called kit .
and i was then , in the 1980s , for berlin , to berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energy in karlsruhe .
there was the kernforschungsanlage leopoldshafen .
the hießen then hießen all the kfa , also the jülich was called kfa .
the hot today are projektträger .
because a good engineer has either made a great car built or atomkraftanlagen .
but like solarpendel solarpendel , like solarpendel , in some hundred watts , a hundred watts of the square , it was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy ingenieurkollektiv ingenieurkollektiv .
i &apos;m the premium-kola-mensch grateful that he &apos;s got the word back again , because after the mauerfall , you didn &apos;t have to use the word anymore , because everything left was bad .
but that was not that in the achtiziger years .
there was just so that there was selbstverwaltete alternativbetriebe , and one of them was sitting in kreuzberg in mehringhof , where you thought of evil .
but it was called wind and solar power and made wind and solar power , and i started the achtziger .
and yes , a lot of what &apos;s been said today is very much , because many , many , many beautiful expressions that i &apos;ve also lived through .
i worked for 11 years in the collective , which was basisdemokratisch .
we were 20 people .
if a no said , this was the vetoprinzip , it was a völlig , i &apos;ve been able to do it hard for 10 years old , whether i really verschwende a schwachsinnige thing , because all the colleagues of my father &apos;s father , you have zugeredet the window to the window for your child .
it &apos;s so busy .
and this was really , very , very , very , very , very , very bitter , and it &apos;s got a very , very bitter stick , where i asked myself about 10 years , which was a thousand years old , did this , grundlohn , einheitslohn in the collective , of course , whether that it &apos;s supposed to be great .
and i went out to sechsundneunzig ausgehalten , and then we &apos;ve become with friends of the company , which then has become mitbegründer , which was then mit with the spin-off q-cells one of the world &apos;s largest zellenhersteller .
and then , of course , the problem of a growing company , and then we &apos;re going to go back and go back and we think , and we think , and we think , again , it &apos;s the same time again , and again , again , that people say , what &apos;s the quatsch , that &apos;s all the way , we &apos;re talking about store .
and i brought to give you a project that i want you to imagine .
and the title of the talk was , you get a hundred percent renewable .
and we just just started to ask a relatively einfach-verrückten story , where could you have a memory that &apos;s good today .
on this island , this is the island graciosa on the azoren .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there &apos;s four and four thousand people .
now , today , have a renewables of 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have anymore ?
that &apos;s just technological .
if you zubauen more windkraft , the system begins to fail .
i always tell the politicians to tell the politicians when they were in berlin-adlershof our facility .
they always say , why ?
we have 20 percent in germany already .
can &apos;t be a problem at all .
but not , we have seven percent in europe , and our web is the european european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we &apos;d have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , calculate that it was zweitausend2006 , the first contacts started with the island , but just through .
it would have to be large , because it would have to be a battery so that you &apos;re going to be an island in 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe 70 percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;ll go ahead again .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , a year about a hundred gigawatt electric performance on dieselbasis zugebaut in the world .
this is the equivalent of a hundred nuclear power power , very quickly everywhere .
the energiehunger in the world that &apos;s going on , it &apos;s deleted , because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s fast .
you put a box like that .
and then it looks like this .
in which i always run three of the dieseln , two always waited .
yeah , this is the one that &apos;s going on the bottom .
we also have very precise data .
and the windkraftanlage or whatever it is , it &apos;s usually a back-up system of a system , which can only be a system in small amounts here .
our goal was just to say , okay , okay .
and the wind is going to be back-up , and the wind , the sun , they use the burden that they can map the bigger proportion .
and if you want to go through 20 , 30 percent of renewables a year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn off the cds .
that means , at the moment , you have to worry that renewables can basically take the entire net .
and , of course , of course , if you &apos;re managed to be managed in any way .
that hasn &apos;t done anything in the world .
that &apos;s where it &apos;s in the little style , so you can also use your rasierer in your rasierer .
people always ask me , what do you do in adlershof ?
this is all about .
but if you want several of these wechselrichtern zusammenschalten , and they want to build a net , that &apos;s extremely complicated .
and we wanted to be , we wanted to get to 70 to ninety percent , and then the last 10 , last 10 , twenty percent renewable , which is going to become very expensive , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work for batteries .
this is going to be a energy reduction , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas is familiar to gas or sch , that will be the sch .
they then have to go more on a saisonalspeicher and do not only do it .
we just wanted to know what is because of a normal , stinknormalen battery .
how far do you get there at all ?
and then a lot of simulation did .
and they have wind and wind and the last and came to the outcome , a very exciting conclusion that you have to go across to the conventional system , after 20 years , in the middle of 20 years , von from about 50 cents a kilowattstunde , about vierundvierzig cents .
these were the first computations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we are cheaper as much as the diesel-system , if the average five percent per year .
and then we started to negotiate with the insulanern .
what would you have to do ?
have dreamed of investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new gesellschafter .
we were only only five people to rebuild society .
and here &apos;s the representation .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green system , the green system is our system .
that our system also has a preisanstieg , because we &apos;re doing 20 percent of them , and they don &apos;t get a preissteigerung on the other things .
and the power-utility that the elektrizitätsversorgungsunternehmen on the island has meant that we &apos;re great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin where we can sort of build the electrical edge of the island of the island at the scale of the island .
that means we &apos;ve been looking for once to find the greatest battery in the world .
here you are .
it &apos;s naturally from asia , from japan .
and witzigerweise , in the &apos; 70s , in the 1970s , in the bbc mannheim , has been developed now , and then got auslizensiert to the japanese .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has a megawatts of power , and can get six hours for six hours , and this is the battery that we sort of simulationstechnisch simulationstechnisch .
and then they set up .
we also have one of these diesel-aggregate in the same size , which is where it stands into the hall , in fact , which in the hall looks like this now , in the back of the hall , it &apos;s the diesel , here &apos;s the big battery , here &apos;s the whole umrichter that we can simulate the net .
over here , we &apos;re going to simulate all the übertragungsleitungsystem , the kilometer-physik of the cable , to sort of mapping the net .
and you can see that again .
we can also zweihundert kilowatt kilowatt on the net .
here we see this again again again , again , again , that we &apos;ll see , again , again , die .
and what we &apos;ve done since zweitausendneun was the hall , until today , until today , all the way between the single system of electronics that was built in software , we did .
so we &apos;re not batteriehersteller , but we define as a company that is just between the theme of battery and the issue and everything in between .
now , of course , you have to communicate , you can communicate to the net , and that is very complicated .
the beauty of the issue is , in this island , you know , basically , it &apos;s all the vorwegnehmen of problems that we &apos;ll get if we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
so all this discussion , as it &apos;s going to go back and forth , as it &apos;s going to go back and forth , for example , for instance , we have dreißig to 30 percent exzessenergie , we müdsen the wind and the sun .
natürlicht is then smart-grid .
so smart-grid , a riesenthema everywhere .
we can actually start to integrate the island , to integrate elektromobilität , rumzufragen , can you manage the burden .
that means if you &apos;re 70 percent renewable , you will not do that without memory .
you can walk through &apos; n , you can take nets , you can do nets , yes , you should be able to do that in any case , but you will never get rid of memory .
and that &apos;s the n little message .
so , there are many people who are coming up with a lot , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn off the cds , you just don &apos;t have this spinning mass , which causes a certain more inertia of the net .
and our europäisches verbundnetz is essentially just aus masses of large amounts of mass , wherever the wave all around europe around europe .
we look at this web , see 50 hertz , and when it &apos;s going to komma nine hertz , we &apos;re starting to start a couple of ventilchen , again , a little bit of merh steam , then we come back up .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course this is incredibly träge .
if you get that somewhere else , it takes a while .
the spinning reserves has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time they can react to others .
if you don &apos;t have that , this spinning mass , you have to replace it with leistungselektronik and elektrochemie .
and we can see , with this big battery , two milliseconds .
you can see , you know , you &apos;ve already there .
and the message is , we have to go to this rotating masses , 20 , in 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 , 30 , 30 , 30 , 30 , 30 , 30 , 30 , 30 , 30 , 30 , 30 percent , etc .
then we have to break down the net capacity .
must-run is simple , the power station goes to , to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a riesendebatte right now , zubau from the kohlekraftwerken , because we don &apos;t know , or gasturbinen , because that it &apos;s not going .
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that you have the capacity , the must-run capacity , it can break down functional memory into the net .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a lot of studies .
and then to that point , people come up and look at our versuchsstand , sort of our inselteststand .
and yes , the discussion always goes around the question , how far you can get a piece out there .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years , just like the discussion i had over the last 30 years in the last six years .
don &apos;t go , schwachsinn , kinderspielkram , we never come out of anything , don &apos;t count .
we have 30 gigawatt in germany today .
this is vorbildlich .
and i just go from that in the next 30 years , we &apos;re going to be able to store the same capacity in elektrochemischen in the world .
so simple , it will come .
there &apos;s going to be a whole bunch of widerständen and arguments .
the beautiful thing is that i &apos;ve seen in the last two years now , that the scientists on my side .
we have now been able to get over 10 million förderprojekte , and then zehn-megawatt-batterie now to the german web to german .
that &apos;s going to happen in the next april .
so , from that , you can also see that there &apos;s a change that there &apos;s a change , and it &apos;s just from that abwehrhaltung to the idea , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable is true .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a autarkes system .
now , in arguments , they &apos;re always trying to do this , these insulaner , you know , that insulaner , you have a little bit of a little net , which has nothing to do with our verbund .
the question is , really simply , if you &apos;re completely independent by any fossil or uranen energierträgern that will be rausgebohrt anywhere in the world and become hingebracht , you know , you &apos;re an island .
and then they only use the sun and wind and wind there is where they live .
and this is a little bit of a bit of a vernüftigen energy supply , and i also also grateful that they &apos;ve said to use solar power .
and that &apos;s what we do , and that &apos;s what we do , in that way , and the talk , as well as the lecture of kola kola , that you can be able to be a collective energy and use it , it &apos;s a little bit together .
and yes , i want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be quiet a little bit and you can be a vision .
and you really have to be quite zäh , but i think that it &apos;s going .
thank you .
as steve lopez , the los angeles kolumnist of los angeles , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , rau , rau , obdachlos on a violin that only played two strings .
many of you will know the story , because it was a book that was verfilmt , with robert downey junior , as steve lopez and jamie foxx as steve anthony ayers , who kontrabassisten am , who was am at the juilliard-konservatorium , studied , who was finished by robert anthony , was finished early by his paranoide career .
nathaniel left , einen , suffered a nervenzusammenbruch and 30 years later , he lived on the streets of los angeles row in the center of los angeles .
i recommend all of you to read steves book , and to look at the movie , so you have to understand the great connectedness between those two men , but also , like the music of this connection , and how it was ultimately the instrument , when this pun is allowed to get the mithalf , nathaniel , nathaniel away from the street .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney disney hall .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and came out the stage to imagine .
he was talking to a very heiteren note , hillary clinton and hillary clinton , and hillary clinton , like the dodgers could never create in the baseball world series , and all of that because of the tückischen passage of the first violin in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
we &apos;d come to talk to music , and a few days later , i got an email , in which i had was that nathaniel was interested in me .
i have to say even though nathaniel is a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electricity and handschellen and handschellen , a trauma that &apos;s been tracking his entire life .
now , as a result , as a result , it is particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases . they &apos;re so bad , and he disappears for days in the streets of skid row row , always that horror and the folterqualen of his own mind .
and in fact , nathaniel , nathaniel , when we were with our first class in walt disney , the walt disney hall , he had this irre flackern in his eyes , and were completely lost .
he was talking about invisible demons and smoke and about how someone wanted to replace him in their sleep .
i was scared , not meinetwegen , but i was afraid that i could lose him in one of his states , and that i could destroy him his relationship to the violin , when i began to talk about scales and arpeggios and other exciting kinds of formen .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s violinkonzert .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in nathaniels eyes was a complete complete change .
it was as if he was under the impact of an invisible drug , a chemical reaction , whose catalyst was my game .
nathaniels manischer rage turned into understanding , in a calm curiosity and grace .
and as a miracle he took his violin , and he started playing a few clips of violinkonzerten , and then asked me to play them at the end : mendelssohn , tschaikowski , sibelius .
we then started talking about music , starting to talk about beethoven , brahms , bruckner , bruckner and all the other bs , from bartók to esa-pekka salonen .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just have a enzyklopädisches knowledge about music , but with her also a tight personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding of my colleagues in the philharmonie of los angeles of los angeles .
by playing music and talked about music , it was aus , confused man &apos;s man who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , a liebenswerter , gebildeter , ausgezeichneter , ausgezeichneter , in .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
for nathaniel , music is emotional health .
because the music allows him to be thought of his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity and creativity .
and so he entflieht his quälenden conditions .
i understood that exactly this is the nature of art .
this is why we make music , so that we &apos;re doing something in all of us , which is deep inside us , our emotions , our emotions , through our artistic lens , can form our creativity through our creativity .
and the reality of that expression is all about all of us and moved , inspired and vereint us .
what nathaniel designed , it took him back to a community of friends .
the erlösende power of music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood his talent and achtete his talent .
and i &apos;m always going to be with nathaniel music , whether in walt disney disney , disney hall or skid row , because he reminds me of why i &apos;ve become a musician .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i have stolen for unverschämterweise .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i knew a lot of fish in my life .
i only loved two .
this first one , which was more like a passionate affäre .
it was a beautiful fish , wohlschmeckend , good taste , gehaltvoll , a bestseller on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it was gezüchtet in aquakultur after the angeblich highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel like selling him .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
and one day the ceo of the company called the company , and i asked if i could give you an event about sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company that was trying to solve what this unimaginable problem was our cooks is , how do we keep fish on our speisekarten ?
in the last 50 years we have beaten up the ocean as the forests of the ocean .
it &apos;s hard to überbewerten the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the heilbutte , the lachse , schwertfisch , they have collapsed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so i think or übel , fischanbau , part of our future .
there &apos;s a lot of arguments about it . fischzuchtanlagen pollute the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a futterverwertung from 15 to one .
that means , 15 pounds of wildfisch are necessary to get a pound of zucht-thunfisch .
not very sustainable .
doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so , finally , there was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
on the day before the event , i called the head of the öffentlichkeitsarbeit for the company .
let &apos;s call it don .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to grow the facts , you &apos;re famous for to grow as far out in the sea that you don &apos;t verschmutzt the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste is distributed from our fish , not focused . &quot;
and then he added it , &quot; we are basically a world .
this futterverwertung from 2.5 to one , he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what is it feeding ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
and i was in bed that night , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , don .
i said , &quot; don , what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know it . he &apos;s going to know .
well , i telefonierte with a few people in the company , and no one could give me a proper answer to the senior biologists .
we also call it don &apos;t .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
now , he mentioned some algae and some fischmehle , and then he said , hühnchen-pellets .
i said , &quot; hühnchen-pellets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , knochenmehl , reste , reste , getrocknet . &quot;
i said , &quot; how percentage of your futters is chicken chicken chicken ? &quot;
perhaps two percent in the assumption .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable about fish for fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i entliebte myself from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a selbstgerechter genießer and gutmensch .
that i &apos;m even .
no , i actually entliebt from this fish , because , god , i swear to god , who tasted fish after this conversation .
this second fish , which is another kind of love story .
it &apos;s romantic art , the way you know when you &apos;re going to know your fish , you love the fish that you love .
i first ate him in a restaurant first .
a befreundete journalist had spoken about this fish for a long time .
she &apos;s kind of verkuppelt us .
he came on the table with a bright white color .
the chef had him verkocht .
wait twice .
and amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish as well as he was verkocht ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it miguel . actually , he &apos;s miguel .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that you and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
this is a fischaufzucht in the südwestlichen corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentiniern .
they grew up fleischrinder on what were essentially the wetlands .
they did that by entwässerten the land .
they built this complicated episode of channels , and they kept pressing water out of the country and beyond the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t do that , not economically economically .
and ecologically was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds around which a lot of birds are .
and that in 1982 , a spanish company bought the land .
what did they do ? ?
they haben the flow of water .
they literally have the levers .
instead of using the water , they used the channels to hereinzuziehen the water .
they fluteten the canals .
they created a $ 10 acres of fischaufzucht -- barsch , meeräsche , shrimp , shrimp , aal -- and there &apos;s miguel and its company , and its company completely umgekehrt the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
they look out on the horizon that &apos;s a million miles away , and all you see are geflutete channels of channels and these density , lush march .
i was not there at a time before miguel .
it &apos;s an incredible guy , three pieces of charles darwin and a part of charles darwin , &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were and struggling with the wetlands of the wetlands and i keuche and schwitze , i have matsch to my knees , and miguel hält in silence .
here picks up a rare gleitaar .
now he mentioned the mineralbedürfnisse of phytoplankton .
and here , here he sees a pattern of bundle it to the tansanische giraffe giraffe .
it turns out that miguel has spent the largest part of his career national national national national park in africa .
i asked him how to become a fisch-experten .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and falls into more gerede of rare birds and algae and odd wasserpflanzen .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that it was really fascinating , you know , you know , the biotische community , like this .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak over this verkochte piece of fish that i had on the vorabend .
so i cut it . i said , &quot; miguel , how does it taste so good for your fish ? &quot;
he showed the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what eat your fish ?
how is the futterverwertung ? &quot;
now , he continues to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish would eat what they would eat in the wild .
the burning biomass , the phytoplankton , the zoo , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely selbsterneuernd .
there &apos;s no food .
the one a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
later , on this site , i went around on this site , and i said to him , i said , for a place to be , &quot; unlike any farm every farm i &apos;ve ever had , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
in the moment , there was a film director like a director had a film .
and we went around the corner , and we had the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of flamingos , literally the eye &apos;s eye &apos;s eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your bäuche , pink .
they schlemmen . &quot;
schlemmen ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; miguel , don &apos;t you get your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fischeiern in the birds . &quot;
now last year , 600,000 birds were on this site , over 250 different species .
it has become the largest and one of the most important private vogelreservate in europe .
i said , &quot; miguel , is a good gedeihender vogelbestand not the last thing you want to have on a fischaufzucht ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building extensiv , not intense .
this is a ökologisches network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the pinker is the better belly the gut . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that &apos;s not feeding the animals and a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators .
a fischaufzucht , but also a vogelreservat .
oh , and by the way , you should not even be there should be there .
they breed in a city 240 miles , where the bodenbeschaffenheit is better for the nestbau .
every morning they fly 240 miles to farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles .
they do that because they can follow the gestrichelten white line of the landstraße a92 .
seriously . seriously .
i had imagined some kind of the penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , &quot; miguel , fly 240 miles to the farm and will you go back 240 miles back 240 miles back ? &quot;
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me , as though i just quoted a song by whitney houston houston .
he said , &quot; no . they do that because the food is better . &quot;
i mentioned not the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fischhaut . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this beißende , verkohlte taste .
i almost never never do it .
and yet , when i tried it in südspanien , she didn &apos;t tasted nach .
she liked sweet and rein as if you would take a bite off from the ocean .
i mentioned it to miguel and he nickte .
he said , &quot; skin works like a sponge .
she &apos;s the last defense ever before something in the body .
she has evolved over the course of evolution aufzusaugen . &quot;
and then he added it , &quot; but the water is not unreinheiten . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish , a farm that &apos;s measuring their success on their success .
and then i realized if he says , if he says a farm a farm that doesn &apos;t have unreinheiten , he untertreibt , because the water that goes through this farm comes in from the river guadalquivir .
it &apos;s a river that &apos;s going on all of the things that causes all of the things that rivers today tend to lead to themselves , to lead chemical pollutants , flow of schädlingsbekämpfungsmitteln .
and if it &apos;s fought by the system , and this leaves the water is cleaner , as it is hereingekommen .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their own success on the health of their predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a wasser-aufbereitungsanlage , and not just for those fish , but for you and me .
because when the water herausfließt , it versinkt in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this love story , as romantic as romantic , is also aufschlussreich .
you might say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we talk about barsch or fleischrindern .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , of agriculture , where food actually actually taste .
but for many people , this is a little bit radically .
we &apos;re not realisten , we genießer . we &apos;re lover .
we love wochenmärkte . we love little familienbetriebe . we &apos;re talking about regional food . we eat organic food .
and if you say that it &apos;s the things that the future makes you good food is somewhere in and says , &quot; hey people , i love pinke , but how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough calories to feed the world more than only .
one billion people are going to be starving today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of krasser inequalities in the distribution , not the gesamtproduktion .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because you have the logic of our nahrungssystems for the last 50 years .
so feeding on herbivores , schädlingsbekämpfungsmittel on monokulturen , chemicals on the earth , the chicken of fish , and all the time has simply asked the agribusiness : &quot; if we feed more people , how awful it is ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the easy place . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a gewerbe in abwicklung , a craft that &apos;s a schnell ökologisches capital of capital that allows that production .
that &apos;s not agriculture , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
we &apos;re threatened today , not because of abnehmender resources , but because of abnehmender resources .
not by the latest mähdrescher- and traktor-erfindungen , but by fresh water , not by kettensägen , not by kettensägen , not by kettensägen , but by kettensägen , and not by fischerboote and nets , but by fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ? ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that allows every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agrarindustrie-modell for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are obenan , and it never made something really good to eat .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is that for two billion years of arbeitserfahrung zurückgreift zurückgreift .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel , farmers like miguel .
businesses , the ones that are not in worlds for themselves instead of aufzubrauchen , businesses , and businesses , instead , are growing anstatt rather than only , farmers , who are not only erzeuger people who are erzeuger .
because they are the ones who are also experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i will ever be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
so , if i want to show you one thing that the whole of the data that we consume is larger than the sum of their parts , and instead of thinking about informationsüberladung , i want you to think about how we can use information to be able to be able to see patterns , and we see the trends that would be otherwise not visible .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical sterbediagramm at age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pivot , and what i can do with pivot is that i can filter after a specific cause of death , say accidents .
and immediately , i see another pattern that makes you .
and that &apos;s because in the mittelbereich here , people are the most active , and they &apos;re over here .
we can take a step further , and then we get rid of the data and see the usual suspects are the usual suspects , but not everyone .
now , if we move out and sort of age , we say 40 years or younger , we see , accidents even , the main cause is about the cause of being worried about people .
and who can see that is true that this is true in men .
so you realize that this is a lot of information looking at information and data in this way that &apos;s a lot of swimming in a live informationsgrafik .
and if we can do this for raw data why not even for content ?
so what we &apos;ve now got here is the titelbilder of every sport illustrated , who were ever printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can like to test it for my talk in your rooms .
with pivot , they can dive in a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can just jump to a particular issue .
now , if i look here , i see the athlete that appear in this issue and the sportarten .
i &apos;m an lance armstrong fan , so i click this way that i &apos;m going to show up to lance armstrong armstrong .
now , if i just want to get a gröberen overview , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at anything about the topic ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to take a step back and see the view .
now i see greg lemond .
and so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , gezielter , bigger , reinzoomen , rauszoomen , you don &apos;t want to do it or not just surft .
you do something a little bit different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way that information can be used .
i want to do this idea a little bit about what &apos;s crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we took every single wikipediaseite and it &apos;s reduced to a little summary .
the summary contains a short übersicht and a symbol of the area that .
i just show the top 500 of the top wikipediaseiten .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
right now we &apos;ll get a sense of the issues that are on the top of wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the government .
now , after i choose the government &apos; government , i realize that the wikipediakategorien , which is the most of the year magazines .
this is really important because this is a realization that is not in a single wikipediaseite .
it &apos;s just to see when you take a step back and the whole thing .
looking at a certain of the summaries that i can go into a certain of the year &apos;s time , &quot; people &apos; s &quot; des , and all together .
now , when i realize all of these people , i realize that the majority of them are regierungsbeamte . some come out of science , some of them come out of the economy , come out of the economy . here &apos;s my boss , and one comes from the musikbereich .
and interestingly , bono is a prize a prize winner .
so , now we can jump and look at all the ted prize winners .
you see , we &apos;re surfen the first time , as if it &apos;s also a network , not just page , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what else might be a little surprise .
i just show you the new york times here .
pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with it -- and we bring this zoom-technologie to every single website like this .
so i can go back to a step , and just jump directly to a specific sektion .
so that &apos;s why it &apos;s important , because it can just look at websites in this kind of data in this way that can look at all the same way in the same way .
so i can zoom in in a particular place .
here &apos;s the whole demonstration that i was thinking about here .
and i can kind of see everything that i &apos;ve looked at today , again , zurückholen .
and when i take a step back and look at everything , i may be able to reinvent my trajectory , i &apos;ve been looking for &apos; , looking for &apos; , here to bing , or this live labs labs .
and from here , i can go into the page and go to them again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over again , and each time it makes the big picture bigger than the sum of datenteile .
right now , in the world , we think that data is a curse .
we talk about the fluch of the informationsüberflusses .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could turn into the situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of one to go from one to another , people start to go from many things to many things , and using patterns that detect patterns that were otherwise covered in ?
if we can do this , then these past datenfalle , maybe a new source of sinnvoller information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we know , maybe we can actually even pull out of it .
i hear , thank you very much .
i grew up with a gehörigen portion of science fiction .
in my school in my school , i went to school , every day , every day .
and my nose was always stuck in a book , a science-fiction-buch that meine my mind entführte my mind in other worlds and entführte my mind into other worlds , unersättliche curiosity .
and this curiosity showed me that i always , when i was not in high school , when i was not in school , walking around the forests and &quot; samples , &quot; collected frogs and snakes and teichwasser , and looked at everything from the microscope .
i was completely wissenschaftsbegeistert , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and try to explore the limits .
and my love of science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment , because in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that animals and places and places and a world of miracles that we have never imagined before .
and then that &apos;s really good to the science-fiction-rolle gepasst .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint . i could paint .
and since there was no video video games with video games with computergenerierten , all the images in the media environment , i had to create the images in my head .
that we all had to do that at the time . when we read a book , we took the description of the autors , and projected it on the screen in our heads .
my response was to draw on the drawing of aliens , alien worlds , robots , robots , robots , robots and everything .
in the matheunterricht , i was always caught by the teacher , like i was hidden in the middle of the teacher , herummalte .
creativity had to stop it .
and something interesting happened . which is something that was fascinated by jacques cousteaus shows us , the idea of a completely unknown world here on our earth itself .
i certainly would never be able to make an alien world with a spaceship . it seemed quite unlikely .
but here was a world that i actually could enter , here on earth , and she was as fascinating and exotic and exotic like all that i had always imagined when i read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 , i was 15 .
the only problem is that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles from the next ocean .
i didn &apos;t let me take that frustrated .
i nervte my father , until he finally finally had a tauchschule in buffalo , new york , who had done , right on the other side of where we lived .
i did my tauchschein in the middle of the winter in the middle of buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , however , in a real ocean , i had only two years later to face when we moved to california .
since , in the 40 years , they &apos;ve been verstrichen , i spent about 30,000 hours underwater . 500 hours of them in tauchbooten .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flacheren ocean , is as rich as we can really imagine it .
nature doesn &apos;t know the idea of nature , unlike our own , kläglichen human imagination .
until today , i have a deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love to the ocean is the same intensity , with the same intensity ever .
when i aussuchte a profession , it was the filmmaking .
that seemed the best opportunity to tell me to tell stories , to tell stories , with my need to create images .
as a child , i was constantly drawing comic books .
so films were the way , images and stories together . fit together .
of course , the stories that i aussuchte out of , : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; terminator , &quot; and &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
in &quot; abyss , &quot; i could connect my vorliebe for the unterwasserwelt and dive to the filmmaking .
so , both of my two passions .
something interesting happened to &quot; abyss &quot; : to solve a erzählerisches problem in this movie -- and that is , in fact , we had to create a kind of liquid wasserwesen , and we picked up animation , back .
what came out of this was the first computergenerierte soft-surface-figur that ever had to see in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t have a money , in fact , actually played his costs , but i realized something fascinating : the audience all around the world was hypnotisiert from the magic that went out .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , you know , sind technology , you know , you know , is not zauberei technology .
so you saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that must be involved in the filmkunst . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , a lot more .
and together with ilm , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success depended on the effect of this effect .
and it worked . again , we had done something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we have a little bit more comfortable with the film .
from these two experiences , it was a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity .
so , i started a company , with my good friend stan , who was the best make-up- and creature-designer , and she was called &quot; digital domain . &quot;
the basic idea of this company was to jump along the phase of analog processes with visual printers , etc .
and then we did , and we did a competitive advantage for a while .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the creature- and character-design -- which we were actually using the company , in fact , to slow down .
i had written this piece called &quot; avatar , &quot; which should be written in a very new heights of visual effects and expressive effects in a new heights , expressive characters that were made by cg , and the hauptfiguren should be all cg , and the world should be cg .
but the bar hit it quite beautiful , and people in my company told me that we don &apos;t even have to be able to do that .
so i shifted this , and i made this other film about the big ship , untergeht .
i &apos;ve got this as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship &quot; -- it became a liebesfilm epischen scale , a passionate film .
but in the back of the insgeheim , i wanted to actually hinabtauchen the titanic wrack of the titanic .
so i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
i believe you , but i said , &quot; we go to the train . we film the real wrack .
we &apos;re going to show it in the eröffnungssequenz of the movie .
that &apos;s immensely important . it &apos;s a good aufhänger for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but again , it &apos;s going to come back to a reality that &apos;s imagination .
and we then created a reality that , actually , six months later , in a russian tauchboot wiederfand , four kilometers under the surface of the north atlantic , and looked at the real titanic titanic .
this was not a movie , no hd , that was real .
so that really blew me .
and they were enormously enormous . we had to build cameras and the lights and the lights .
and i noticed how much these tiefseetauchgänge , a weltraummission similar .
well , they were also hochtechnisch and bedurften planning .
you get into this capsule , you enter into this dark , you enter this dark , feindselige environment , where no hope is in rescue , if you don &apos;t get back to yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a science-fiction-film .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with exploring the deep world .
anyway , of all of the way to do science and science , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that could not give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine being a creature that we could then create a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the fensters .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermalquellen , and sometimes things i had never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had seen before , and the science at all of the science when we saw them , had no words .
so that &apos;s really umgeworfen me , and i wanted more .
and so i met an unusual decision .
after the success of the titanic , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my hauptberuf as a filmmaker in hollywood on ice on ice for a while for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we were going to be the bismarck , and they were exploring roboterfahrzeugen .
we went to the titanic the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which was a fiberglaskabel abwickelten .
our intention was , hineinzutauchen and the inside of the ship , which never had been done before .
no one had ever explored the inside of the wracks , and you didn &apos;t have any means for it , so we developed the technology .
so , here , i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a tauchboot , and seeing planken , which i think are pretty similar to these brettern , and i know that once the band was played there .
and i &apos;ll fly with a little roboterfahrzeug through the ship .
i actually bediene it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i &apos;m putting it physically within the titanic of the titanic .
this was the surrealste form of a déjà-vu that i &apos;ve ever experienced . because before i take a corner at a corner , i always knew what was going on in the lichtkegel of the vehicle , because i went to months of months when we did the film .
because the set was an accurate copy of the ship .
so that was a very strange experience .
she made me realize that you &apos;re using such a roboterhafte avatare , and so that can be aware of your consciousness in the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
it was really incredibly profound .
and maybe a little view of what might happen in a couple of decades , when you have cyborg-körper to explore something or to do other things , in all kinds of post-humanen zukunftszenarios , which i can imagine .
so after these expeditions , we started to appreciate what we saw down there , really appreciate , for example , for example , for example , of course , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , are sort of alien , but here on earth .
they live with chemosynthese .
they don &apos;t exist in one of the things that we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degree celsius that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also interested in weltraumwissenschaft , and again , again , the science-fiction-einfluss from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space , and they go to russia , they go to russia , go through the mission of the mission of biomedizinische protokoll , and then they fly to the international weltraumstation , and then they &apos;re going to go to the imf and take our 3d-kamerasysteme .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it ran out that i took weltraumwissenschaftler with ourselves in the deep sea .
i took her access to them , and they have access to the world &apos;s access to the world , planetenwissenschaftler , planetenwissenschaftler , people who were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources of looking around and looking around , take samples and use instruments and so on .
we were interested in documentaries , but in fact , in fact , science , in fact , weltraumwissenschaft .
so the circle between my existence as a science-fiction-fan , at the time , as a child , in reality .
over the course of discovery , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but now i &apos;m certainly thinking you can have a director of a director like a schiffskapitän or something .
i didn &apos;t understand much of leadership before i antrat these expeditions .
because at a certain point i had to say , &quot; what do i actually do here ? &quot;
why do i do that ? what comes out ? &quot;
these blöden movies bring us no money .
we &apos;ll just play the cost of the cost of glory .
everybody thinks i was between the titanic avatar and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have gefeilt somewhere on a towel on a towel on a towel .
i &apos;ve done all these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re making it around the task of the challenge , and the ocean is the herausforderndste environment that there is . you &apos;re making it , because of the strange link , and because of the strange link , if a small group of people are forming a team .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people that have worked ununterbrochen for years for years , and sometimes we were two to three months in a row in a row .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is that the most important thing you have is , because you have a problem that you can &apos;t explain anything else .
and it &apos;s going to say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglas , the schallschwächung , and it &apos;s like , &quot; we had to do it the other , you can &apos;t explain the other thing . this is like police officers or soldiers who have been through something in common and know that they can never explain anyone .
there &apos;s a connection that gives each other respect .
so when i came back to turn my next film called &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to apply the same leadership , i tried the same leadership , which is that you respects his team and verdient your respect .
it really changed the dynamic .
and so i stood back with a little team on unbekanntem terrain , and we made &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t have before .
incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we became a richtigen for a four and a half years .
and it changed my way to make movies completely changed .
there were people who said we were doing this ozeanwesen ozeanwesen , and on the planet pandora .
for me , it was more eine way of doing my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we get out of all of this ?
what are we studying ?
i think first is the curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the warning of your team is more important than all the lorbeer of the world .
i come to my young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me an advice i can do . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t schränke yourself .
they have some other people . don &apos;t do it yourself , if they don &apos;t bet themselves . they take risks .
nasa has so lieblingssatz : &quot; fail is not an alternative . &quot;
but in the art , you have to have to be an alternative , because there &apos;s an alternative to it .
no important endeavor , the innovation demanded , was ever addressed .
you have to be ready to take risks .
this is the idea that i &apos;d like to give you to the way , and failure is not an alternative , fear is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and that may surprise something , because my vollzeitbeschäftigung at the foundation , mainly vaccines and seeds , around the things that we have to invent and deliver to the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for those people , even more importantly than any other on the planet .
klimaverschlechterung means that their saaten are not going to grow over many years , we burn too much or too little rain , and things will change as it can &apos;t withstand environment .
that leads to hungersterben . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , climate change is going to be terrible for them .
it &apos;s also very important for them , for them .
the fact is that if you could reduce the price of one thing , the price of energy would be far the most effective .
well , the energiepreis is fallen over time .
it actually is based on energiefortschritten .
the kohlerevolution drove the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in elektrizitätspreis , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , klimaanlagen , we can create modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we cut the price -- let &apos;s cut the price cut -- we &apos;re going to be on a new barrier , and that barrier depends on co2 .
co2 warming the planet , and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they summieren the ausgestoßene co2 , which leads to the temperaturerhöhung , and they have some very negative effects . effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , the indirekte that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt such rapid changes , and thus collapse .
well , the exact relationship between the co2-anstieg and the dadurch temperaturveränderung , and where the other consequences are , there are some questions , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certain ambiguity about how bad these are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i asked the top-wissenschaftler several times , &quot; do we really have to get down to zero ?
isn &apos;t it enough half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will move on .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying , we have a 3.5 foot truck that has to be under a meter of a meter , and then you &apos;re going to put on this .
this has to go down , down to zero .
now , we run a lot of kohlenstoffdioxid , over 26 billion tons .
every american about 20 tons : people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and somehow we have to change changes that lower .
it &apos;s gone up so far .
only different economic changes have been influenced by all , and we need to go from rapidem increases to reducing , and to a reduction to zero .
so this equation has four . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- you want to get towards zero , and that will depend on the number of people , of the service that every person on average is the average energy for every service and the co2 that &apos;s going to be a unit per unit of energy .
so let &apos;s just look at each factor , and think about how we get to zero .
probably one of these numbers needs to come very close to zero .
now this is very basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first we have the population .
today , 6,8 billion people live .
and it goes on to nine billion zu. to move to nine billion .
if we &apos;ve been very successful with new vaccines , the gesundheitsvorsorgung and reproduktionsmedizin , we could reduce it to 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope about 1.3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
this is all the food that we eat , clothing , television , heat .
these are very good things , and armutsverringerung means to make it accessible to all of the planet .
it &apos;s great that it goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to do abstriche and less use , but on average , that number will go up every year , in total , more than double , the number of services are put together per person .
here we see a very basic service . there &apos;s light at home so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and they read their schulaufgaben under the straßenlicht .
now , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , has finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
because of different successes in lichtsektor , through new ways , through new methods , there are many services , their energy energy , some individual services , for 90 percent .
in other of service , like düngemitteln , düngemitteln , 65 00 : 56,000 -- gt -- 00 -- 00 , 00 , 00 , 00 , 00 , or luftverkehr , the resources for improvements in a lot smaller .
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe we get a factor of three or maybe even a factor of three or maybe a factor six .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;re now from 26 billion tons to maybe 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s not enough .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to be a unit of energy per unit .
it turns out that you can &apos;t get that to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
almost every herstellungsmethode for electricity today , it &apos;s co2 in co2 , except renewables .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energiewunder .
now , if i use the word &quot; miracle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the evolution of many of the miracles .
usually there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a particular date .
you &apos;re usually going to be wrong , and some of them are not .
in this case , we need to be vollgas and get a miracle in a very short short time .
well , i asked myself , how can i get that ?
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that the idea of people here ?
i remember last year when i got mosquitoes , and somehow people liked that .
it &apos;s been really tangible for them , you know , that there are people living with mosquitos .
for energy to my energy fell here .
i decided that the out of fireflies would be out of my diesjähriger contribution to the environment .
so here are some natural fireflies .
you have told me that they don &apos;t bite . in fact , in fact , you don &apos;t know the glass .
now , there are all kinds of spielereilösungen like this , but they all don &apos;t get much .
we need solutions , either one or a wide scale and unimaginable verlässlichkeit , and even though there are lots of directions where people are looking for , i really see five who can afford these big demands .
i &apos;ve left fusion , geothermal , fusion and biofuels .
and they might be able to do that , and if i expect it would be great , but my punch line is that we have to work on all of those five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they really appreciate us , because they all have significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there may seem to be simple , but that &apos;s not . you &apos;d have to get all the co2 that comes out of the burning of the schornstein , capture , under pressure verflüssigen , and hope , hoping that it stays there .
there are some pilotprojekte that can do this on a 60 percent -- 80 percent , but it &apos;s going to be in 100 percent of the co2 , and struggle for the lagerung of co2 , is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is lagerzeitfrage .
who will make sure ?
who can make something guarantee , literally , many billion times more than any kind of waste that you can imagine and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a tough problem .
next : nuklearenergie .
it also has three big problems . the cost , particularly in hochregulierten countries , are high for sure that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human engagement , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that may be solvable , and that &apos;s why you should work on .
the last three of the five is me summarized .
it &apos;s the renewables that are called a lot of renewables .
and also , even though it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need any fuel -- you have some disadvantages .
one is the energy density that make these technologies dramatically lower than the kraftwerken .
these are energiefarmen , and you &apos;re talking about many quadratkilometern , 1,000 times more than a normal power station .
they &apos;re also subject to these vents .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all day long , it doesn &apos;t seem to appear every day , and the wind doesn &apos;t go all the time .
so if you depend on these sources of sources , you have to have a way of getting energy in times when it &apos;s not available .
so there &apos;s great preisherausforderungen . there , for example , for example , say , the source of the energy is outside the country is not only the technology , they need to deal with the risk of where comes from different from .
and there are lagerungsproblem .
and to show it , for cars , the computer &apos;s cell phones , cell phones , taschenlampen , for everything , and that &apos;s what i learned with the amount of electronic energy , which is compared to the world , and i found that all the batteries we produce now are producing less than 10 minutes of gesamtenergie .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that &apos;s going to be 100 better than the approaches to time .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you try to get these unterbrochenen sources , we say 20 percent of the rest of the rest .
if you want to rely on 100 percent on it , you need an incredible wunderbatterie .
now , where are we going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
you &apos;re going to say , you &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group there are many who are engaged there .
bill big has several companies , including one called esolar the great solarthermaltechnologien .
vinod khosla invested into dozens companies in dozens of companies to do great things , and i &apos;m trying to support this .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that , perhaps , is to follow the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in nuklearbereich ; modular , modular , liquid .
and the development has stopped in this industry a while ago , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts lying around .
the terrapower-konzept means that instead of the part of the urans , which one percent , the u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , in a long time , we could never simulate whether it would work , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and see that , yes , with the right materialienherangehensweise , it looks like it &apos;s going .
and because you burn that 99 percent , it &apos;s very much better .
in fact , you burn the garbage , and you can even use the waste of today to use these reactors today .
instead of breaking the head , they just burn it . a great thing .
uranium is going to use gradually , a bit like a candle .
you see that there &apos;s a kind of pillar , often , as a wandernde wave of reactor .
that really solves the treibstoffproblem .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned now , so it &apos;s aufgebrauchtes uranium uranium .
the triebe u.s. markets for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re ozeanwasser cheap and just filtriert , you get enough fuel to the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of ideas that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should be successful .
what should our testimony look like ? ?
now , we &apos;re going to go to the goal we have to do , and then we talk about the zwischenschritt .
many people talk about 80 percent reduction in 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent are being produced in the poor countries , and still , hopefully , waldrohdung , and hopefully it will be clean up .
so , to reach that 80 percent , the developed world population , including countries like china , including ihre .
the other note says , whether we use the null-emissionen technology technology , whether it &apos;s in all the developed countries in the developed world , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s super important .
that &apos;s going to be a key key feature .
if we go back from there , what should the evidence look like ?
it should be the two elements again .
we should use the effektivitätsmaßnahmen to get reduction in the way , and the less we emittieren , the less we have , the co2-summe , and also the temperature .
but actually , this note is the things that we &apos;re doing with the things that we don &apos;t have all the big reduktionen , or even less importantly , like the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
we have to follow these breakthroughs with vollgas , and we can measure that , in firmenzahlen , in pilotprojekten and regulierungsänderungen .
there are lots of great books to this issue .
the author al gore , &quot; we have a choice &quot; and david mckays mckays without the air air . &quot;
they &apos;re really going through and creating a framework where this can be discussed in the wide space , because we need all sides of all sides .
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
this is a wish .
a very konkreter wish that we invent this technology .
if i &apos;m just a wish for the next 50 years , i could pick up the president , a vaccine , and i love , or i could choose this desire , which is , halbierter energiepreis without co2 , i would take this wish of a wish .
this has the greatest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this desire , they will be terrible between the long term and the kurzfristig thinking between the united states and china , between the poor and rich , and almost all the lives of that two billion will be much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what are i doing for things ?
we need to use that for more research .
when countries meet places like koppenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t only talk about co2 .
they want to discuss these innovationsstrategie , and they were shocked by den small funds that are spent for these innovative approaches to these innovative approaches .
we need marktanreize , co2 &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; trade .
we need to spread the message .
we need to have dialogue and complete and the things that are being done by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand a little bit better -- first of all -- can you give us an idea of magnitude of these investment ?
bill gates : to run the simulation on a supercomputer , to do all the big scientists , we only need a couple of 10 million , and even if we have tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it works reasonable , it &apos;s only in the 100en million .
the hard step is to build the first reaktors of the first reaktors to find another billion , and the place that actually builds the first of it .
once the first thing is , when he &apos;s going to walk like that , it &apos;s all clear , because the energy economy , the energy density is as different as we know it .
to really understand that , it means building deep into the soil almost like a vertical column , like a column that needed urans , and then starts moving down the process and then works further ?
bg : right . now , you &apos;ve got a lot of people and lots of controls that can go wrong . this thing is where you open it and you hinein- things or herausbringt . that isn &apos;t good .
but if you have a very cheap fuel , you can befüllen it for 60 years -- think of a column -- you &apos;re buried , without the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there , and it &apos;s basically 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
a nuklearreaktor that gives itself a solution to the waste .
bg : yeah . now , what happens to the trash : you can let it sit -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- take you and put it in the next reactor and burn it goes on .
and we start by taking the waste that already exists in these kühlbecken or trockenbehältern in these reactors . that &apos;s our startbrennstoff .
so what &apos;s a problem for these reactors was that what we put in our fill in our fill , and it becomes dramatically reduced in the process of this process .
but while you &apos;ve talked to different people in the world about these possibilities .
where is the greatest interest , so what really do it ?
bg : well we haven &apos;t set up a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting offenlegungsregeln offenlegungsregeln for everything in russia , and there are big interest , and people in russia , india , india , china -- i was here , and i was talking about it , and i &apos;ve talked about how this fits to the energieagenda .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and the japanese have done something in the direction .
this is a variant of a thing that was made .
this is a second step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor , and some countries have this built , so everyone who has a fast reactor , a kandidatat reactor for our first .
in your imagination , there &apos;s zeitrahmen and likely to really go to life ?
bg : well we need one of these skalierbaren , stromgenerierenden things that are very cheap , we have for 20 years to invent and then 20 years .
this is the deadline of the deadline that we &apos;ve demonstrated that we have to follow .
and , you know , terrapower , if everything is good , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could easily keep it .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of companies that , as well as their approaches to work for the drug funds for their pilots to work .
and it would be best if there &apos;s several things , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
see the great potential breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
bg : a energiedurchbruch is the most important thing .
it would be without the umweltherausforderung , but it would have been much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but there are the modular method , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid reaktortyp that seems difficult , but maybe they say that it &apos;s about us .
and so , the beauty of a million times a million times a million times a million times , say , and these are mainly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , is the potential , which is the impact of the country and other things , almost in the own league .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to introduce notfallmaßnahmen to try to keep the erdtemperatur stable ?
bg : if you get too much eaten in this situation , it &apos;s like you have to eat too much and a heart attack , what do you do ? you might need a herzoperation or something .
and it &apos;s called a forschungsrichtung that &apos;s called geoengineering , which is called a different techniques to verzögern warming , so that we would get out 20 or 30 years for us longer .
that &apos;s just a versicherungsmethode .
you hope we don &apos;t need this .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t work on insurance because you don &apos;t even eat it , because you know , because you know that you &apos;re going to save the herzoperation .
i don &apos;t know if this is smart , if you &apos;re smart , if you have a discourse of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have that you should have been able to do that if things go faster , or that innovation needs longer than we expect .
klimaskeptiker : have you one or two sentences for that to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
those who are doing the scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there are negative effects that are going to do with the clouds of things ?
there are very , very few things that you can say at all , you know , in a million .
the hauptproblem here is just like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
and so the investment is , now , if you have all kinds of dringenden problems , which is , in fact , the investment is not the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world , and there are people in the rich world , and they say , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that we should be worried about that uncertainty .
but my dream is that if you can make economic economic , the skeptics also tell me that it &apos;s not a carbon footprint , i wish it was doing that , but i &apos;m going to accept it probably because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous thing . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the björn argument that if you use all of this time and energy to solve the co2 , the armutsverringerung , which is fighting malaria and so on that it &apos;s a dumb waste of resources , it &apos;s money , while there are better things that we can do .
bg : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. 10 billion billion per year than they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
and other things shouldn &apos;t suffer .
you come up to large geldsummen , and you can disagree with sensible people , if you have something that is not economic , and tries to fund that . for me , most of you can be waste .
it &apos;s because it &apos;s very short , very quickly , and we &apos;re going to fund the learning learning . i think we should try to do more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if the abstrich , you can get a very high energiepreis , you can only keep it up .
i mean , any of us here can spend five times so much for our energy without changing their lifestyle .
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even lomborg is thinking .
his new masche now is , &quot; why don &apos;t we talk more ? &quot;
it &apos;s still being associated with its former stories because of his former stories , but he understood that it &apos;s a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why he &apos;s going to do now .
and this is a training that i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little it is going to support .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking to almost all the people here , when i say , i really hope that your wish will be true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a couple of years ago , here at ted , peter skillman a design-wettbewerb called &quot; the marshmallow-herausforderung . &quot;
the idea is quite simple . vierer-teams need to build the biggest freistehende structure with 20 spaghetti , about a meter tape , about a meter of tape , and build a marshmallow .
the marshmallow must be up on top .
and , even though it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s really hard , it &apos;s really hard because people are forcing up very quickly .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned it into a design-workshop .
it was a huge success .
i &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops around the world , with students , developers , and architects , even with ctos , and there &apos;s something about the task of making cooperation in nature , and i want to share some of them with them .
typically , most people start to orient themselves to the task .
you talk about it , you &apos;re thinking about how it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to look like it .
then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization . they &apos;re drawing and lay out spaghetti .
they spend most of their time in zusammenbau structures in the zusammenbau .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have a time , someone &apos;s marshmallow , you get the marshmallow , and you &apos;re putting it gently on the top , you get a step back , you take a step back , and admire your work .
but then , almost always , it &apos;s going to happen that &quot; ta-da &quot; becomes a &quot; uh-oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallows causes that the whole thing and einstürzt the whole thing .
there &apos;s a series of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh &quot; than others , and under the worst are fresh frische .
they &apos;re going to cheat , they &apos;re confused , and they &apos;re producing dürftige shapes .
and of course , there are teams who have a lot more &quot; ta-da &quot; ta-da &quot; ta-da &quot; and under the best absolventen .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , they don &apos;t only produce the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking : how is that ? why ? what about those ?
and peter tells me , &quot; none of the kids spend time in the head of spaghetti gmbh . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in machtkämpfe .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that bwl-studenten were trained to find a real plan , ok !
and then to realize it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time more and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what kindergartenkinder do is that they start building the marshmallow and build prototypes , the successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that they have the opportunity to repair baufällige prototypes .
konstrukteure recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of a iterativen vorgangs .
and with every trial , the children will get directly feedback what works and not .
so , working to work , working with prototypes , but we can see how different teams act .
most of the average is about 50cm , for most of them , they create half of them , lawyers do something more , but not much , kindergartenkinder are better than adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
three feet is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and sich-selbst-verstärkende geometric patterns are the key to build cooperative structures .
ceos are a bit about average , but it &apos;s going to be interesting .
you put an administrator on the team , you become significant better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see , you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is this ?
because they have special attributes of prozessbegleitung .
they lead the process , they understand it .
and that team that regelt down and on the work is going to look at the performance of the team significantly better .
specialized skills and prozessfähigkeiten and their kombination lead to success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical thing , you get about 6 , the stable structures .
i tried something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s take the pokereinsatz .
so i offered a $ 10000 prize to software for the winner .
what happened to this design-studenten ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if someone does anyone have built high construction construction , he would have made the prize .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high levels have a strong effect ?
we repeated this practice with the same students .
what happened now ?
now they understand the advantage of prototyping .
so for the same , bad team one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there are tief-greifende lessons for us , about nature &apos;s action and success .
you might ask : why would someone actually invest time to create a marshmallow-challenge ?
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help to help , cars , video games and &quot; visual effects . &quot;
and what the marshmallow-challenge does is , it helps them identify hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a shared experience , a common language , the actual prototype of building the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in this can be marshmallowchallenge.com .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the marshmallows .
there &apos;s a schritt-für-schritt-anleitung there .
you find crazy examples of all around the world , like people optimize and raffinieren .
there are also weltrekorde .
and the most exciting lesson i think is construction is actually a verbindender sport .
it requires that we all set our senses on the task , and we think that we think that we think of how our emotions and our thinking we do , in the challenge , in front of us .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience of all that it needs to make us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
if we would have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room needs to go in .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and right now .
and i wonder what you would choose because i &apos;ve been asking my friends recently , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america &apos;s addiction to the superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i believe you &apos;re sort of drawn to wunschdenken .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a abenteurer .
it &apos;s because opportunities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that there was ever on the planet , no matter what scale you have : health , wealth , wealth , mobility , declining krankheitsraten .
there was never a time like this .
my ur-großeltern died when they were 60 .
my grandparents introduced this number to 70. .
my parents are the 80 to the fersen .
so there should be better a nine at the beginning of my todeszahl .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child that can be born in new delhi today , as long as the richest man of the world , is 100 years ago .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox , smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they have neu the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we bezwungen them . puff .
in the rich world there are diseases that millions of us have been threatened by only one generation , barely threatened .
diphterie , röteln , kinderlähmung ... ...
does anybody know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are the successes of the scientific method .
and from my perspective , the scientific method is to try to see if it works , if it doesn &apos;t work , if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned often .
and one of them is that despite all our achievements , one billion people on this planet are going to go to bed every day .
and it goes up very quickly , and it &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to verwüsten this world .
drinking water , urbares country , rainforests , oil , gas , gas : you &apos;re going to disappear , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos of chaos .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think ?
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country they live on .
i think we can supply this world with energy that they don &apos;t even destroy .
i think that really , and no , that &apos;s not a wunschdenken .
but that &apos;s holding me awake at night -- one of the things that i keep holding awake at night . we have never been as much as using scientific progress .
and we &apos;ve never been able to do it as well as we can do it today .
we are on the verge of amazing , amazing events in many places , and yet i really think that we have to go back 300 years ago , 300 years before the enlightenment , to find a time where we have progress where we &apos;ve got to fight about these things more fronten than now .
people are putting themselves in their faith , so tightly that they can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth will free .
and listen , everybody has a right to his opinion . even in his opinion .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t have right to their own facts . &apos; tschuldigung , they don &apos;t have .
and i took a while to figure that out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccines for the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed by hitting resistance , in resistance , which at the end of the most effective activity in health care is in human health .
i didn &apos;t know what i should do , so i just did whatever i do , i wrote an article and i went on .
and soon after this , i wrote an article about genetically transformed food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people played crazy .
so i also wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why they believed that molecules were in a particular kind of random art kind of herumzuschieben auf in the area of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept doing .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re rich , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but this article worried me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these fanatiker who were crazy , they were keine me at all .
these were umsichtige people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that brought me so confused .
but then i thought , you know what we &apos;re honest .
we &apos;re at one point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as used to .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking about this , with small quotes : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons for this , and i think we know what these are .
we have trust in institutions , authority , and sometimes in science in itself , and there &apos;s no reason why it should not be .
you can just call a couple of names and people will understand .
chernobyl , bhopal , the challenger , mass destruction , mass destruction , 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we thought they were always right . be skeptical .
ask you , ask the evidence , demand the evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
but here &apos;s it : if you get the evidence that you need to take that evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can say that from the reason that we &apos;re living in an epidemic of fear , as i never saw it , and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that autismus-epidemie autismus-epidemie with the measles , mumps , and röteln vaccine .
very scary .
lots of studies were done to see if that was true .
lots of studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious matter .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , none .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we see , what causes us to see what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a bündel of documents from a regierungsangstellten that &apos;s data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that was devastating .
catastrophic katastrophal of this : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the impfrate are falling down for measles .
that &apos;s skandalös , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happens is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do that .
because anybody get measles here ?
have one in the audience ever in the audience ever , to see anybody dying ?
not very often .
don &apos;t happen in this country at all the time , but 160.000 in the world in the last year .
these are many deaths by measles , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not what happened , we can in denial , and people like jenny can mccarthy around and get messages from fear and analphabetismus of platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and they can do that because they can &apos;t connect the cause and correlation .
you don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same thing .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he befreite us from one of the worst geißeln of humanity .
no fear , no qualen , kinderlähmung , puff , disappeared .
the guy in the middle , not so much .
he &apos;s called paul offit .
he has just developed a few other people with a rotavirus-impfstoff .
he can save the lives of 400- , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , that &apos;s good , besides that paul runs around and vaccines talk about vaccines and says how valuable you are , and people should just stop jammern .
and it actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul speaks to paul in a public anhörung , he cannot say without arms wächter .
he gets phone calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where their children go to school .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
so , if you , you &apos;re going to return to the diseases of the diseases , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening right now .
we &apos;ve got measles in this country now .
and that &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon children will die again , because that &apos;s just one question of numbers .
and they won &apos;t just die of measles .
what about kinderlähmung ? take this . why not ?
a kommilitonin of mine wrote me a couple of weeks ago , and i said she &apos;s a little bit to be schrill .
nobody said that said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t want to vaccinate your child kinderlähmung . no case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have kinderlähmung . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have kinderlähmung in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t know , maybe anyone in lagos in lagos in an airplane , and flies just to los angeles , right now , about ohio .
and in a few hours , he goes and mietet a car , and he &apos;s going to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these fantastichen ted-dinner tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a lähmenden disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works .
this is the planet that we live on . it &apos;s not as if it &apos;s not .
we love to hüllen ourselves . we love that .
do you all have their vitamins tomorrow ?
echinacea , a little antioxidantium that helps you to do that .
i know you &apos;ve done this because half of americans do it every day .
they take that stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data is all the time .
they make their urine . they &apos;re almost never doing it .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with you .
dark urine . dark . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do this ?
now , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s completely cold and seelentötend itself to us who can afford it .
so we &apos;re walking away , and where are we going ?
we &apos;re running into the arms of placebo-industrie .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo-industrie .
but you know , this is really serious stuff , because that stuff is crap , and we spend billions of it .
and i have all kinds of little requisiten here .
none of them -- gingko , fraud , betrug , acai , i don &apos;t even know what this is , but we spend billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s cheating .
and you know what ? if i say that , people scream me and say , &quot; what do you care ? let people do what they want .
so you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether it &apos;s gesundheitsminister , he says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to mammogram the evidence of my experts , &quot; or any sort of krebs-quacksalber who wants to treat his patients with kaffe-einläufen .
if you &apos;re moving on this way , where believe and magic can replace evidence and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
and he took 400,000 of his people , because he insisted that red beete , knoblauch and zitronenöl , much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that you can get the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of unnötiger deaths in a country that gets worse than any other from this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things have consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the hirnloseste epidemic epidemic that we &apos;re in is this absurde struggle between the befürwortern genetically engineered food and the bio-elite .
this is a idiotische debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , in metaphors .
that &apos;s ideology , not science .
everything that we eat , every branch , every branch , every branch , has been changed by the people .
you know , there was no mandarinen in paradise .
there were no cantaloupe-melonen .
there was no weihnachtsbäume . we &apos;ve done it all .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them have worked and some of it doesn &apos;t work .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can make it closer . and of course , of course , there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people .
they don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we lehnen nahrung food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , hormones , monokultur , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yeah , they &apos;re right . we fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge nahrungsproblem , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , patentkram .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes he does not work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do to do their work , because we fear that we have a sackgasse , and it holds millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years we will have to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? genetically engineered food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this kind of verrottete stuff like maniok .
maniok is something that &apos;s going to eat half a billion people .
it &apos;s like a potato .
it &apos;s just a ton of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it has no protein , and scientists are building all this right now .
and then people could eat the food , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
you wouldn &apos;t starve , you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be chez , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say to this is : why do we fight that ?
i mean , we ask : why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to herumschieben genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our beharren of food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice krispies , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , as we do so far as we do , we do something guilty about what we do , i think , don &apos;t want to be guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description of what happens here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s our not worthy , it &apos;s our not worthy , and we really have to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might say , &quot; do you want to say to this ridiculous time time , and go to the future ? &quot;
anyway , that &apos;s what i want to do .
right now , they &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time time on everything we want .
we can hinbewegen them where we want to hinbewegen them , and we will move them to where we want .
we need to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go up to time time , and go to the future we &apos;ll be happy to have done that .
i know that we can , and as far as it is to me , what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo-effekt . it might be strange that a magician might be interested in this , because , you know , you &apos;re looking at it as i said , &quot; a delusion that will be real , if someone &apos;s really believes in it . &quot;
so in some studies , a measurable effect in some studies have shown a measurable effect , which is a measurable effect , or a kind of -- in the schmerzmanagement , for example , if the patient doesn &apos;t believe it , is a measurable impact in the body , which is called a measurable effect in the body .
a deception gets true to something , because someone perceives it .
so , we also just want to understand each other , i want to show you a very simple trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has at least since the 1950s is standing in every zauberbuch for children .
i myself gelernt him from the cub magic magic magic magic magic magic magic .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and explain it .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife that you can study is , my hand , that you can study .
i &apos;ll just hold the knife in my hand .
i push my sleeve back .
and to make sure nothing in my sleeve disappears or away from him , i &apos;ll just get my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see no time at any time , as long as i &apos;m here , there &apos;s nothing to my sleeve or come out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open up my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will hold it through my bare physical .
in fact , in fact , in the place that i can shake it without the knife .
nothing goes into my sleeve or coming out , no trickserei . and you can study everything .
ta-da !
well , that &apos;s a trick that i &apos;m often interested in little kids who are interested in magic , because you can actually learn a lot about deception when you look closer , even though it &apos;s a very simple auszuführender trick .
now many of you probably know this in the room is this trick .
it works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say that i &apos;m umschließe my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or coming out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m handgelenk my wrist is that the real secret is the illusion of illusion .
because in the moment , i mean , you see , in the back of you , you see , you &apos;re going to see them in the back of the back of this , my finger , just from there , just from where he was , in a position that it &apos;s extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody sitting there who &apos;s not a childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and if i umdrehe myself , the fingers changes its position .
and now you might talk about why you don &apos;t realize that there are only three fingers on the bottom of the mind , because the mind and the way he processed information , it &apos;s not individually counts , one , one , two , three , but it looks as a group .
but that &apos;s not what we &apos;re doing now . and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s recorded , of course , but not through the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my zeigefinger , which is now .
and when i close my hand , what happens is the same thing that happens in the same thing that i &apos;m putting out of this movement , that the fingers is coming back again .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
you can do this trick your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo-effekt ?
one year ago , i read a study that really blew my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or scientists , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing for me .
and what it turns out is , if you offer a placebo placebo to a white pill in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a specific effect .
but if you give the shape that you will bring that placebo to a smaller pill , for example , change a smaller pill , and you color that blue is actually , it &apos;s actually measurable .
and that , although none of them are pharmazeutische -- it &apos;s just zuckerpillen .
but one white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really made me freak out .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not anything yet .
if you take capsules , it &apos;s more effective than any form of pills .
a colored capsule that &apos;s yellow at one end , and in the red ist is better than a white capsule .
the dosage plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact way . sorry .
but the key thing is ...
that also play a role playing a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo-effekt , you have to reach into a needle .
right ? a syringe with a wirkungslosen -- some milliliter substance that you injected into a patient .
it creates a very strong image in your head . it &apos;s much stronger than a white pill .
this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time if we have a regime .
so the fact is that the white pill is not as good as the blue pill , which is not as good as a capsule , which is not as good as good as the needle .
and none of it has any really pharmazeutische property . it &apos;s just our belief in which we make a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let it look real .
we know from the study that you have to reach the needle if it should go to a needle .
this is a 18 hutnadel , and it &apos;s a very , very , very , very spitz . and i &apos;m going to do a little bit sterilisieren .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not damians special meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect in hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin , and go through it until she austritt it back on the other side .
if you &apos;re evil , if you fall übel -- if you get a little bit of ohnmacht -- i &apos;ve demonstrated that a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and this has become almost ohnmächtig .
so i propose , if you &apos;re going to evil , you &apos;ll look at the next 30 seconds , and you know what , you know , i &apos;m going to do the first sensitive part here .
you can see it in the same , but you can also see wegsehen if you want .
so , it &apos;s like this , where my meat starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to do a little einstich .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you do that crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin , and on the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had beim .
about it .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see this .
they say , &quot; okay , this is not so dumb and durchsticht itself , just to talk for a few minutes . &quot;
now , i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people in the back say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this right .
people in the nebenräumen are coming in now .
let me show you from close to me .
that &apos;s really my skin . that &apos;s not a special effect in hollywood .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can do it .
sorry . if you &apos;re going to übel , look away , look away , don &apos;t look .
and that back in the back , you &apos;ll see , at some point , you &apos;ll be saying , &quot; well , this looks pretty impressive , but if it &apos;s real , he would see -- you see , here &apos;s a hole and there if it &apos;s really real , it would bleed . &quot;
okay , let me give you a little blood for you .
yes , here it is .
i usually would take the needle out .
i would clean my arm and show you that there &apos;s no lesions .
but i think , in this context , and with the intention of making a real thing out of a deception , i &apos;ll just leave the needle in there and go from the stage .
we &apos;ll have a couple of times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;ll be excited about it . thank you .
everyone is talking about happiness today .
i have some people who have been published the number of books that were published with happiness in the last five years , and they gave up about 40 years , and there was a lot more .
there is a massive wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of glücks-coaching .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all this tide of work , there are several cognitive fallen , there are several cognitive falling , which sort of can do almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly going to be of these cognitive fallen .
it &apos;s true for laien that are thinking about happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that &apos;s exactly as mess as everybody else .
the first of those fallen is a widerstreben , komplexität complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful word , because we &apos;re applying it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we could narrow it on , but in the big and large , this is something that we need to give up , and we will take the complicated perspective , which is what well-being is .
the second case is a case of life and memory : it &apos;s basically a happy story between his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both zusammengeworfen in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the konzentrations-illusion , and that is the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affects well-being without its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a frage-und-antwort-sitzung in one of my lectures . &#91; unclear ... &#93; he said he had a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music music , and at the end of the recording , there was a fürchterliches kreischendes sound .
and then he added it , really quite emotional , which has been ruined all the experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it was ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had a herrlicher music for 20 minutes .
they don &apos;t count because he was with a memory of memory , which was memory , which was memory was ruined , and that was everything he had to get .
what this really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and thinking about other people in the sense of self .
there &apos;s a erlebendes self that lives in the present and knows the present , able to experience the past , but basically the present time .
it &apos;s the erlebende self that the doctor anpricht -- you know , you know , if the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt you ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a erinnerndes self , and the erinnernde self is that the mitzählt and the story of our life gets up , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor will argue by saying , &quot; how did you feel lately lately ? &quot;
or , &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot;
these are two very different units , the erlebende self and the erinnernde self , and the beiden part is part of the durcheinanders of happiness .
well , the erinnernde self is a storyteller .
and this is really starting with a fundamental response to our memories -- it &apos;s beginning to do .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we &apos;re doing to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we have to talk about our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are actual patients who put themselves in a painful painful .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who of two has suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
the patient b has clearly suffered . his darmspiegelung was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a had had the patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how really did these patients think they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient a much lower patient had a much worse erinnrung to the patient b. the patient b.
the stories of the darmspiegelungen were different , and because it &apos;s a very important part of the story .
and none of these stories is very erbaulich or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is far worse than the other .
and the one that &apos;s worse was where the pain was at the end of its peak , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people about their darmspiegelung , and too much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing overall ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than b in erinnrung .
now , this is a direct conflict between the erlebenden self and the erinnernden itself .
in terms of view , b clearly had a worse time .
now , what you could do with the patient a make , and we actually did clinical trials , and it &apos;s been made , and it works , in fact , actually , in fact , in fact , to give the patient a little bit of the patient , and just to shake up the tube without driving too much .
that will lead to the patient suffering , but only a little less than it was before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you know , the erlebende itself is worse on the patient &apos;s worse , and it makes you have the erinnernde itself a much better off , because now you gave patients a better story about his experience .
so what draws a story ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that provides us and it &apos;s true for the stories that we invent .
so this is a story wodurch , meaningful moments and ends .
end up , very , very important , and in this case , the end of the end .
well , the erlebende self lives continuously alive .
it &apos;s got moments of erlebens , one after the other .
and you ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our life -- you know , you know , most of the moments of our life -- you know , the psychological presence is about three seconds , you know , you know that there &apos;s about 600 million of them , in a month , there &apos;s about 600,000 million of them , and most of them have no trace behind .
most of them are completely ignored by the erinnernden self .
and yet , you get the impression that you should count , that , during these moments moments , our life is happening .
it &apos;s a limited resource that we use while we &apos;re in the world .
and as we use them , we would seem to be important , but this is not the story that holds the erinnernde itself for us .
so we have the erinnernde self and the erlebende itself , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is about time .
from the point of view , if you have a vacation , and the second week is as good as the first one , then the zweiwöchige vacation vacation is twice as good as the einwöchige vacation .
so that doesn &apos;t work at all the time .
for the erinnernde self , a zweiwöchiger vacation is barely better than the einwöchige vacation , because there are no new memories added .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , the critical variable , actually , in fact , the critical variable , which is different from a erlebenden self . time has very little influence on this story .
now , the erinnernde self makes more to remember and telling stories .
in fact , when you have a patient who , you know , if you have a patient , we &apos;d say two different surgeons at the time , and decides what he should choose , then the person who has the memory that has the memory that is less bad and that &apos;s the surgeon who will be selected .
the erlebende self has no voice in this choice .
we actually don &apos;t choose between experiences . we choose to choose between memories of experiences in experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as a experiences .
we think about our future as a vorausgesehene memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the erinnernden self , and you can think of the erinnernde itself as one that sort of sozusagen the erlebende self through experiences that doesn &apos;t need the erlebende .
i have the impression that if we &apos;re a holiday that &apos;s very often the case , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing on vacation in the service of the erinnernden itself .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how do we zehren our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s given to the dominance of the erinnernden itself .
and when i think about this , i think about a holiday that we did a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best holidays i &apos;ve ever had , and i think relatively often about how often i think of other urlaube .
and i &apos;ve probably got that from my memories of this dreiwöchige journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i would have ever spent the folder with 600 pictures that i would have spent another hour .
now , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s about a half and a half hours .
there seems to be a disagreement .
now , i may be a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have to do with memories of memories , but even if you do more of it , there are a real question , why do we give memory so much weight on the weight of the weight we have ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the urlaubs , all your images will be wiped , and you get a amnestisches drug , so you &apos;re going to remember nothing .
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you would choose a holiday between , there &apos;s a conflict between the self , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think about time , you get an answer , and if you think of your memories , you could get a different answer .
why we choose to pick up the urlaube , which is a problem that we choose to choose with a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self throwing two terms of the self .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one itself .
so you can ask : how happy is the erlebende self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are moments in the lives of the erlebenden self ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a rather complicated process .
which is the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re now able to have a pretty good idea to get a really good idea of happiness about time .
if you ask the happiness of the erinnernden self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this isn &apos;t about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or happy the person is thinking about your life .
very different term .
anybody who &apos;s not going to distinguish these terms of happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers on the well-being of well-being that have exploration of happiness in the same way .
the distinction between the happiness of the erlebenden self and the satisfaction of erinnernden itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now you try to measure the two separat .
the gallup organization has a survey where more than half a million people have been asking questions about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started learning about happiness in the two ways of self .
and the main lesson that we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy people are with his life , and that doesn &apos;t teach them much about how happy he lives his life and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of a correlation , the correlation is about .5 .
what that means is that if you were to meet someone and you would say , oh , his father is a zwei-meter-mann , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone life as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty on how happy he is with his erlebenden self .
so connection is low .
we know something about what the happiness happiness determines .
we know that money is very important , targets are very important .
we know happiness is mostly happy to be satisfied with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the very fortunate of the self , they will do very different things .
the implication of what i &apos;ve said here is that we should really not imagine happiness than a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very quickly , another reason that we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life , and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not getting the correct answer .
if you ask this question , you think that people have to be happier in california if they say , in ohio , in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , say , climate .
now , it turns out climate is not very important for erlebende itself , and it &apos;s not even very important for the nachdenkliche self , which decides how happy people are .
now , because the nachdenkliche itself is responsible , you can at the end -- some people could pull out to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to people who are moving to the hope to be happier .
well , your erlebendes self will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because when they &apos;re thinking about it , they &apos;re going to be reminded of how terrible weather was in ohio , and they will feel that they &apos;ve made the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think clearly about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question to you .
thank you .
now , when we went on the phone , a couple of weeks ago , they talked to me that there was a pretty interesting conclusion that came from this gallup poll .
is that something that you can share with us , because you have now a few minutes left ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
i think the most interesting thing that we found in the gallup survey is a number that we have absolutely not anticipated .
and we found that in terms of the happiness itself .
when we looked at how emotions vary with income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under 2,000 dollars a year , under 600,000 dollars .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year is people unhappy , and they become increasingly less unhappy , the poorer they will .
we get an absolutely flat line about this .
i mean , i &apos;m rarely seen as flat lines .
what happens is , obviously , that money was not leaving a erlebnis-glück , but lack of money on a lack of money , and we can measure this miserable very , very clearly .
in the other sense of the other self , the erinnernden self , you get a different story .
the more money you deserve to be happier .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , all the american endeavor , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
and when people take these befund seriously , i mean , it seems to be able to put everything on the head , everything we believe in , for example , for example , and so on .
is there a chance of politicians that politicians , generally , would take a befund , and do it based on politics ?
dk : you know , i think there &apos;s an tribute to the role of glücksforschung in politics .
it &apos;s going to be slow to the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening in other countries right now .
people are aware of happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to explore erlebnis-glück , or do they want to study lebens-bewertung , so we have to have this discussion pretty soon .
how to increase happiness can be very different depending on how you think and whether you think about the erinnernde itself , or whether you think about the erlebende self .
that will affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
in the united states , you strengt to measure the erlebnis-glück of the population .
this is going to be , i think , in the next one or two decades of national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this topic , or at least , at least the most interesting political debate for the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny kahneman .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design computer games .
i &apos;ve been developing now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to be easily able to save the world in reality , as it is to save in online-spielen .
i have a plan . i want to convince more people , including all of them , spend more time playing with play with play and tollerer games .
we &apos;re currently spending three billion hours a week with online-spielen .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe a little too much time when you think about how many problems we desperately have in the real world .
but in fact , in fact , in my research at the institute of the institute , according to the future , is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the world &apos;s problems .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to dramatically increase that time .
i calculate that it &apos;s time for 21 billion hours just a week .
it seems to be a little bit more abwegig , so again , if we have problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global climate change , global conflict , i think , we have to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours per week of the next decade .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture is pretty much why i think games are so critical for survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographers toledano toledano .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play . so he has built a camera in the players .
this is one of the classic expressions playing .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe you can see some of the nuances in this picture .
you &apos;re probably seeing this sense of urgency , something fear , but also äußerste concentration , so deep into solving a real difficult problem .
as you also play , if you &apos;re playing games , you see , in the upper gezogenen eyes , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player that &apos;s on the edge of a sogenannten called epischen sieges .
oh , you know this . ok . so , we have some players here .
a epischer victory is a result that &apos;s so strong positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if they do it , they &apos;re shocked to actually be able to do something like that . this is a epischer victory victory .
this player is just a epischen victory .
and this is what we have to see on millions of faces from problemlösern across the world , if we take the barriers in the other of the next century , the face of those who entgegen against the edge of the eines of a epischen sieges .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re going to see this face in real life , when we face difficult problems .
i call it the &quot; in life i am bad . and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s me , as i am in life , i &apos;m bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home at berkeley , california , where i was doing in my ph.d. why we &apos;re better in games than in the real life .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good in the reality as we play .
and i don &apos;t mean not just successful , even though that way .
we get into spielwelten . i mean , i mean , the motivation with motivation , inspired with motivation , inspired with each other .
if we &apos;re in a spielwelt , i think a lot of us turn into our best version , any time and immediately , to try to solve the problem as long as you need to try to try and try it again .
and in reality , if we collide when we run on obstacles , we feel very different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel threatened . we feel threatened , we feel threatened , frustrated , frustrated or zynisch or zynisch .
we never have these feelings if we play games , they just don &apos;t exist .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to look at as a student .
why is it impossible to think , you could do not just reach everything ?
how can we transmit these feelings into reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft that offers the ideal environment to collaborative .
and i &apos;ve found some things that will make the epic siege possible in online-welten .
so first , when you get into one of these online-spiele , especially in the world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters who are willing to anzuvertrauen you , a weltrettende mission anzuvertrauen , right now .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to her current level in the game , right ?
so they create this .
they never get a challenge you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of your skills , you have to work . but there are no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around , and you &apos;re dreht . there &apos;s always a specific thing to do .
and there are plenty of employees .
you &apos;re going to go to hundreds of thousands of people working with them to end up on their epic mission .
that we don &apos;t have that easy in the real life , that feeling that in a fingerschnipsen rich employees are willing to be ready .
and then there &apos;s this epic story , these inspirational history , these inspirational history , why we are and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve been inspired by level , and &quot; + a power &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
that constant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in real life .
and when i leave this stage , i don &apos;t say , + 1 + a crazy idea , + 20 crazy ideas .
i don &apos;t get in the real life of this feedback .
so , the problem of kooperations-online-welten as world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be on the edge of a epischen sieges , that we &apos;d rather spend our time in these spielwelten .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
until today , all the world of warcraft-spieler have spent 5,93 millions of years trying to solve virtual problems .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it sounds übel .
but just to look at the context of the context : 5,93 million years ago , our first primatenvorfahren began to go upright .
so the first aufrechte primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we &apos;re going to play with play at the moment , it makes that sense , in terms of the order of magnitude of human development , what is extraordinary .
but appropriate . because it turns out we &apos;re using all of these time to play , actually change what we are able to do as humans .
we &apos;re developing as well as collaborative thinking .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe .
look at this interesting statistic , which recently came from a researcher who was published by carnegie mellon university , the average young man , the average young person in a country that &apos;s had 10,000 hours to spend 10,000 hours with online-spielen until 21 .
so 10,000 hours is an incredibly interesting number of two reasons .
first , for kids in the united states , 10.080 hours in the united states are the exact gesamtzeit that they spend in school , from the fifth grade high school , if you don &apos;t have to .
so we &apos;ve got a full of parallelbildungsweg , in the young people as learning what it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; überflieger , &quot; read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of the 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research in kognitivwissenschaft , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the mühsamen study of any subject to the 21st year of age , we &apos;re going to address it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at whatever it is to do , like the most significant people in the world .
so what we have here is a full generation of young people who are meister-spieler .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players doing meisterhaft ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we &apos;d never have the potential to have the potential for the potential .
so many people are currently in the world at least one hour per day .
these are our meister-spieler . 500 million people who are very good in &quot; something &quot; .
and in the next decade , we have another billion players that are very good in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the spieleindustrie developed konsolen to save energy and work on mobilfunknetzen , instead of breitband-internet , so that players , in particular , around the world , especially in india , china , brazil to play online .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started to think about what it is , what these games are doing .
here are the four things that i found . first , dringlichkeits-optimismus .
ok , imagine how extreme selbstmotivierung .
dringlichkeits-optimismus is the desire to do something immediately , a hurdle , together with believing that we have an early hope for success .
players always believe that a epischer victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to try and do it .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in the spiders of social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show that we might like people , after we played übel with them , even if they &apos;ve defeated uns .
the reason for that is that there requires a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
we trust that somebody has spent a time with us to spend the rules that the rules that are going to be the same goal and to the spielende .
so , the zusammenspielen enables the ties to grow , trust and trust .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
glückselige productivity . fantastic ! !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the durchschnitts-word of warcraft-spieler 22 hours per week is playing as a teilzeitjob .
the reason is that if we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work happier than if we &apos;re going to relax or not .
we know that as human beings work , we actually work as human beings do hard to do hard work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right job .
and finally , epic meaning .
players like it to become part of awe of missionen missions .
here &apos;s a hintergrundinformation to go back to the right light , and you all know wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
the second wiki in the world , with almost 80,000 einträgen , is the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about world of warcraft in the internet than anything else in every other wiki in the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these superpowers are four superpowers who lead to a single outcome . players , hopeful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is they think they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real thing .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward castronova is a volkswissenschaftler .
his work is brilliant . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in online-welten .
and he says , &quot; we are zeugen from not less than a massenemigration in virtual worlds and online-spielumgebungen . &quot;
and that &apos;s an economist . so it makes sense .
and he says ...
not as i do -- i &apos;ll play , i &apos;m a little überschwänglich .
so he says that it actually makes sense , because players can achieve more than in real life .
they can engage in play more powerful social bonds than in real life , and they get more feedback and rewards in games than in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s totally logical that players spend more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a optimalsituation .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that 2,500 years of zurückliegt .
there are these ancient cube , from schafsknöcheln . do you know ?
prior to these amazing spielecontrollern .
and those were sort of the first of people developed spielgeräte .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the ancient greek historikers historikers herodotus , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to herodotus , games have been erfunden , more würfelspiele , in the kingdom of the kingdom during a famine .
there was such a big famine that the king of lydien came to a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to herodotus , out loud , the würfelspiel and vereinbarten strategy , a day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they &apos;d be so much vertieft in the würfelspiel , because games are so fascinating and uns us with befriedigender produktivität productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and herodotus survived that for 18 years , they survive for 18 years to ate these famine famine , they were eating the next to one day .
likewise , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we &apos;re making games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re going to play a game in order to everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , especially in life befriedigend , and we &apos;ll get what we need to do .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
now , according to 18 years old , after 18 years , the famine was not better . so the king , the last würfelspiel anzusetzen anzusetzen .
they shared the kingdom in two hälften .
they were playing a würfelspiel , and they were allowed to break the best adventure .
they left lydien , and they went looking for a new home . they just let so many people go back to survive , and they were looking for the rest of a place where they were able to thrive .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but recent dna-beweise show that the etrusker , later , later , reich the römische kingdom , the same empire , the same dna .
and so scientists recently came to think that herodotus &apos; insane story is actually true .
and geologists found evidence the evidence of a global abkühlung , which was almost 20 years , which might explain the famine .
so this crazy story could be .
you might actually have saved your people by playing your people in games for 18 years , and then they had these eingebung , and then they learned so much about that they learned that they have saved all civilization .
so we can also .
we &apos;ve been spielen for 1994 .
this was the first strategiespiel in the world of warcraft-serie . it was 16 years ago .
they were playing 18 for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing for 16 years of warcraft .
i said we &apos;re ready to be ready for our own episches .
so , they sent half of their civilization to look for a new world , so i take my 21 billion spielstunden per week .
we should übereinkommen that half of us spend an hour with play , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems the real world in play ? &quot; and exactly this question , i &apos;ve dedicated my work for the last few years .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it &apos;s drückt out of how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to think of the best part , and then people make it empower , this idea of reality .
we siege epische epische and giving people the opportunities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you very briefly about three games that i designed to try to epische people in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is about 2007 .
it &apos;s a online-spiel that you have to overcome a ölknappheit .
so , in fact , in fact , of course , in fact , to be realistic , as much oil , which is going to be realistic , and in fact , in fact , they &apos;re closed in real time , they &apos;re closed in real time , whether they &apos;re closed , and they have to figure out how to make their real life , when it would be true , and we ask them to blog them , to blog videos .
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1.700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve done it since over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epischen , and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go out of oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure to do .
find out how they would survive , most of our players keep making habits in gelernten habits .
so we &apos;ve got a bigger game for the next weltrettende game to put into a greater higher target than just ölknappheit .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; superstruct &quot; at the institute for the future .
now the point is to start the calculation that people have only 23 years left on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global aussterbungs- sensibilisierungs-system , &quot; of course .
the call of gamers , a bone sign , we almost designed a jerry-bruckheimer -film .
you know jerry bruckheimer-filme , where it &apos;s &quot; dream-team , &quot; you have the astronauts , the scientists , the ex-sträfling , and they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , instead of only five people , we say , everybody is in the dream-team , and it &apos;s our job , the future of energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they &apos;re googlen .
and the last game we bring on the third of march . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
by closing the game , you get the award award for the world bank , &quot; social umgestalter , in 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in all across sub-saharan africa , and store them to learn social umgestalten .
we have a comic book . we have to understand &quot; level up &quot; level , wissensvernetzung , sustainability , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in entwicklungsgebieten who are able to imagine their own social enterprise , to save the world .
i &apos;ll come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what , do you think next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope you have to agree with me that players are the resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a great meaning for change .
we have all those superpowers , glückselige productivity , the ability to engage social nets , dringlichkeits-optimismus and desire for epischer meaning .
i really hope that we &apos;re playing meaningful games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me and play with me .
now , in the next decade , i &apos;m sure about two things , i &apos;m sure that we can create every future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let the weltverändernden play games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what i was doing a couple months ago in writing with italian wired magazine .
i &apos;m going to write always my writing day , but i was working with the text process , and i realized that i was never in my life , which really means the word &quot; disabled . &quot;
i &apos;ll read you the post .
&quot; verkrüppelt , verstümmelt , verstümmelt , zugerichtet , zugerichtet , geschwächt , impotent , impotent , gehandicapt , gehandicapt , aus , aus , made out of the traffic , erledigt , done , kaputt , broken , kaputt , ausgezählt , verletzt , verletzt , nutzlos and weak .
antonyme : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
i was reading this list of a friend of reading , and i had to laugh , but i only came up to zugerichtet and couldn &apos;t stop reading , and first of all to read , and first of the überfallartigen wortflut and verbundenden emotional shock .
of course , this was a ausgefranstes , old synonym-wörterbuch , and i thought that has to be quite old .
but in fact , it was a copy in the early &apos; 80s , when i just started with elementary school , and i started to create my sense of self and form my self outside of my family , also in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use a synonym-wörterbuch .
would i take this point seriously in a world that someone like me as a person who would perceive as a person who could be positive , can run positive lives , but i &apos;m going to be the odds and adventures i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately navigated to myself the online-ausgabe of 2009 , in 2009 , that i find a ansprechenderen contribution .
here &apos;s the aktualisierte version of this eintrags .
unfortunately , she &apos;s not much better .
particularly shock me shock to the last two words under &quot; near &quot; near &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people we think about these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many altertümliche societies , including the greeks and the römer , have really believed that the flowering of a fluchs has a great force , because what you &apos;re out loud , you can also manifestieren .
so , what do we want to do manifestieren -- one disabled person or a powerful people ?
just to call a human achtlos as a child , is going to einzuschränken , they &apos;re einzuschränken and beliefs .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open doors ?
a person who opened doors for me was my pediatrician at a.i. dupont institute in wilmington .
he &apos;s called dr. pizzutillo . a italo-amerikaner whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t speak correctly . so he was called dr. p. .
and dr. p. was always wearing very colorful flies , and it was just for work with kids like .
i found the time i &apos;ve been living in this hospital , just great -- until my physiotherapie .
it seems to seem to be unendlich with this big , elastischen bändern -- in various colors -- in various colors -- you know , to build my bein-muskeln . and i hated those tape tape , and i hated it , and i hated her . i hated her .
and imagine , i &apos;ve even seen as a fünfjähriges kid with dr. p. , and so trying to stop doing this practice without success .
and one day he saw me at one of my experiments -- these practice , and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re one day one day off of these bänder .
and if you create it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
now , of course , this was a simple trick to dr. p. , so i do not want to do the richest five five year-old girls in the hospital ward in the second , but it actually brought me to see my daily übungs-horror with new eyes , so it became a new and vielversprechendes experience .
and i ask myself today how much his vision of me as powerful and powerful young girls have shaped my self as being able to see me as one of the strong , powerful and powerful human vision .
this is just one example of many , like adults , in machtpositionen the imagination of a child .
but just as zitierten examples of the synonym-wörterbüchern prove to us , our language doesn &apos;t give us a space to imagine what we all wish : every single person to be able to see itself as powerful people .
our language hinkt the social changes , which in many cases caused by a technological change .
well , of course , my legs , the laser-chirurgie of titan , aus of titan , of titan , of titan , the laser-chirurgie of titan , of titan , has been able to develop their social fate , not talking about social networking platforms , people enable people to define their own identity , in ways , in their own way , in their own way to connect in their own groups that they can choose themselves .
so perhaps again , technological change , because the fact that there was always a different change , which is that every person who can give society a little bit of besonderess and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus .
it &apos;s an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell you about how i umgehe , and i &apos;m going to say something : this sentence has never been gepasst for me , and i always felt very uncomfortable to try to answer the questions of people , and i think , i understand why .
and the idea of dealing with widrigkeiten lives from the idea that success or happiness depends on being a challenge without being shaped by the associated experience , as if my life was so successful , because i could avoid a life of a life with a prosthetic , or as well as people can perceive me with my disability .
but the truth is that we change . of course , of course , we &apos;re dominated by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physically , emotionally , or even both .
and i want to suggest that &apos;s good .
widrigkeiten are not an obstacle that we need to be able to do better with our lives .
widrigkeiten are simply to our lives .
and i tend to see widrigkeiten as my shadow .
sometimes i realize it &apos;s very present , sometimes , sometimes , but it &apos;s all the time .
and i don &apos;t want to have the impact of the kampfs of a human herabsetzen .
there are widrigkeiten and challenges in life and challenges , and all of them are just real , and each person is going to do it differently , but the question is not whether we &apos;re wrong with widrigkeiten , or not , but how we can do it .
so , we &apos;re not just responsible for people we love to preserve schicksalsschlägen , but they &apos;re also preparing to prepare for sure .
and we don &apos;t figure out our kids if we give them the feeling that they cannot adapt .
you have to separate two things : to be able to be the medical fact , to be a medical fact , to be an medizinische and to the other social opinion , whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and permanent disability i had to split with is that the world thinks she could be able to describe me with the definitions .
in our desire to protect people who are in the heart of the herzen , hard truth to the quality of quality of life , or even a prediction that they expect , we need to pay attention to that we have to pay attention to someone that they &apos;re actually disabled .
maybe this is a concept that just look at what &apos;s going on in a broken thing , and how we repair it , and how we fix it for every single one of the bigger disability than in pathologie .
if we don &apos;t treat a human menschen , not all of its forces and opportunities , and acknowledge , in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to lead , another disease .
we degradieren a person who has value for our society .
so we &apos;ve got to look beyond the patologie and focus on all of the human possibilities .
but most importantly , there is between the perception of our unzulänglichkeiten and our great erfindergeist , a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t have to do these herausfordernden times , or deny either , we should not try to avoid you should not try to go under the carpet , but it &apos;s about to see the most dramatic opportunity .
it might be really much more about to ask that we don &apos;t necessarily have to get past widrigkeiten , but that we &apos;re open to give them a hug , you want to put them on the schopf , and maybe even dancing with it .
and maybe we can do it , widrigkeiten as something like natural stimmiges and useful and useful , and we don &apos;t feel like that through their presence .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 . anniversary of charles darwin , and when he wrote about the evolution 150 years ago , darwin , darwin , in my eyes , to something very true in the human nature .
i would use it so , not the most powerful of its species , not the most powerful of its species , but the most of its way to change changes best .
there is a creativity of conflicts .
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive and survival and aufzublühen , from the struggle of the human mind is being transformed through conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation is the greatest set of people .
and maybe we don &apos;t know what wood we are , if we really get shot .
maybe the point of widrigkeiten , a sense of ichs , a sense of ichs , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something so themselves .
we can make a new meaning that goes beyond time .
maybe we can see widrigkeiten as change .
widrigkeiten are a change that we haven &apos;t adapted yet .
i think the biggest damage that we had to do is believe that we should be normal .
honestly , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal normal .
there &apos;s the usual thing . but not the normal normal . and not the normal person , and would you really want to know this poor , gray person really know if you were there ?
i think rather than that .
it would be great if we could take this paradigm of normalität against another one of the possibilities or the strength to say a little bit more dangerous , we can release the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their very special and valuable skills in society .
it turns out that we &apos;ve always had to have a number of our society &apos;s members of our society : useful to be useful .
there are evidence that the neanderthals already have older people and people with severe physical injuries , and that may , perhaps , because the lebenserfahrung in the überlebenskampf of these people &apos;s worth of life , was valuable .
they didn &apos;t look at these people as useless and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went into the city that i grew up in a lebensmittelmarkt in this red zone in the red zone , and i was standing there in front of a scheffel tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had shorts .
and i hear a guy behind me says , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around , and i see these older man , i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , do we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you can barely remember me .
when i first saw it , i pulled her out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , that .
and then , of course , it &apos;s done .
this was dr. kean , a man that i just knew from narratives of my mother about this day , because i was , of course , typical of my birthday came to my birthday two weeks .
the physician &apos;s medical diagnosis of my mother was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world , not at all .
and because i was born without wadenbeine , and my feet had focused on them , and i just had a few toes on this , and some toes at the other hand , he had the überbringer , he had to be the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say , &quot; i had to say , &quot; i had to say , &quot; i had never been able to run , and never be able to be able to be as a dead life , and you &apos;ve never had to go to an independent life . &quot;
i found that he had collected my entire childhood in the second class , whether i had gained my pfadfindern at the way , or one of my sportlichen siege , and he used these clips to teach his students , medizin-studenten from the hahnemann medical school , and the hershey medical school .
and he called this part of his kurses to the x factor , the potential of the human will .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough , how critical of this factor for the quality of life can be a human .
and dr. kean said , he said , &quot; i learned that kids , if they &apos;re not going to be told all the time , and even if they get a little bit of support kids , they can reach a lot . &quot;
see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how somebody deals with it , two different things .
and i &apos;ve changed my thinking over time , if you had asked me at the age of 15 years old , whether i had my prostheses from flesh and bone getauscht , i would have no second gezögert .
i really wanted to be normal .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s what happened , because i experienced my legs , and not despite this experience .
and maybe that change could happen , because i &apos;ve encountered so many people who opened doors , rather than to meet people who einschränken me or to give me an idea .
see , it really takes only only one people who demonstrate how they can manifestieren their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow anybody to activate it , your own , your own mind , the human mind is so empfangsbereit -- if you do that , and for someone in a critical moment , a door open , you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
they bring them to open themselves themselves .
the real meaning of worts roots in the word &quot; educe . &quot;
it means something produces something that is in one , that &apos;s the potential .
again , what potential is we like to call out ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the 1960s , in the u.k. , in the 1960s , was transformed into gesamtschulen .
they call this &quot; streaming trials &quot; in the united states as &quot; tracking . &quot;
students are going to split up grades .
and the a student are going to get mündlich harder , get better teachers , etc .
and then you have a dreimonatigen period of students with a dreimonatigen period of students with a very good note , and they told them , they said , they were asse that they were very smart , and after those three months , they were really einser .
and of course , it breaks the heart that conversely , that conversely , they &apos;re just enough .
and then it was just after the three months .
but just those who were still in school -- aside from students who had beaten school .
that the teachers in this study was that the teachers weren &apos;t eingeweiht .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were just told that they are einser-schüler , and they &apos;re sufficient students with the note enough , and they have taught them , and they &apos;re treated .
the only real disability is a mind that has been broken a mind that has been broken , no hope , no hope . he finds no more schön. with him , kindliche our natural , kindliche , and our native capacity of imagination .
but if we create the human mind that we continue to support the human spirit , and hope to continue to find yourself and other people around themselves , curious , curious , curious and phantasievoll , and then we actually put our forces in a positive positive .
if a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new daseinsformen .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet named hafiz in the 14th century called hafiz in the 14th of the name , not the god of the name , but the god who knows just four words and all the time , he always says : come , dance , dance with me . &quot;
come , dance , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
suppose i said that , by a few changes of your genes , you might have a better memory -- more precise , more precise and faster .
or want to be fitter , more and more power .
do you want to get more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be to live longer in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who always has more creativity than more creativity .
which one would you enjoy most ?
what would you like to do if you could have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably as many of the things that there are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose to have a good memory ?
some more .
how about fitness ? how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority , the majority , i like a doctor .
if you could only get one of them , it would be a whole different world .
is that all a conceit ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been a andauerndes issue here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor &apos;s issue .
the great geneticists in the 20th century , t.g. dobzhansky , who was also a kommunikant in the russian orthodoxen church , wrote a paper , called &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense of any sense of evolution in evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who accept the evidence that accept the biological evolution , that would be a very good time to accept the biological evolution , and maybe you can throw a look at kathryn schultz &apos; book , which is about being wrong , because nothing in the other course of this talk will make any sense for you .
but if you accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for others to do it or anything else ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i have a bush center as a center in all directions , because if you look at the edges of life , all the existing spezien on the branches of these branches have been success in evolutionary terms : they survive ; it &apos;s its environment , fitness , fitness , fitness .
the human part of the human part , far at the end , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
we branches from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period of time , maybe 20 or 25 different parts of hominids .
some of them come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130.000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re right from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually , in the greatest part , the basic mechanisms of the cells are our cells .
is you realize that we can take advantage of it and put the mechanisms of a common bacterium to produce the protein of the human genome system , which is used to treat a diabetiker ?
this is not like humaninsulin ; this is the same protein that is chemically ununterscheidbar from what comes from the pancreas .
and as we talk about bacteria , they realize that each of us in our gut more bacteria than it takes cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , if antonio damasio asks you to wonder , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful gastfreundlichen environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s feucht ; it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to get all the nutrients that you could just wish without a effort .
it &apos;s really a lighter way for bacteria , with occasional unterbrechungen of unintended unterbrechungen , forced stoß to win .
but otherwise they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they are important for their lives .
they help verdauung by essential nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will be in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionäres balance in form of a species ?
or are we going to be something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment better ?
now , let &apos;s take a step back to the time about 14 trillion years ago -- the first signs of living , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first mehr-zelligen organisms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years -- and then the human species , which is what shapes themselves in the last few years ago .
in this riesigen symphony symphony of the universe , life on earth is just a moment ; the animal kingdom , the animal kingdom , and the human life , is a little notenverzierung .
we were .
so this is also the unterhaltungswert of this speech , so i hope , d , d .
well when i was a neuling in college , i had my first biologiekurse .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with evolution in evolution , and i found something very basic : most of the existence of life in einzelligen organisms , each cell , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going on in both tochterzellen .
but at the time , when mehrzelligen organisms came up , things started to change .
sexual reproduction occur in the picture .
and really important : with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome tends to be entbehrlich the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the unausweichlichkeit of the death of our body &apos;s death in evolution is what sexual sexual reproduction .
now , i said , when i was a college-student , i thought , okay , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but with every year , it has come to my increasing doubt .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns who was reading his show in the &apos; 90s in the 1990s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his hotelzimmertür .
he opens the door .
it &apos;s a beautiful spärlich showgirl .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super-sex . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization of this as a doctor , as a doctor , as a doctor , that i was very different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily conflicting , only differently .
i &apos;ve tried to maintain the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to restore the health of the disease .
i wanted to have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about weitergabe the genome on the next generation , adaptation and survival of generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , it &apos;s and i like booster rockets to send the genetic fracht to the next stage of orbit to drop into the ocean .
i think we would all think of your mood , you know , the woody of all the way to the expression that he said , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do immortality through my work .
i want to do it by not going to die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to live the longest life .
it &apos;s not necessarily priviligiert , the strongest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the brightest .
evolution priviligiert the creatures that adapt best to their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
there are bacteria on the bottom of the ocean , and in order to survive the hot steam , if fish were there , it would have a vacuum gekochte fish , and yet they have been able to do a bewohnbare environment there .
so , what does that mean if we look back what happens in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and especially how we vorausschauen into the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a range of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we reached a kind of balance .
and the reason for that is that it &apos;s all about us in medicine , capable of being able to get a lot of genes that would have been rausgewählt and removed from the population .
and secondly , we as a species , as a species have so konfiguriert our environment that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to them as well as we adapt to them .
and by the way , we wander and figuring out so much so much that you can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for evolution , for evolution , for evolution .
a second option is that it will be evolution of the traditional species , of course , of course , auferlegt from nature .
and the argument here is that the wheels of evolution is starting , but they &apos;re unerbittlich .
and so far , that isolation , if we cover a species as a species , will be isolierung and the changes of the environment that can produce evolution in a natural way .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a verlockende , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it neo-evolution -- the new development that isn &apos;t simply of course , of course , of course , but led us to the decisions we do .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let us first look at the reality that people today are making decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , to have more choices than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family choose .
so think , if it wouldn &apos;t just be possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to make genetic adaptations that diseases would cure and prevent disease .
what if you could make the genetic change in terms of diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or eliminate the risk of risk risk ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
if we vorausblicken , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project began in 1990 and it took 13 years .
it cost 2,7 billion dollars .
the following year when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in drein to four months .
today , you can have a sequence of the three billion base base base of the human genome , about a $ 20,000 , and in the room , about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take a long time to be the reality that there will be 1,000 dollars of human genome , and it will be increasingly available for everybody .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering , the national academy of engineering , the national academy of the francis prize for francis arnold and willem stemmer , zwei the natural process of evolution in the natural process of evolution , to work faster and to wünschenswerte proteins in a more efficient way -- which is called frances arnold evolution .
a few years ago , the lasker-preis shinya yamanaka was given to his research in a erwachsene , a fibroblasten , and through the manipulation of only four genes , to induced the cell stem , to stem them into a pluripotent stem cell -- potentially , potentially , any cell in the body will be able to become inside your body .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that makes the human insulin in bacteria can produce viruses that can &apos;t only protect itself , but also for the immunity to other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s a study study with vaccine against vaccine against influenza das that has been grown into the cells of a tabakpflanze .
can you imagine something good that comes from tobacco ?
this is all reality , and in the future , a lot more possible .
now just imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if you could change the sperm and eizellen or the frisch egg , to give your children a better chance for your kids to make a better chance -- eliminating the diabetes , eliminating the risk of cancer , the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science , can make the change possible to prevent disease , could also say goodbye to adoptieren , hyper-kapazitäten -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t we have the schlagfertigkeit of a ken jennings hben , especially if you can expand it to the next generation of watson-maschine ?
why don &apos;t you have the fast muskelfasern that will allow you to run faster and longer ?
why no longer lives ?
these are going to be unwiderstehlich .
and if we &apos;re at a point where we can put it on the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we will be transformed by alt-stil evolution to neo-evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires a 100,000 years , and we can compress it on a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions with those of their grandchildren , or grandchildren , or their grandchildren .
are we using these decisions to form a society that is better than that is more successful ?
or are we to selectively choose different attributes that we have for some of us and not for others ?
will we form a society dielangweiliger and uniformierter , or robuster and vielseitiger and vielseitiger ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to face .
and at the deepest of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom we &apos;re going to need to make these decisions ?
in the good ones , in the good ones , and sooner than you might think , you &apos;re going to be these decisions on us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something now , a portable robot that gives you übermenschliche skills , or another one that helps you go up and get up and go again .
at berkeley bionics , we call these robots exoskelette .
they are nothing other than something that they put them in the morning , and they give them additional strength , and they will continue to raise their velocity , for example , to keep their balance .
this is actually the true verschmelzung of human and machine .
but not only that -- with it together , and connect with the universe and other devices .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re starting to talk about the american soldiers , on average , about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the demand for them to carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- rückenverletzungen , 30 percent of them -- chronic rückenverletzungen .
so we thought that we would embrace that we would think of this challenge and create a exoskelett that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you now -- or human rights load carrier .
soldier : with the hulc-exoskelett , i can carry 200 pounds on verschiedenartiges terrain terrain , a lot of hours .
its flexible design enables it to live deep , in kriechen and höchst movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then increase my strength and persistence .
we &apos;re far as far as we can imagine this device , this new exoskelett in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
let &apos;s look at our view of the wheelchair seats , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people to sit around the world in the wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
now we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord cord spinal cord injury , in the blütezeit of her life -- &apos; 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 30s , and the wheelchair was the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , its numbers .
and so much the only option -- when it comes to a hirnschlag , or the other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and by the way , by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years of how i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chapter in the field of mobility .
so let me show you now elegs , which is being carried by amanda boxtel that &apos;s 19 years ago , who had a rückenmarksverletzung by 19 years ago , that she couldn &apos;t walk anymore for 19 years , and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda wears our elegs .
it has sensors .
his completely non-invasiven sensors in the crutches , the signals zurücksenden on our onboard-computer that &apos;s on her back on their back .
here &apos;s also batteriepackungen , the motorantrieb is in their hips , as well as their kniegelenken , and they move forward in this pretty geschmeidigen and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old and in bestform , as a monströser purzelbaum purzelbaum , as a monströser purzelbaum .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my beckens .
not long after that , a doctor in my krankenzimmer , and he said , &quot; amanda , you will never go back . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he stahl every fünkchen hope of my consciousness .
anpassungsfähige technologies since then , to learn to climb again , to climb back and drive the hands of the hands .
but nothing was invented that i would let me go back to now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda and all of amanda , but for everyone .
thank you .
in new york , i &apos;m the ceo of a non-profit organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t bekämpfe the poverty , i bekämpfe as a gehilfe of a volunteer in a volunteer , the fire .
well , in our city , in which volunteers , they have a hochqualifizierte berufsfeuerwehr , you have to be pretty early on the brandstelle to be mitmischen .
i remember the first fire .
i was the second volunteer in the brandstelle , so i had a pretty good opportunity to go in .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the authorities who were trying to figure out what our jobs would be .
when i found the hauptmann , he was just in a very serious conversation with the hausbesitzerin , which was certainly one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she stood in the schlafanzug and she stood barefoot under a screen outside of a screen , while her house stood in flames .
the other volunteers who was arrived in short of me -- we call him lex luther -- reached the hauptmann as first , and was asked to go into the house and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was sprachlos out .
there was some lawyer or vermögensverwalter who could tell people that he was going to a brennendes house to save a living organism to save a living organism , just because it was five seconds faster than me .
well , i was the next .
the hauptmann winkte winkte me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go into the house .
you need to go up to the fire over , and you have to get a pair of shoes . &quot;
i swear .
well , not exactly what i hope to do , but i went down and down the stairs , the real feuerwehrmännern , the &quot; echten &quot; feuerwehrmännern , &quot; the &quot; feuerwehrmännern , which at that moment they were already getting pretty much done in the bedroom to get some shoes .
i know what you think now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey back down , where i met my erzfeind and the beloved dog .
we put our beliefs out to the hausbesitzerin , where , not surprisingly , of his much more attention than mine .
a couple of weeks later , the feuerwache had a letter in which they were bedankte for the brave operation in saving their house .
so , you know , for a little bit , valued kindness : somebody had a pair of shoes .
in my profession at robin hood , as well as a volunteer in my job , i witness for generosity and kindness in the great scale , but i also see taten and muts of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so when i see myself in this room , and people that they &apos;re either going to succeed , or they &apos;re in their way , i want to offer memory : wait not .
don &apos;t wait for making a difference in a different life , until you &apos;ve reached your first million .
if you have something to give you , please give it .
they operate in a suppenküche in a neighborhood in the neighborhood in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us a chance to save the lives of a man , but every day offers us to change one .
so they go ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of humanity &apos;s secret .
a place where women are going to say hello to sex with sex , and the game determines the day -- where a serious matter .
and no , it &apos;s not burning or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their verwandtschaft .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the forest of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
that means we have a common grandmother , an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressivität .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of überbetont in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
while chimpanzees have led to great , fear , fear of kerlen kerlen , the bonobo-gesellschaft female females .
they have come up with this , because this leads to a ausgesprochen society that has not been seen in the deadly society .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known to primates .
they live in the depths of kongolesischen , and they &apos;re just hard to get accessible .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary diversity and beauty , but also also the heart of darkness -- the scene of a violent debate that has been wütet for decades of a violent , almost as many lives , like world war ii .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that the destruction of bonobos still survive .
fleischhandel and the decline of the baumbestandes lead that you can &apos;t even fill a stadium with the verbliebenen bonobos -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a verborgenes laugh that the trees can upset .
who are these relatives ? ?
we know them as &quot; love &quot; rather than war , because they have häufigen sex , also sex , with wechselnden partners of partners , and social partners and social communities .
i don &apos;t say yes , that &apos;s the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because the life of bonobos is more than the kama sutra .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives long .
play isn &apos;t just kinderspiele .
and it for us , and it &apos;s essential to the attachment of relationships and the care care .
we &apos;re learning trust and the rules of the game .
play requires creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity in interactions , diversity of interactions , diversity of connections .
and when you watch bonobos in the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human lachens , dance and from rituals .
play is the kitt that beieinanderhält us .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique footage from the wild .
first a ballspiel on bonobo-art -- and i don &apos;t think about fussball .
so here we see a young female and males in a verfolgungsspiel .
look at what it does .
this is the evolutionary source of evolutionary , &quot; she puts him on the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s rather , rather , right .
yes !
so sexspiele are common , both with bonobos and in humans .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows up , and this video is really interesting because it shows you new elements of neue new elements of new elements -- like the testes -- and also , how the game promotes both of trust and promote the game -- whereas it &apos;s a great fun .
but the game is a formwandler .
play is a formwandler , and it can have a lot of shapes that some more quiet , phantasievoll , curious , curious -- maybe to discover the surprise again .
and i want to show you , this is fuku , a young female , and she plays peaceful with water .
i think , just as you can play , we sometimes play , and we have boundaries of our inner boundaries of our inner and outward worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that we &apos;re doing research and interact and interact , and the unexpected wiring that we form , are the real nährboden of creativity .
this is just a little vorgeschmack on the insights that bonobos give us to our past and present .
but they also also have a secret to our future , a future where we have to adapt to increasing challenges , with bigger creativity and druch verstärkte .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our anpassungsjoker .
so successfully in order to adapt to a global world , we need to play .
but will we do the best out of our spieltrieb ?
play is not silly .
absolutely essential .
for bonobos and people equally , life doesn &apos;t have equal teeth and claws alone .
just if it &apos;s barely appropriate , maybe it seems to play .
and therefore , my primatenkameraden , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution and play together , while the creativity of kameradschaft and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples , in 1979 in 1979 exactly the same day , at the same moment , every zeugt a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , every zeugt baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time using the zeugung , because if you think of all the time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
imagine just for a moment .
and in this scenario , imagine that in one case , the sperm carries a y chomosom , which is true to the x chromosome .
and in the other case , the sperm is a x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the egg .
both of them are überlebensfähig , both light .
we still come back to these people .
most of my activities , i have two hüte .
in a hat , i &apos;m involved with the story of anatomy .
i &apos;m a graduate school professor , and in this case i study how people with anatomy umgingen -- that means the human body , animal bodies -- as they were thinking about körperflüssigkeiten , with körperkonzepten , as they thought about bodies .
the other hat i carried in my work is the activist , the activist , as a patientinnenanwältin -- or , as i say sometimes , is to say , as a pastor lawyer -- people who are the patients .
in this case , i worked with people who have körpertypen the social norms to ask the social norms .
so , for example , i &apos;ve been working with people who have twins twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with zwergenwuchs -- so people who were smaller .
and very often , i &apos;ve worked with intersexuellen people whose gender is atypisch -- so people who have not the average male or female körpertypen .
and as a general term , we can use the word intersexualität .
intersexualität comes in many different shapes .
i &apos;m just giving you a couple of examples of the types of geschlechtsvarianten that are not the male or female standard standard .
in one case , you might have someone with a xy chromosomenbasis , and the y gene of the y chomosoms leaves the protogonaden that we &apos;ve all got to have to stand up to testes .
and therefore , the testicles is on the fötalen stage testosterone .
but because this individual is missing receptors to the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t react to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called androgenrezeptor-defekt .
so a lot testosterone , but no response to that .
as a consequence , the body evolved more of the typical typical trajectory of the body .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it &apos;s usually until they &apos;re going to puberty and grow their breasts and grow their breasts , and they &apos;re not going to get their period until someone comes out there is something else here .
and they do some tests , and they find out , instead of eierstöcken and uterus , in fact , testicles in and they have a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that this person could actually be the person &apos;s male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , in our bodies , are something called adrenalindrüsen .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the nebennieren locations represent what virilisierende hormones .
most of the women , as i -- i think -- i don &apos;t know how to be a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual job , but i think i &apos;ve probably got the typical one -- most of the women as i &apos;m talking about androgene .
we produce androgen , and we &apos;re talking to androgene .
the consequence is that someone like me actually have a brain that was exposed to a woman who was born with testes , and a androgenrezeptor-defekt .
so , gender is really complicated ; intersexuelle are not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a way , can you be distributed all the bandwidth .
a couple of years ago , i received the phone call a 19 years ago , who was born as a boy , he had a friend , he had sex with his girlfriend , who was living as a man , and he had just figured out that he had a uterus .
he had an extreme form of an innate nebennierenrindenhyperblasie .
he has xx chromosome , and in utero , in the womb , he was so active that they were essentially creating a male hormonumgebung .
and as a consequence , his genitalien male , in his brain , his brain was exposed to the typischeren male part of the hormonenspektrums .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one had anything .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he turned out to be inside that the doctors found out that he was inside female .
okay , just a quick example of intersexualität .
some people with xx chromosomes , which is something called ovotestis , which is eierstockgewebe von .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why kids with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s zwergenwuchs or siamesische twins , whether it &apos;s intersexuell -- surgeons are often adapted to the norm , is not because it would be for their physical health health .
in many cases , these people are perfectly healthy .
the reason why they &apos;ve done many different types of surgical interventions is because they threaten our social categories .
so our system typically is based on the idea that a certain anatomical expression goes along with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is called a woman to have to have a female identity ; being a black person is meant to have an african anatomy in terms of your own story .
so we have this awful vereinfachende idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body , it &apos;s actually something very different , in fact , for us , it &apos;s confused us with these kategorisierungen .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualismus .
and our nation really based on a very romantic concept of individualismus .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is , when children are born , when children are born in a body .
where i &apos;ve seen most exciting , the südafrikanische läuferin caster caster semenya last year whose gender was asked to be asked in berlin in berlin .
many journalists called me asking me the question : &quot; what will you do , &quot; what tells us whether caster semenya female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s no test .
now we now know gender that gender is complicated enough that the nature of us don &apos;t have a line between male and female , or between male and female and weiblich and intersexuell , tastächlich , we &apos;re tastächlich , we have to say , of course , of course , of course .
so , we have a situation where , depending on our science , we need to recognize that these categories that we gave for anatomische kategorien categories of welche categories , which made very simple zuordnungen , to create permanent identitätskategorien , as we &apos;ve adopted .
and that &apos;s not just against gender .
it &apos;s also true in terms of race , which turns out to be much more complicated than our terminologie has allowed .
in our observation , we get into all kinds of unbequemen areas .
we push for example , for example , that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to do about the fact that we &apos;re going to tell you about a few nukleotide ?
whereas we continue to push our science forward , we get increasingly into a zone of the unbehagens where we have to recognize that the simplistischen categories of categories that we have probably been too simple .
we see that in all sorts of human life .
one of the areas where we see this is , in our modern culture , today , in our culture , in the world today &apos;s united states , are the struggle about the beginning and the end of the life .
we have a hard conversation about what &apos;s going to be a body for people , so that he has a different right than fetal life .
we have very difficult controversy today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- the question of when someone is dead .
our ancestors never had so hard to fight to the question when someone was dead .
they kept a feder under the nose , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t buried them yet .
if you weren &apos;t moving , you have them buried them .
but today we are in a situation where we &apos;re going to take people to take organs and transplant them other people .
and as a result , we got to get in the fight with the really difficult question , when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have more simple categories as they used to .
now you would assume that the whole crash was somebody going from categories like me really happy .
i &apos;m political progressiv , i &apos;m verteidige people with unusual bodies , but i must admit it makes me nervous .
to realize that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , macht me .
and it makes me angespannt by thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this anspannung , i first got all bekennen that i &apos;m a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were rassisiten , i know they were sexisten , but they were great .
i find that they were so tapfer and strong , and radically , in which what they did , that i think of dabei das das , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happening with the gründungsvätern .
the founding fathers were in my view of the initial anatomischen activists , so that &apos;s why .
what she was doing was a anatomisches concept , and they were replaced it through another that was radical and beautiful , and it was significant for us .
as you remember everyone , our fathers refused to the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the masters of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept based on dna , but they had a concept of geburtsrechts .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people , the political power , had these political power , because of the vererbten blutlinie from the grandfather to son , and so on .
and the founding fathers came back this idea and replaced them through a new anatomisches concept , and this concept , and that concept that all human beings were creating the same individual .
they nivellierten the playing playing at the field , and they decided that it was anatomisch that count , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they made this part because they were part of a aufklärerischen system in which two things together .
democracy grew , but at the same time , the science grew .
so if you look at the history of the founding fathers , clearly , many of you were interested in science , and you were interested in a naturalistischen world .
they went away from explanations , kind of übernatürlicher ways , and meadows things like a supernatural concept , back to where the transmission of a very vagen concept is based on a very vagen concept .
they moved to a naturalistischen concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , you talk about nature and god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature of god .
they talk about nature &apos;s power to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they did a concept of anatomischen commonalities .
and they have prepared for the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think so much about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened years after that ?
so , for example , for instance , the women used to say that , for example , and they said , &quot; the gebärmutter anstrebten , &quot; and said , is not significant enough , as a difference , that we shouldn &apos;t have the wahlrecht , the right on full citizenship , to fully eigentum , etc . , etc . , etc . &quot;
and women argumentierten argumentierten .
next , the successful civil rights movement next , where we were seeing people like sojourner truth , , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the marschierenden row rows of bürgerechtsbewegung , who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people more color that are berufen , in fact , die differences , wieder differences , again .
we see the same thing in the behindertenrechtsbewegung .
of course , the problem is that , as well as we start looking at all of the similarities , we need to be wondering why we maintain certain trennungen .
now , mind , i want to maintain certain trennungen , anatomisch , in our culture .
for example , for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a man .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that 5-jährige should be the right to give their consent to sex or to marry .
so there are some anatomical trennungen that make sense for me , and that &apos;s what we do , i think .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it are , and why we keep them useful .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that are gezeugt at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both the mitte of 1979 at the same time .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , was born three months of verfrüht , so she was born on june 1 1980 .
heinrich , on the other side , it &apos;s born to the geburtstermin , so he was born one march in 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria three months of verfrüht was born , she got all kinds of rechte heinrich -- to have sex in the right , to choose to choose the right .
heinrich has to wait for all of this , not because he actually has another biological biology , just because of the zeitpunktes of his birth .
we find other more merkwürdigkeiten about what their rights are .
heinrich , because it assumes that he &apos;s male -- even though i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s with xy -- because you think that he &apos;s male , he can go moved in , what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
but maria , in all states , in all states , in all states , the heinrich heinrich in all states , and that &apos;s right to marry .
heinrich can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman today in a few states .
so we &apos;ve got these permanently anatomischen categories that are problematic and questionable .
and the question for me is : what are we going to do , because our science is doing these advances in the field of anatomy , that we have to say that we have to admit that a democracy is based on anatomy , auseinanderfallen ?
i don &apos;t want to give the science , but at the same time it feels like the science is on its own power .
so where do we go ? ?
it seems like our culture is a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; well , we &apos;ve got to move somewhere , so we &apos;ll pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people get caught in a very strange position .
so for example , texas , at a point , decided that to marry a man , you have no y chromosome , you have to marry a woman , you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i told you about the androgenrezeptor-defekt .
if we look at the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; a dream of a solution .
he says we shouldn &apos;t be human after &quot; your skin color , but after the character of her character , &quot; and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you email people from their charaktereigenschaften ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that , i &apos;m not sure that we should distribute the rights in terms of people because i have to admit that i know that i know a series of golden retriever , which are probably more likely to make benefits than some people i know .
i want to suggest that i &apos;m probably familiar with some light labradorhunde , which are fähiger , fähiger , more intelligent and more intelligent and more mature decisions on their sexual relations than some 40-jährige , i know .
so how are we supposed to ask the properties of the character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
and part of me asks you , what if the contents of a personality would be something that would be in the future -- could be made by an fmri visible ?
do we really want to go into that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is really leaders about questions about questions about questions .
in our commitment to democracy , we &apos;ve done our things right , and i think we would do well in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like in iran , where a man who feels sexually to other men who was drawn to other men , was it &apos;s ready to be prepared to put themselves in a geschlechtsumwandlung , where he may be able to live in .
in the way we don &apos;t exist .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i talked about a couple of years ago , who had a couple of twins , who had twins , had to separate them , to be partly a name .
but when i telefonierte him , and asked him why he was making these interventions -- they were highly riskante surgeries -- was his answer to his country , these children would be very bad , and that &apos;s why he had to do it .
and i said , &quot; well , now , you have a political asylum , instead of dividing them ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible ways to allow people to be able to be able to be able to be able to change the state .
so i think we have to be leaders .
well , just to finish , i want to notice that i talked a lot about dads .
and i want to think about the possibility of how democracy could look , or looked like democracy could look , if we had the mothers involved .
and i want to say something a feminist is something a feminist thing , and that i think i think there might be different kinds of insight from different kinds of insights from different types of anatomy , insbesonders when people are applying a gruppendenken .
since years , i &apos;ve been interested in intersexualität myself , i was also interested in research in the geschlechterdifferenz of geschlechterdifferenz .
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and act in the world .
what we &apos;ve seen from kulturübergreifenden studies is that women , on average -- not every , but on average -- tend to be more interested in complex social relationships and caring for people who are vulnerable to people who are vulnerable to the group .
and so , if we think about this , we have an interesting situation .
and years ago , when i went to graduate school , one of my favorite stories , who knew my interest to feminism -- i looked as a feminist , so it &apos;s still doing it -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism is a female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about gender about gender , so that feminism is not a female .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought it could be a little bit of weibliches on feminism .
it would mean , there might be something , on average , which makes women &apos;s brains differ from male , which makes us social relationships for hochkomplexe social relationships for the schutzbedürftige .
so , the founding fathers were extremely bedacht to find how individuals could be able to find how individuals could be able to find how individuals could be able to protect how to be able to be able to make more a concept of how to protect them , but how to worry about each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go in the future , if we need democracy to think about anatomy -- less about individual bodies to think about what identity and to think about relationships .
so that if we &apos;re trying to relate to the people , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with outfits .
i love to get an opportunity to do some sort of crazy kind of crazy outfit , to photograph some kind of crazy outfit and blog .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes from the second hand on flohmärkten and in second-hand-shops .
thank you . thank you .
second-hand-shopping allows me to reduce the impact of my garderobe to the environment , and also my purse .
i meet all kinds of great people , my dollars usually for a good purpose ; i think it &apos;s quite unique , and it &apos;s making it shopping to my own personal schatzsuche .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers are loud , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i tell you what i &apos;ve been doing for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does anybody do with so many outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven paar unterhosen unterhosen , and that &apos;s all .
home for exactly one week , everything i did in my suitcase .
i bet that i would have everything i wanted to wear , if i came to palm springs .
and since you haven &apos;t heard of me as the woman who walk here at ted in her underwear -- means that i found a couple of things .
and i want to show you my outfits for this week .
sounds good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to leave you some of the lessons that i &apos;m , whether you believe it or not , you &apos;ve learned to have learned nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the luminous tigers .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole kind , including the jacket , including me 55 times , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this week .
monday : color is a little powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible impossible to be able to be schlecht hosen .
if you &apos;re happy , you get other people happy people .
tuesday : anpassung is totally überbewertet .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time my life to try to be able to be , and adapt me at the same time .
just be who you are .
if you surrounded yourself with the right people , you will not just understand it , you &apos;ll appreciate it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people say i looked like i &apos;d like to play &apos; games , or i remember , and remember her seven-year-olds .
i like smile , and i say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at it in a little good , it &apos;s almost like this .
and if you think that you don &apos;t look good in something , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to wrap it up for a minute .
if you believe that they &apos;re in the outside , and a wonderful person , then there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to rocken everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : passen passen .
and finally , saturday : a new , unique , personal style is a great way to tell the world something about one , without having to say a word .
and it &apos;s been proven to me over and over and over again , when that week , just because of this week , just because of what i was wearing . and i had great conversations .
obviously that &apos;s not going to fit all into my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to give it all .
because the lesson i myself are trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to get these things emotionally , because just around the corner , it &apos;s going to be a different kind of crazy , farbenfrohes , strahlendes outfit that just wait for me when i love a little bit in the heart , and search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everyone together .
i have something i want to show you .
think of this as a bildpunkt , as flying bildpunkt .
this is what we call wahrnehmbares design , wahrnehmbares design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m very italiener , and every boy in italy , it &apos;s growing in his room in italy , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is what happened in the past decades , something very interesting happened in the last decades .
now some time ago , it was that if you wanted to win a single formula on a race , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the car was good enough , they won the race .
now , if you want to win a race , you need something like this -- something that has überwacht the car in real time , the information from the car to pass this information on the system , and then process it , and then , and use that , and use that to make decisions back in this car and change things in real time .
so this would be called ingenieurteams .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made out of two parts -- a spürenden portion and a reagierendenteil .
what &apos;s interesting today is the echtzeit-kontrollsysteme start to appear in our lives .
our cities have been equipped in the last few years , right now with networks and electronics .
they become a computer in free .
and as a computer in free , they start to respond to other ways , they &apos;re perceived and driven .
if we herrichten cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
but by the way , i want to say that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population is living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energiekonsums -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something about the cities , it &apos;s a big deal .
beyond the cities , all of this kind of view , and are driving in the objects of everyday life .
this is by an exhibition , the paola antonelli for moma later , during the summer , in the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
now , all our objects , our environment , start talking to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every atom is out there to both the atom , a sensor and a antreiber .
and that &apos;s changing the interaction that we have in humans with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , it &apos;s called the hammer , and he threw him on moses -- in fact , you can still see a little bit of a place -- and i said , &quot; perché non parli ? why don &apos;t you do ? &quot;
well , today , our environment begins to answer us .
i &apos;m going to show you just some examples -- again , with the idea of understanding our environment .
let &apos;s start with sense of it .
now the first project i want to introduce to you is in fact one of the first of our labs .
it was formed in italy and a half years ago .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually used to use a new kind of use of using network that was used throughout the world -- this is a mobiltelefonnetz -- and anonymous information and aggregierte information from this network that are already collected from the operators to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was won by italy italy .
some of them will remember , it was played as italy in france , and then at the end zidane , the kopfstoß .
and anyway , italy , in italy , in italy , in italy , has won at the end .
now you see what happened to the day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see the kolosseum , the fluß tiber .
in the morning , before play .
you see the timeline .
early afternoon , people here and there that are making calls and moving .
the game starts -- silence .
france is making a gateway . italy .
halbzeit , the people make a brief call , go to toilet .
second halbzeit . end of the normal line .
first extension , second .
zidane , in a moment of kopfstoß .
italy , italy . yeah .
now , at this night , everyone went to the center to celebrate .
they saw the big difference .
the next day , all went to the center to meet the siegerteam and the prime minister at the same time .
and then all went down .
you see the picture of the space &apos;s space , where , since the roman time , the people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you &apos;ll see the implication of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
even quickly , another example of argument : this is not about people , but it &apos;s about things that we use and consume .
now , today we know how our things come from .
this is a map that you can see all the chips that have a computer , which is how they came together .
but we just know little about where things go .
so , in this project , we actually designed some little markers in this project to pursue the garbage as it comes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers who were helped us , a little bit more than a year in seattle helped to tag the things that they would wegwarfen -- different kinds of things like you can see -- things that you would throw away anyway .
then we have the little chips , the little brands , the little brands that geklebt the trash and start tracking it .
here are the results we just got .
by seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of ineffizienzen in the system .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of unnützer transporte and complicated things .
the other thing about the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that we throw away , not just disappears that it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw away every day is still going to be there .
and if we would show the people , then we can move behavior change .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman biderman , could tell you a lot more about feeling and the many other things you can do with sense , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we discussed in the beginning , and that &apos;s the most of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a couple of years ago in zaragoza , spain .
and it started to be a question of bürgermeisters , which came to us and said that spain and südeuropa have a beautiful tradition , in public places as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology with it ?
and one of the ideas that were left at mit was , imagine these tubes , imagine these tubes , and the valves , magnetventile , valves that open and closing .
they cause something like a wasservorhang with bildpunkten water .
if these bildpunkte fall down , they can write patterns , images , text ads .
and you can approach it , and it will open up to allow you to see how you can see how you see in this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of belloch .
it was very much .
and we got to make a building building a building the expo .
we called it the digital water .
all the building was made out of water .
there are no doors or windows , but when they approach it , it will open up and let them go in .
the roof was also covered with water too .
and if it &apos;s windy , if you want to reduce that syringes , you can even leave the roof .
or you could close this building and get the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , when you see the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t break the building , it &apos;s just that architecture is almost away .
here you see how the building works .
you see the person who asks what happens inside .
and here you see me when i was trying to test the sensors that opened water to get wet .
now , i should tell you what one night happened as all the sensors .
but it was actually a greater fun in this night .
all the kids from zaragoza came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
it &apos;s no longer a building a building that opens up open to you , but a building that &apos;s still breaks away and holes in the water , you had to jump now without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people who use things that we design .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
and this is the nice thing to create things that are used and interact with people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical bildpunkten , the bildpunkten of water and the projections .
and this is what taught us to think about this project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that you could actually start to fly to fly .
imagine if you could have little helicopters that flies through the air , and all of you with a little bit of bildpunkt light with wechselndem light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the ones you saw earlier that you &apos;ve seen with others , moves in perfectly synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexiblen screen or display like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or , in three dimensions , in three dimensions , in which what changes the light is not the position of bildpunkte .
you can play with different species .
imagine the screen could just appear in different formaten or sizes , in different ways .
but then it could be just a 3d cloud of bildpunkten that you can walk around and move through that you can look through many , many directions .
so here you see a real flyfire-steuerung , the herabsinkt , like , to form a gleichmäßiges v .
if you turn on the light , it looks like this . so as we &apos;ve seen it before .
imagine that every single one is being controlled .
it could have a impulse every single bildpunkt that comes from human beings , from the movements of people or so .
i want to show you something here .
we &apos;ve been working with roberto bolle , one of the best balletttänzer of our time -- étoile at the metropolitan theater at the metropolitan theater in new york and the scale of milan -- we took his movements in 3d to use it as momentum to the flyfire .
here you see roberto dancing .
on the left you see the bildpunkte , the different sensations .
it &apos;s at the same time , at the same time .
so that you can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we all have bildpunkte , you can play with it , and play with color gravity and drehbewegung .
and we want to use this as a potential for flyfire .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
the idea is , again , imagine that we put the people in order to do something , and to change the environment -- almost as much as we call it , as we call it , einzubauen the way to incorporate a scheunentor , but with a cloud .
imagine that everyone can give a little donation for a bildpunkt .
i think that the remarkable thing that happened over the last few years , the last decades , is that we &apos;ve changed from a physical world to a digital world .
that has all digitized , knowledge , knowledge , and makes it accessible through the internet .
now , for the first time , we can for the first time -- and the campaign the campaign has shown this -- can we change from the digital world , from the selbstorganisierenden forces of the networks of the networks of the physical world .
this can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is something that &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can to ask us the challenges -- think -- think about the climate change or the co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world .
so the idea is that we actually put the people in the people in which they relate to things together .
the cloud is again a cloud of bildpunkten , in the same way like a real cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of bildpunkten .
it &apos;s a physical physical device in london , but with bildpunkten covers .
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments of olympia 2012 and the other part , and use it as a kind of connection to the community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky , and something at the top they can go on , like london &apos;s new berggipfel .
you can go inside .
and a kind of digital leuchtturm in the night -- but as a allerwichtigstes , a new kind of experience for everyone who want to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , the context is very important to me .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people aren &apos;t separate from nature and that everything is connected .
the first time i was in antarctica almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first eisberge .
i state awe awe awe .
my heart hit me , i was schwindelig while i was trying to grab what was before me .
i &apos;d almost almost 60 feet out of the water , and i just couldn &apos;t wonder that this was a snowflake on a different snowflake , year after year .
eisberge were born to be a calf of a glacier or kalb out of eisschollen .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
they interact with a clear way of their environment and their experiences .
some refuse to give up and klammern to the bitter end , whereas others can &apos;t be able to withstand and do it in a anfall dramatic passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think that they &apos;re isolated , separate , and alone , as we see people often .
but the truth is far away .
as melt on a iceberg , i atme his vorzeitliche atmosphere .
during the iceberg , he melts setzt drinking water , that feeds a lot of life .
i &apos;m going to go to my footage in this eisberge , as if i &apos;d do portraits of my ancestors , in the conscious mind , that they exist in those individual moments , and never become like this .
it &apos;s not a death , if you melt ; it &apos;s not the end , it &apos;s a fortführung of her pfades along the life cycle .
part of the ice that i photographiere is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is a iceberg that i put in greenland in greenland in greenland .
very rarely , you actually witness a rollenden iceberg .
here you see it now .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please pay attention to the shape of the iceberg , where it &apos;s in the wasserlinie .
you can see here , he begins to roll , and the boat moved to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a grönland-eisbergs .
it reaches about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and simple , you show you a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really blessed by work in some amazing projects .
but what i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy .
his name is tempt .
tempt was one of the leading graffitikünstler in the &apos; 80s .
then one day , he came back from walking back , and said , &quot; paps , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of that .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood up to him .
so i have a company that makes design and animations , so it &apos;s inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the art world and look attention .
so we decided , tony -- tempt -- and supporting his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk to tony .
and i just want to say , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , is it not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all the paralyzed people communicate using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard the higher insurance and a remarkable insurance , you can do that .
normal people are not available these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
did anybody see the film schmetterling and taucherglocke ?
so they communicate -- they &apos;re walking along .
i &apos;m like , &quot; very archaisch , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came with the need , just like , just a check , and instead i asked a check , i didn &apos;t know the smallest idea of how i should be einlösen .
i verpflichtete to his brother and his father , and his father -- saying , &quot; well , my proposal is : tony will speak , we &apos;ll get him a device , and we &apos;ll find a way , and we &apos;ll find a way to do his art .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s wearing all that it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i talked about a couple of months later .
i met these people from grl , graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface , and then draw with a laserpointer , which is just the negative area .
so they move around , and they make kunstinstallationen like this .
they say that all the things that are shown on the top of a life cycle .
it starts with the geschlechtsteilen , then the schimpfwörter , and finally , the bush-verleumdungen , they &apos;re actually doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in her presentation .
and so i went home and she was saying , &quot; well , second , if you have this technology that you can use your eyes to control things , then you should find a way to control a laser that tempt a laser , so that it can make a graffiti again , that would be great . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a year , a lot of organization and lots and a lot of things , we &apos;ve achieved some things .
first , we were using the names for the doors , and actually , in fact , to get a device that he can communicate with -- a stephen hawking-maschine .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him yoda , because you &apos;re talking to him , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so unwürdig , this guy is incredible . &quot;
furthermore , we have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my kids , my kids , and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and verschwörungstheoretiker , and anarchisten our house .
a lot of our friends thought that we were beautiful to be stupid that we were beautiful to do it , and we zurückkämen , and all the images on the walls were graffitis .
but for over two weeks , we have programmed , we went to strandpromenade in venice , and my children were involved , my dog was also , and we created this .
it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap sonnenbrille that we bought on the strandpromenade of venice , something kupferdraht and a couple of things out of the hardware store and elektronikhandel .
we took a ps3-kamera , they &apos;ve set up on a led-licht , and now we have a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it yourself , we can make the code for free , the software you can download for free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of limitations .
no insurance can be querstellen .
no hospital .
now , every gelähmte can actually communicate with his eyes alone .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to tempts room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
there &apos;s all this rummel rummel before the great unveiling .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks programmierarbeit , nudelparties and durchgemachten nights , tony drew tony after seven years .
and this is amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he sees his life support system .
we geneigt his bed so that way to see it outside .
we &apos;ve set a pipeline set up to a wall of the parkplatztes hospital .
and he drew again for the first time , in the beisein of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling that was in the parking lot .
so we also had to be in the parking lot in the parking lot , so we felt as a part of the sprüher-szene .
at the end , he sent us an email with this content : &quot; for the first seven years , i drew something .
i feel the feeling , i got under water , and finally , somebody raised down and raised my head up , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
that &apos;s something like our kampfschrei .
that keeps us in the stick , and let us continue .
and we need to improve a lot about this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a zaubertafel .
and somebody who has potential such potential , deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to do it better , faster and stronger .
since that time we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
we won a couple of prices .
think it &apos;s free , it &apos;s free , none of us .
it &apos;s all from our pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong twitterte over us and then , in december , in december , has been honored to us , as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
the coolste of it is -- and that includes the whole circle -- that april , in geffen moca in the inner city of los angeles in the inner city of los angeles in the city of los angeles .
and there are probably as much as the toughest representatives of the straßenkunstszene -- banksy , shepard fairey , caws -- all these guys are going to be there .
tempt will be part of the show , which is pretty wild .
so basically , i &apos;m thinking , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then , do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eyewriter -- everything was impossible .
you can do it -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i never had anything to do with augenerfassungstechnologie , but i just collected something and surround me with amazing people so we could put something on the legs together .
and that question was to ask each of you and every single day you have to do something that needs to be done , and if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , when do you know when ? and if not me , who then ?
thank you .
so , i &apos;m writing for children , and i &apos;m probably in america &apos;s gelesener kinderbuchautor .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or leather , but no one has ever chosen farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and offenbarungen .
well , an epiphany is usually something you find , because you &apos;ve left it somewhere .
you &apos;re going to the block and take it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends has made it -- richard bollingbroke .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i &apos;d like to tell you today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at high school in stow , ohio , where i was the klassenschwuchtel .
i was the one that every week in the jungentoilette green and blue was beaten to my life until a teacher teacher .
she saved my life by letting me use the toilet in the lehrerzimmer .
she did her heimlich .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had a thumb , and i proposed to san francisco , and i proposed to san francisco -- i found a lover -- and then in the &apos; 80s i found it important to aids-organisationen .
about three or four years ago , i received a call in the middle of this teacher , a woman post , who said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
please come to ohio ohio , and please come up with the guy who i know you &apos;ve found it in now .
and i should mention that i have bauspeicheldrüsenkrebs , and i want you to be a hurry . &quot;
now the next day we were in cleveland .
we saw them , we laughed , and we cried , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , and we took them down , we took them , and we took them for their family eight , because it needed necessary .
it was something that we knew .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , i got to know me , she turned into a box of a box and turned into my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation i &apos;ve been talking about .
the revelation is that death is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that &apos;s been mentioned here today .
it takes the same -- he would need love , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , while you rise to 1,000 meters .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine a engine , klack , klack , klack , klack , klack , klack , klack .
it sounds einflößend .
well , i had a unique place on that day ; i was sitting on 1d .
i was the only one who could talk to the flugbegleitern .
so i looked at her moment , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve actually caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot had the engine already , and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened simultaneously .
the pilot set up the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
he switches the engines .
imagine a geräuschloses airplane .
and then he said three words -- the emotionslosesten words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; bereitmachen . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the bordpersonal .
i could see it in their eyes , there was horror that life was at the end .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment , it &apos;s everything else .
we have this lebensplan , we have these things we want to do in life , and i was thinking about all the people i wanted to get one hand and didn &apos;t , all the fences i wanted to do , all the experiences i wanted to do and never did .
while i was thinking about it later , a saying a saying , &quot; i collect bad wines . &quot;
because when the wine is , and the person is there , i open it .
i never want to move anything in life .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing that i learned from this day -- and that was when we had the george washington bridge , pretty much about haaresbreite -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really bereue .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i strebte to get better to become better what i &apos;m doing .
but i have given my humanity in my humanity also .
and i bedauerte the time that i &apos;ve wasted with bedeutungslose things , with people who mean something .
and i was thinking about the relationship with my wife , to people .
and then , when i was thinking about this , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i did not leave my wife with my wife .
it feels great .
i don &apos;t try to have any more , right ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing that i learned -- while the internal clock beginnnt , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please flieg in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts of the way you know it .
while we abstürzen , i had this feeling , man , to die is not terrifying .
almost as if we prepare to prepare for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and the sadness formierte really in a thought , is that i just wish one thing .
i just wish i could see my kids growing up .
about a month after that a month , i went to my daughter -- erstklässler , not a lot of künstlerisches talent ...
not yet .
and i feiere , i cry like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made sense for me .
i realized that when i connected the dots , in life , that it &apos;s just about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else is my single goal in life to be a good father .
i realized that the miracle i was not dying at that day .
i got another gift , which is to look back in the future and come back and live differently .
my call to all of you today is : imagine what happens , the same thing happens on your flight -- don &apos;t -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
what would they get done , because they think they would be there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , you know , are the best parents that you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stuxnet computer-wurm is pretty straightforward .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is uran-anreicherungs-einrichtung in natanz .
the gray boxes you see here , these are echtzeit-kontrollsysteme .
now , if we are able to manage the systems that control systems and the valves , we can actually create a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with windows-software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but when we do it , an effective windows-virus is used on a laptop that &apos;s used by a wartungsingenieur , to konfigurieren this gray box , and then we &apos;re in business .
and this is the design planning .
so we start with a windows-dropper .
the nutzdaten are going to pass into the gray box , zentrifuge and the iranian kernenergie-programm of kernenergie-programm -- auftrag .
that &apos;s a kinderspiel , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started stuxnet , six months ago , six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the purpose and purpose of this konstrukts .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated , very complicated , of course , of course , is the dropper- part , he made a number of zero- day- day- schwachstellen .
and it seemed a little bit vorzuhaben with these gray boxes , these gray boxes .
the erregte of our attention , and we started a labor- project , where we brought our environment infected , and we studied this construction .
and then something weird happened .
stuxnet was like a laborratte , who didn &apos;t like our cheese -- schnüffelte , but didn &apos;t want to eat him .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we were experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i was going to attack this .
at a particular destination .
the dropper streift active active on the gray box , when a special configuration was discovered , even if this particular program was found to get infected on this goal .
and if not , don &apos;t do anything .
so , really got my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , a us- american power station , or be a chemieanlage in germany .
so we should be able to figure out what the goal is .
so , extrahierten and dekompilierten , we found the angriffs- code , and we found it in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a bigger .
and we also noticed that they were very professional designed by people who had obviously all insider- information available .
they knew they knew all bits and bytes they had to attack .
they actually knew the schuhgröße of the maschinenbedieners .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already heard that the dropper of stuxnet complex and high-tech is , let me tell you : the nutzdaten are a science for themselves .
it &apos;s much more difficult than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here &apos;s an excerpt from this angriffs- code code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
it looks pretty altmodische assemblersprache assemblersprache assemblersprache .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be able to get out of this code .
so after all we were looking at first , systemfunktions- aufrufe were systemfunktions- , because we know what they do .
and then we looked for timern and we were looking for timern , and tried to connect with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could prove or disprove .
to make these theories , we call ourselves in memory that it &apos;s definitely about hochgradige sabotage , it has to be a hochwertiges goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because there were the infections that most of the infections were reported .
well , in this area , there are no thousands of goals .
it &apos;s basically running out on the buschehr nuclear power plant and on the urananreicherungsanlage .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; i &apos;m going to use a list of all the experts for zentrifugen and power power plants . &quot;
and i called them and i call them the knowledge to compare their expertise to compare what we &apos;ve found in the code .
and that worked very well .
so , it was us possible to bring the little bit to the little digital sprengkopf with the rotorsteuerung .
the rotor is the zentrifuge part of the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and when you manipulate the speed of this rotors , you actually is able to crack the rotor , and even get a centrifuge to explode .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually , it was actually going to let it happen to be able to make it happen , slowly , trying to be able to try to have a wartungsingenieure to try to do that , so that you can &apos;t be able to get quickly to that .
the great digital sprengkopf -- we got a glimpse of it by looking at the exact data and the datenstrukturen .
so , for example , the number of 164 is very out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started with it , scientific literature , like this zentrifugen in natanz , and found out that they &apos;re strukturiert in what &apos;s called the kaskaden , and each kaskade contains 164 zentrifugen .
so that makes sense , it fit together .
and it got better .
these zentrifugen in iran are divided into 15 .
and guess what we found in the angriffscode ?
almost identical structure .
so again , that fit really well .
and this gave us great confidence for what we studied here .
well , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just like that .
these results have been achieved by several weeks of hard work .
and we just run in a sackgasse , and we had to neu .
anyway , we found that both digital warheads are actually really on one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little sprengkopf takes over a kaskade , and überdreht die and überdreht , and der it , and the large sprengkopf starts to interact with six kaskaden in interaction and manipulated .
so , in the large and all of us , we &apos;re very confident that we &apos;ve actually created what the goal is .
it &apos;s natanz , and it &apos;s just natanz .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be made by stuxnet .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- made me out of my socks .
down there &apos;s the gray box down there , and on top on top of it .
now , what this thing is that this thing is that it eingehenden from sensors from sensors -- for example , from drucksensoren and vibrationssensoren -- and it puts legitimen code code that is still during the attack , with the eingehenden data daten .
and in fact , this false data data from stuxnet before .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywoodfilmen , during the verfolgungsjagd , while the überwachungskamera mit mit .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
this idea here is obviously not just überlisten die in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more violent .
the idea is überlisten a digital sicherheitssystem .
we need digital sicherheitssysteme there , where a human maschinenbediener can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power plant , for example , if the big dampfturbine is going to quickly , you need to be opening entlastungsventile within milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human maschinenführer .
so at this point , we need digital sicherheitssysteme .
and if that are at risk , then really bad things can happen .
the power plant can explode .
and neither the maschinenführer , nor the sicherheitssystem will notice it .
that &apos;s frightening .
but it gets worse .
and what i say now is very important .
think about it . this attack is generisch .
he has nothing specifically to do with zentrifugen , with urananreicherung .
so , for example , he would work exactly so well -- in a power plant or a power plant .
it &apos;s generisch .
and you don &apos;t have to -- when the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to put the nutzdaten on the usb- stick , as we saw it .
you could also use ordinary wurm- technology to spread .
you have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you get a cyber- massenvernichtungswaffe .
that &apos;s the consequence that we need to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for attacks are not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the zielreichsten environments .
we need to ask the consequences , and we get better to prepare .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was very much reported that people assume that the mossad is the hauptorganisation behind it .
is that yours also ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think the mossad is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the cyber- of superpower .
there &apos;s only one , and these are the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you , you have a heidenangst eingejagt . thank you .
i spent the last couple of years trying to place in situations that are usually very difficult and somehow dangerous .
i went to jail -- difficult .
i worked in a kohlebergwerk -- dangerous .
i filmed in kriegsgebieten -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days trying to eat nothing like this -- fun at the beginning , a little difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
i actually have given the greatest part of the seem to be exposed to fürchterlichen situations , and it &apos;s all the way to try to look at social sites that they &apos;re compelling and interesting , and hopefully , in a way to understand what it &apos;s fun for the audience and fun .
so when i knew that i was going to come here to look at the world &apos;s tedtalk and look at sponsoring , i knew i would make something different .
some of you may have heard that i put an advert on ebay a couple weeks ago .
i would send some facebook-nachrichten , some twitter-nachrichten , and i gave people the opportunity to erstehen the namensrechte on my tedtalk 2011 .
so , in fact , a few happy people and companies , i &apos;ve got an amazing opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let this happen again -- the namensrechte of the talk you just can see , who &apos;s not a lot of content at the moment , didn &apos;t have a lot of content , and not a lot of evidence of what the subject was supposed to be .
so what you get here was : your name here : my tedtalk , which you have no idea of what &apos;s going to be , which is going to be the subject to the content for the ears , especially if i had your company stupid for your involvement .
but it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the arbeitstitel .
so , despite that warning , i knew anyone would buy the namensrechte .
if you had asked me this a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to say that to you .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve been moving into some pretty terrible situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , i couldn &apos;t get to anything that was so difficult to go to something so complicated and so dangerous as these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is a film about product placement , marketing and advertising , with all the film that &apos;s funded by product , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the greatest movie ever ever . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the greatest movie ever &quot; in the beginning , from the beginning , from the beginning to the end , to the other brands -- from the titelsponsor that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand x. .
now this brand , the qualcomm stadium , the staples center ... ...
these people will be connected to the film in eternity -- forever .
and so the movie is going to examine this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity forever ?
i &apos;m a redundante person .
that was more to honor .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to have the brand x than titelsponsor , but we &apos;ll make sure we &apos;re going to sell any possible category in the movie .
so we might sell a shoe , and he will be the greatest shoe that they &apos;ve ever carried ...
the greatest car that they have ever gone from &quot; the greatest movie ever sold &quot; the greatest drink that they &apos;ve ever had , a awareness of &quot; the greatest movie ever .
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are part of the life of life , are part of the life of being part of the movie ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the movie is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole movie in the movie of statten .
so this is the whole concept , the whole movie , from the beginning .
and i would be happy to help you do that .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how empfänglich people will be .
have you one perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; angle , &quot; because it has a negative konnotation -- but you know how this is going ?
how much money is required to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth to address some really familiar brands .
who knows when the movie comes out , we might see like a horde horde .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
the answer is not likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a tough thing about the film or a difficult thing for me ?
jk : both .
so , does not mean that optimistic .
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands are .
yeah .
if you look at the people you have to do it .
there are some places that we can turn .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera meant that we wanted to take a hintergrundgespräch .
it turned out that it was actually meant , &quot; we want nothing to do with your film . &quot;
and just so all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
none wanted to do something about the film .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising is to be able to present as many people as possible as possible , as many people can see .
especially in the world today , this intersection of new and old media and ancient media media , and the zerstückelten media media landscape -- is not the idea of being in this new exciting vermittlungsinstrument that brings up the masses .
no , that was what i thought .
but you see , the problem was that my idea had a fatalen mistake , and that was the following .
actually no , that was not the mistake at all .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
you see , if you &apos;re in transparency , you , this -- this -- this is one of the first images that appears .
i really like your kind , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- frei from deception and tücke , just to understand , characterized by sichtbarkeit , and access to information , especially what geschäftspraktiken -- the last line is the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re listening to a whole lot about transparency now .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes to this , it &apos;s going to be implemented , something changes .
but why ? well , transparency is einflößend -- like this strange bear that still brüllt .
it &apos;s unvorhersagbar -- like this strange landstraße .
and it &apos;s very risky .
what else is there ?
a whole bowl of cool food .
that &apos;s very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father caught my father on lying -- and he &apos;s looking at me with this look at -- he would say , &quot; my son , there are three versions of three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the true version . &quot;
so , you know , in this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there &apos;s only one company that was willing to help us -- and it &apos;s just because i &apos;ve been aware of john bond and richard kirshenbaum for years -- i found that i had to do it alone , i had to go to the mittelsmann and go directly to the companies .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that , when you start talking to these companies , the idea of your brand is a broad problem .
i have friends , the big , giant hollywood-filme , and i have friends who do little independent-filme as i do .
and my friends , the big , gigantic hollywood-filme , say that the reason why their movies are so successful in the markenpartnern that they have .
and then my friends , who are doing little independent-filme , &quot; well , how are we going to compete with these big , giant hollywood-filmen compete ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
so exactly what do we see in the movie ?
always , if i go to the way , and always , when i open the medizinschrank , you &apos;ll see ban .
and every time i interviewe somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you going to be here ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so maybe you should interview a little bit of this . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great düfte .
either floral fusion or &quot; paradise winds , &quot; you will have the choice .
we &apos;ll be equipped for both men and women for women , or stick , or stick , whatever .
that &apos;s the kurzfassung .
now i can answer all of your questions , and give you a ausfühliche version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand herausforderer .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so to make things like this -- you know , you know , people to ban -- that &apos;s kind of , why we &apos;re interested .
what would you describe to ban ?
ban is blank .
that &apos;s a great question .
überlegene technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone &apos;s doing under the achseln .
we &apos;re being bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes a positive positive , as opposed to fighting smell and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh fresh fresh fresh , three times , three times .
these things have an positivere effect .
and this is a millionen-konzern .
what about me ? what about druchschittstypen ?
i &apos;ve got to talk to the guy on the street , like me , otto-normal-verbraucher .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really love clothes .
&apos; 1980s , &apos; 80s , trifft , except on skaterpunk .
well , what is the brand gerry ?
unique .
i think the genre , the style that i have , is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of grautöne and such stuff .
but i usually have a accessoire , like sonnenbrillen , or a jewelry and such stuff .
if you would be a brand , if dan would be a brand , .
the brand is 2 : the brand that i am , i would say , lässige fly .
it &apos;s partly a woman 2 : partly hippie , partly brooklyn-mädchen -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i am the schmusetyp .
i sell schmusetiere throughout the entire country .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , verzerrten industry .
my brand is fedex , because i were ausliefere .
man 5 : brand gescheiteter schreiberling .
does this happen ?
attorney : i &apos;m a anwaltsmarke .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t be all the tom-marke , but i &apos;m often going to see the intersection of glamour and lässiger glamour and lässiger glamour .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could go into my head , someone who really could help me understand what you call the &quot; markenpersönlichkeit . &quot;
and so i found a company called olson zaltman in .
they have helped companies like nestle , febreze , hallmark , to discover these markenpersönlichkeit .
if you could do it to do it , you could help me .
you &apos;ve brought your pictures , right ?
i have that . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me just a little bit about how it is with your thoughts and feelings about it yourself .
these are the people who shape my worldview worldview .
tell me about this world .
md : this world i think the world &apos;s world is the world where you live -- how people are around one , the friends , the family , the way you live your life , the work and so .
all these things come from one place and start from one place to me , and they start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is this thinking and emotions about you yourself ?
it &apos;s like i would like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about &quot; why &quot; why &quot; why &quot; -- what does it bring us ?
what &apos;s the machete ? where do you have it right now ?
why is it important , neuzustarten ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about you , you &apos;re not .
what else do you go through ?
... it doesn &apos;t have to be scared . what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be made .
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their markenpersönlichekti have two separate separate , but sich pages -- the morgan spurlock-marke is a achtsame / verspielte brand .
these are very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction .
and i think some companies are going to focus on strength instead of both .
many companies tend to do -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re going to avoid fear , these elements , and they &apos;re welcome to them , and they turn them into something positive , and that &apos;s a geschickter schachzug .
what other brands are doing this ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can also see it here , target , wii , mini von and jetblue .
well , there &apos;s verspielte brands and achtsame brands , those things that come and go , but a verspielte , achtsame brand is a pretty powerful thing .
a achtsame , brand brand . how is your brand ?
if someone would ask them to describe their markenidentität , their markenpersönlichkeit , how would they be ?
you &apos;re an up-attribut ? are you something that &apos;s blood in wallungen ?
or are they more like a down-attribut ?
are you something that &apos;s a little quiet , more quiet ?
up-attribute are things that are playful , frisch , wie , abenteuerlich , abenteuerlich , ausgefallen , ausgefallen , ausgefallen , und , ausgefallen , ausgefallen , ausgefallen , profan , magisch , magical , magical and mystisch like gandalf .
or are they more like a down-attribut ?
are they mindful and mondän like 007 ?
are it being established , traditional , pflegend , beschützend , compassionate , like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , familiär , safe , geborgen , bedacht and weise like the dalai lama or yoda ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies and down-firmen and down-firmen and the &quot; no &quot; said &quot; no , &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they wanted to do nothing with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control of the finished product .
but it &apos;s going to be 17 markenpartner who were willing to get into this control with someone who wanted to do business with somebody who wanted to do business with someone like that , and to tell us to tell stories that we don &apos;t normally have had -- stories that we don &apos;t normally have to be able to tell .
they befähigten us to tell the story of neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this film , that you &apos;re used to be used today to be used to mris the lustzentren of the brain , for advertising , for advertising .
we went to sao paulo , where außenwerbung were banned .
in the entire city , for five years , there &apos;s no poster , no poster , no posters , nothing .
and we drove in school school where companies are going to their way into the temperate schools in all of america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most feedback , or where i had the greatest success , those are where i interacted with things directly .
and that &apos;s what they did .
because they umgingen the mittelsmann , they umgingen the agencies , and said that the agencies may not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate directly with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something people can challenge to think that our view challenges .
and what was that for you ? what do it succeed ?
now , since the movie was first in the sundance film festival , we can see this .
the burrelles burrelles was in january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million aufrufe from this film .
this is actually just a zeitraum period of two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film didn &apos;t leave yet .
it &apos;s not even online . no streaming .
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries yet .
now , the film ended up a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , where almost every werbeagentur that we talked to her clients to make the fingers of it .
what i firmly believe is that if you take ergreift your chance , taking risks in these risks .
i think if you keep people from it , then you get them closer to failure .
i believe that if you &apos;re trained your employees to avoid risk , you &apos;re prepared to get a profit on it .
i feel that we need to be encouraging people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear to have a lot of fear that they might verängstigen .
finally , we should welcome the fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
if you welcome the fear . you welcome the risk .
a great taste of the taste of that , so we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , a little bit more honest .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; you welcome transparency , &quot; came up with my good friends of emc that bezahlten $ namensrechte for the namensrechte for the namensrechte for the namensrechte .
big data will be transformed in the world for organizations around the world .
emc : &quot; you welcome transparency &quot;
thank you .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , what &apos;s happening right on the $ $ 7100 ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , put on the oberorganisation of the ted-organisation , the sapling-stiftung -- a check at a $ , to pay for my ted-auftritt in the next year .
my name is amit .
so 18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i &apos;m regte to do something with museums and art , my chefin , chefin , which is also the green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of spaßiger in negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very easy to explain with this slide and it .
i grew up in india .
i &apos;ve seen a great education -- i don &apos;t know -- i didn &apos;t -- but i had a lot of museums , and i had no access to this artwork .
when i went to visit these museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried to make this desire -- art -- to make art together with technology .
we set up a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
so you just go to googleartproject.com. too .
you can look around these museums here .
there &apos;s the uffizi , the moma , the hermitage , the rijks , the van gogh .
i actually come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you come in two of them -- very simple .
click , and wumms , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make a difference .
you go around and amüsiert .
they want to orient in the museum ?
open up the map , jump with a click .
they &apos;re in , they want to end up until the end of the gang .
just further . much fun .
through it .
thank you , but the best happens .
so i &apos;m in front of one of my lieblingsbilder , erntearbeiter of pieter breugel in the met .
i see this pluszeichen .
if the museum gave us the picture , click on it .
now this is one of the images .
this is all metadaten .
and those of you who really are interested in art can click here -- but i click that away now .
this is one of the images we captured with the so-called gigapixel-technologie .
for example , this picture is about 10 billion bildpunkte , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion bildpunkte ? &quot;
this is what i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can be very easy and rauszoomen .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unbezahlbar .
but then they want to get really deep in .
and so i started playing around , and found that there is something going there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close to , and slowly , slowly , that these kids actually suggested something .
i was making a little bit familiar with some known in the met with the met , and actually found out that it &apos;s a game called squail , where a duck was beaten at the fastnachtsdienstag with a stick .
it seems quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned something about it .
to get really close to , you can go to the rissen .
just to give you a sense of , i mean , you see what you get .
here we were , and this is painting .
but the best comes -- in a second .
let &apos;s quickly jump at moma , back in new york .
another lieblingsbild of mine , sternennacht .
and the previous example of the previous example was to find details .
but what if you want to see the pinselstriche ?
and what only happens when you want to see van gogh gogh this masterpiece ?
you get zoomed . you can actually go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom in one of my favorite parts of this picture until i &apos;m really rissen .
this is sternennacht , probably never seen that way before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is the really cool part , the collections of collections .
each of you , every one of them -- would be rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
they can go up and make their own museum online -- from all these images , they can use their own collection .
just simply , you go in -- and i created this , it &apos;s called the power of zoom -- you can umherzoomen .
that &apos;s the gesandten , in the nationalgallerie .
you can put everything on anmerkungen , send your friends , and so a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think finally , for me , the main thing that all the wonderful things don &apos;t come from google .
they come from the museums .
i might not say that .
they come from artists .
and this was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to do art with this digital medium of art and represent it properly .
what &apos;s the biggest question that is , &quot; did you do this to replicate the experience of a museumsbesuchs experience ? &quot;
the answer to this is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add up experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided in two camps .
this is the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the aptitute of every hemisphere , we could pose your brain .
for example , this would be someone who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be somebody completely intuitive .
now , where would you positionieren your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have chosen for one of these extremes , but i think that , for most people in the audience , their brain , for example -- with a high aptitute that is at the same time at the same time .
it &apos;s not as if you &apos;re both exklusiv or something like that .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i think of as one of the people , with most of the other experimental experimental quantenphysikern that need a good percentage of logic to put the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good share of intuition to actually perform the experiments .
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love playing it with things .
so we go out and play with it , and then look like it , and then we start developing our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing can be only in a place at the same time .
i mean , it can sound odd to think that one thing at the same time , in two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed it .
i remember having a child playing playing on a bodenschwelle .
he was still a toddler , and not very good at it , and he fell all the time .
but i bet that it taught him to teach a very valuable lesson , which was a very valuable thing , which is that the big things don &apos;t just leave you , and that you can stay in a place .
and this is a great konzeptionelles model in the world , so long they &apos;re not a teilchenphysiker .
it would be a terrible model for a teilchenphysiker , because they don &apos;t play with bodenschwellen , but with these little weird particles .
and if you play with your particles , imagine all kinds of odd things -- as you &apos;re flying directly through walls , or that you can be able to be in two different places .
and so they all wrote these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; it took quantum mechanics to describe the little , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the big everyday objects around us .
it didn &apos;t like my intuition , and it may not be just because i don &apos;t often play with particles .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but my logical page doesn &apos;t like it .
because if all of the things are made of particles and all these particles the rules of quantum mechanics , should not just follow all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see reason why it shouldn &apos;t be .
so i would feel clear to deutliche all the time , if we somehow , you can also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i got to do that a few years ago .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see , which was in the quantenmechanischen superposition .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see that green dot there in the middle there .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is an image of the object .
this is what i &apos;ll zoom up here . we &apos;re looking right here .
and here &apos;s a really very large close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s like a springboard , and it &apos;s above the edge .
so i did this thing in similar ways that you make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new siliziumscheiben , and rackerte for 100 hours to all the great devices .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this kind of a swimming pool pool and getting to the thing .
this thing has this thing has the ability to be able to be in the quantenmechanischen , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator alone , i do all kinds of weird things , but then i have other people growing up there , and i hear about all these things because i don &apos;t want to bother it , or , frankly , they &apos;re verschrecke .
quantum mechanics says that unbewegliche objects feel that same .
the mitfahrer objects are not just people , but also the light that seems to you and the wind that goes on you and the heat and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal , this piece of metal , we had to schmeissen all the mitreisenden .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we turned the light off , we put it out into a vacuum and saugten all the air and it kühlten it until almost now , in the elevator alone , in the elevator , was the piece of metal , to behave like always .
so we measured its movement .
we found that it &apos;s really strange .
instead , it &apos;s just silent , it &apos;s just silent , and the way it was vibrierte , the way that it was vibrierte -- like this -- like a ausdehnender and zusammen blasebalg .
in which we gave him a little push , we were able to vibrate at the same time and vibrate at the same time -- something only allowed in the quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what truly awesome .
what does it mean to vibrate for the same time , and vibrate to vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
so the first case : all the trillionen of atoms , all of those atoms are still there , and at the same time , the same atoms are moving up and down .
only to präzisen zeitpunkten voices .
the rest of the time are delokalisiert .
that means that every atom at the same time is two different places , which is at the same time , that the whole piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth this year in the green room , because , do you check that massstabsunterschied between one individual atom and that piece of metal is roughly the same as the difference between the piece of metal and it .
so if a single atom can be a single atom at the same time in two different places , can be able to be able to be able to be able to be this piece of metal in two different places ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine you &apos;re at the same time in several places , how would that feel ?
how would your mind deal with it that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
when we aufwärmten it , the light reinschauten , we saw the box , we saw that the piece of metal always was there in a piece .
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are actually just quanten objects that are together in a small room together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s still going deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the tiefsinnige and strange strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be rekonzeptualisieren as we think about economic development .
it should be our goal to be that if families are thinking about where they live and work , the opportunity to pick up between one hand full of different cities that are all facing in competition .
now we &apos;re far away from that goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t even have a single city that they would welcome to .
but the amazing thing about cities is that you &apos;re worth so much more than to build it .
so we could just einfach the world with duzenden , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now that may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought of new cities .
they just trade the construction of homes against the cities .
imagine , half of the people who are going to live in homes did this ; the other half didn &apos;t .
you could try to expand the capacity of the existing apartments .
but you know what you were going to be involved in , in these homes , and its environment , in those apartments and their environment , leading to beschwerden and abzulenken .
so it turns out that all these erweiterungen are very difficult .
but you could go to a completely new place to build a completely new block , assuming the law would be able to support this , and not behindern it .
so i proposed that governments are creating new areas that have enough space to a city and give them a name : charter cities .
i found out later , that , about the same time , javier and octavio about the challenge of reform .
they knew that every year around 75,000 honduraner left left their country , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same in honduras .
now , if we just put a message in our country &apos;s surface , what if we want to put a message on the canadian of our country , and when you want to work on the canadian rules , or you want to work out of the kanadischen of the united states , you can work there , and you can do anything on the surface of these messages , what do you usually have to go to canada or not ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , honduras suffered under a severe verfassungskrise .
in the next planmäßigen elections , pepe lobo would be gewann in a umschwung whose program promised both innovations and schlichtung .
he challenged octavio to become octavio .
in the meantime , i prepared myself a talk at tedglobal .
through improvement , test and through the study of consumers , i &apos;ve been trying to try to reduce this complicated concept of charter city to essentially reduce elements .
the first point is the importance of law , the laws of laws , you know , you know , that you already may not be charged .
we pay great attention to new technologies , but for progress , it requires technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually for common laws that we stop .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
and then he showed him javier .
and the two called me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country ! &quot;
so , in december , we met in december of a hotels in miami in miami .
i &apos;ve been trying to make clear how much more valuable cities they are than they cost .
and i used this graph to show you how the value is valuable to a place like new york , and think that a surface in some cases is worth thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it was quite an abstract discussion , at a place when there was a pause , said , &quot; paul , maybe we might watch the tedtalk . &quot;
so , in very simple shape , in very simple form , that a charter city is a place whose beginning is a gründungsvertrag city , which defines the laws of the laws that are there , and the people the opportunity to provide themselves is either under those rules or not .
that i was asked by the president of honduras , which meant that we need to realize this project that it &apos;s important , and that &apos;s the way to bring it to our land .
i was asked to come to tegucigalpa and take a talk again and hold a talk again .
so i &apos;ve given one more with facts of facts that have a graph like this , which has been to convince that if you want to make a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and this sketch the new airport , which was built in denver .
this airport alone has a surface of 100 quadratkilometern .
so i tried to convince the honduraner of them , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with at least 1,000 quadratkilometern .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand acres .
polite have all applaudiert .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and paying attention .
and the head of congress came to the stage and he said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and she played the tedtalk .
and i came to the punch line that a new city gives people new possibilities .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be around , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also includes new opportunities for leaders .
the leaders of the government on the government would depend on partnerländern , they could benefit from their partnerländern benefits that they can make the law for this charter for this charter and support that charter that everyone can trust that the charter is really durchgesetzt .
and the realization of president lobo was that the durchsetzung of the durchsetzung that i thought about as a way to get to be able to come to be able to get to build and to build this city , and be considered to build this city for all the parties that have been under fear and mistrust .
we went into an area .
this picture is from this place .
it works a thousand thousand kilometers .
and shortly after that , on the 19th of january , they were voted in the constitution for a constitution to have a verfassungsgemäße control that &apos;s special for special entwicklungsgebiete .
in a country that has just been a violent violent crisis , in which congress , for those verfassungsänderung to be elected to a voice .
all parties , all the rest of society , supported this .
to be part of the constitution , it has to be approved to be approved by congress twice .
on the 17th february , february , it was approved to be approved to a voice .
immediately after that choice , between the 21st and 24 of february , a delegation of about 30 trips to the two places in the world that were most interested in the world &apos;s business .
one place is south .
this is a picture of a large , new urban center built in south korea in south korea than the city bostons .
all you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get to preserve .
the other place that was very interested in the städtebau is singapore .
it &apos;s already built two cities in preparation , and the third is in preparation .
so if you basically think about this , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a baugrundstück , and they &apos;re starting to consider this area for the second city .
it &apos;s been working on a legal system that &apos;s been used to participate , and it will also work on a external law .
a country has already offered the supreme court to provide , as a court for the entgültige appeal of the system .
also städtedesigner and -bauer are very interested .
they actually bring funding in funding .
one thing you already know is , there &apos;s been a lot of mieter .
there are many of the businesses that like to put in america in america , especially in a place with a freihandelszone , and there are many people who &apos;d like to live there .
around the world , there are 700 million people saying they &apos;d like to live in a different place .
one million people left latin america a year and migrate into the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to leave their families , sometimes they have single mothers who have to make enough money to eat and feed .
unfortunately , it &apos;s sometimes children who try to find their parents again , in some cases , in some cases , haven &apos;t seen anything since a decade .
so , what is it for an idea to think about to build a whole new town ?
or even duzende of these cities , or hundreds of all around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to insist on it , that every family has a choice between multiple cities , in competition for new residents ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
for my friends for all my friends , thank you , thank you for ted .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
i recently did a poll with over 2,000 americans and the average number of choices , the angabegemäß of choices , is a typical american american day is 70. .
and also , a study was done with ceos recently that they saw the ceos .
and these scientists have just documented the different themes with whom that ceo has been engaged , and how much time they make decisions that relate to the issues .
and they found that an average ceo is working in the week with 139 tasks .
each of these issues was , of course , many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions have been hit within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions needed an hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions .
you know how many decisions you make in the nine minutes of category over the nine minutes of category across an hour ?
how good do you think they &apos;re dealing with the decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the greatest entscheidungsprobleme of our modern time , the entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to give you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise it , because i &apos;m blind , if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i &apos;m going to ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question for today is : are you ready to hear about the entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem ?
thank you .
when i was a abschlussstudent at stanford university , i went to that very exklusiven store ; at least then he was really exclusive .
it was a store called draeger &apos;s .
this business , it was almost like a vergnügungspark .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and essig and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we actually had leitungswasser .
i loved to go to this business , but at a time i asked myself , well , how does it come from you never kaufst ?
here &apos;s the olive gait .
they had about 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those that were embedded in boxes that came from a thousand years old .
so i decided to go to the leader of one day , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model that you really offer the people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed the busladungen of tourists of tourists every day , and usually had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose marmelade for our experiment .
here &apos;s your marmeladen gang .
they had 348 different kinds of marmelade .
we &apos;ve set up a little verkostungsecke at the entrance to the geschäfts .
we put out six different flavors of marmelade or 24 different flavors of 24 , and we have two things : first , what would more people be going to be there and marmelade ?
there are more people left , when it was 24 , about 60 percent when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what the people rather saw a glass of marmelade .
now we saw the opposite effect .
those people who were there when they were 24 , only bought three percent of them actually bought a glass .
and the people who stayed when they were six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of marmelade .
now , if you do the math , people bought six times more than a glass that they had six to choice when they had 24 .
now , not to buy a glass of marmelade is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem decisions are also influenced us with very profound decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide even if it &apos;s about our own best interests .
so the day that day are saving .
i &apos;m going to describe a study now that i was doing with gur , emir kamenica , wei jang , where we &apos;re doing decisions for retirement for almost a million americans from 650 plans in the entire united states .
and what we were looking at was whether the number of fondsangebote that you could have been able to be able to be able to do is to be saved , the 401 plan that is likely to be saved for tomorrow .
and we found that there was actually a relationship .
so in this plans , we had about 657 plans that have something between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund have been offered that , in fact , in fact , participation was lower .
now , if you look at the extremes of the extremes , the plans that offered the two fund , a teilnahmerate in the 1970s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that fast nearly 60 years , the teilnahmerate fell down to about the sechzigsten .
now , it turns out that even if you &apos;re to participate , even if you go to participate , if you &apos;re going to be able to be more possibilities , then , it has negative consequences , it has negative consequences .
so the people who chose to participate is more like the more possibilities they were available , the more vermieden they choose to choose to vote .
the more possibilities they were available to them , the more they put their money into pure geldmarktkonten .
none of these extreme decisions , belongs to the decisions somebody recommend people would recommend when their future matters .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential negative consequences that provide more and more choices .
they push the decision -- push on , even if it comes against their own interest .
they &apos;re more likely to make worse decisions -- worse resources and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re going to choose for things that they &apos;re less satisfied , even if they do objective better .
the main reason for this is that we might enjoy this huge shelves of mayonaise , mustard , essig and marmelade , but in fact , we don &apos;t actually compare the comparison to the comparison and then can actually take something out of that fantastic supply .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest today is that four simple simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in different ways , in different ways -- they can just apply them in their business .
first of all .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never been true as today that less is less .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; narrow . &quot;
they always worry about losing regalfläche .
but in fact , we see it more and more , if you &apos;re willing to be willing , and you &apos;re going to get rid of the unwichtigen gleichartigen possibilities , well , then there &apos;s a increase in sales , it &apos;s brought down the cost of the cost &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s a entscheidungswahrnehmung improvement .
as a proctor and gamble , the different head and shoulders species from 26 to 15 , they experienced a increase in sales by 10 percent .
when the golden cat corporation corporation , their 10 am sold their 10 katzenstreus , they experienced that the gains by 87 percent of the two , the result of the two , the rise of sales and reducing costs .
you know , the average supermakrt today is to give you 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart you have today offers 100,000 products .
but the neuntgrößte supermarket , which today is the neuntgrößte supermarket in the world , and they &apos;re just offering you 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce .
now in the world of sparens , i believe one of the best examples that have recently been on the market about how to do the choices , was something that david laibson has very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
every single harvard staff now takes a lebenszeitfond part of a lebenszeitfond .
anyone who really want to meet a choice , will not be 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to narrow it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the staff is , say , how are the possibilities of each other .
and if you can &apos;t auseinanderhalten your employees , your customers cannot . &quot;
now before we have lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said he said that he was willing to pay for all the people in this audience to bezahlten vacation vacation vacation to the most beautiful street in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i &apos;d like to read you .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read them , and i ask you to clap to you , if you &apos;re ready to say gary &apos;s offer .
okay . everyone &apos;s ready to adopt gary it .
are that everybody ?
okay , let me show you a little bit more about this .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i might have heard more hands .
good .
the fact that it &apos;s objective , when the first time you had more information than the second time , but i would have a car guess that you know the second time .
because the pictures made it really sense for you .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of entscheidungsüberlastung , it &apos;s the konkretisierung .
it &apos;s about people trying to understand the difference between possibilities , understanding the difference with the individual possibilities , and have to feel that the consequences are associated and specific .
why would people spend about 15 to 30 percent more , if you use a credit card or a credit card than in cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel money .
and it turns out that if you make something that feels very specific , it &apos;s a very good tool for people to save more .
so in a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero , we did a study with the people who have been working for ing -- employees who all worked for ing -- and these people were all signed in a meeting where they &apos;ve signed their participation for their rentensparplan .
and during this meeting , we &apos;ve just leave that end as it was , as it was , just as it was , we added one little .
the little thing we had to add was that we asked people to think of all positive things that would happen in their lives if they would save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was a rise in proportion to 20 percent , and there was a rise in the number of people who were willing to save or have a increase by four percent of the time they were willing to pay for the sparkonto .
third technology : kategorisierung .
we can deal with more categories than more choices .
here &apos;s for example , a study that we did in a zeitschriftengang .
it turns out it &apos;s in the wegmans supermärkten supermärkten , and the bottom in the northeast part of the number of magazines to 664 magazines .
but you know what ?
if i &apos;m going to give you 600 magazines , and i &apos;m going to show you in 10 categories , and you put them into 20 categories , you think that i have given you more choices and a better way , when i gave you the 400 of the 400 categories when i gave you 600 .
because the categories tell me how to keep it apart .
here are two different schmuckauslagen .
one is called jazz , and the other is called swing .
if you think that the left display is swing and the ad on the right , then you clap , then you clap into your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that the one on the left is jazz and that &apos;s on the right side , then you clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz and who on the right is swing , but you know what ?
this is a highly unnützes kategorisierungsschema .
the kategorien need to say something that is not providing the choice .
and the problem you see often , if you look at the long list of all this fund .
who do you want to inform them ?
my fourth technology : assumption for complexity .
it turns out we can be able to deal with more information than we think we have to simplify them .
we need to get the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german autohersteller who gives you the opportunity to provide your car completely .
they have to make 62 choices to make their car completely .
now , these decisions are different in the number of choices they make a decision .
autofarben , außenfarbe of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
what i do now is i change the order of the order of decisions .
half of the clients are going to be the number of possibilities , 56 autofarben to the small opportunities , four gears .
the other half of the clients are actually about the low possibilities , four gears , to the 56 autofarben , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how are they interested .
if you keep using the standardauswahl of the decision , that means they &apos;re being overwhelmed , the heisste , i &apos;m losing them .
what you &apos;re finding is that people who go from the most of the many to the low auswahlmöglichkteiten are always going back and over again .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to the many , then they do .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is the order of transforming this information .
when i start with the simple one , i &apos;m learning how to auswähle .
even though the gears choose , nothing about my preferences in the interior says it &apos;s still getting me to choosing .
and i &apos;m also excited about the big product that i &apos;m going to do , and so i &apos;m willing to get interested in that .
let me summarize it .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that is the problem of entscheidungsüberlastung -- will you go to the überflüssigen alternatives ; konkretisieren -- make it real ; tag it -- we can do better with more categories , to prepare for complexity .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m describing today is to help you manage the opportunity -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for people who are providing service .
because i think the key to best to the best to best is that you have a choice .
and the more we choose to choose , the better we will be able to make the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allocca , trends-manager on youtube . i look at youtube-videos .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are going to be viral , and then then that &apos;s why this is important .
we all want to be star -- celebrities , singer , comedians -- when i was young , it seemed like infinitely difficult .
but webvideos has enabled that we all , or all of our creative activities , can become a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to saturday saturday .
but on youtube , over 48 hours of video , more than a minute .
and again , there will ever have a tiny consequence of a tiny percentage and will look at thousands and thousands of times , and thousands of times .
so how does that work ?
three things : tastemaker , teilnahmecommunities and the unexpected .
well , then we want .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
woah !
ohhhhh , wowwww ! !
last year , sendete bear vasquez vasquez , this video he was photographed in front of his home national national national national park .
in 2010 , there was 23 million times before .
this graph shows what it looked like when the video was popular last summer for the first time .
really didn &apos;t want to make a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing that if you were to yosemite mountain bear .
he had uploaded a lot of naturvideos .
and this video was actually sent out in january in january .
what &apos;s happened here ? ?
there jimmy came .
jimmy kimmel : the tweet that the video ended up at the end of the end of the end .
because tastemaker wie , like jimmy kimmel , asking us new and interesting things , and show a big audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday &apos;s . gotta , get , get , everybody , friday , friday , friday , friday . gettin , gettin &apos; . her didn &apos;t think that we &apos;d run these conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
rebecca blacks &apos;s &quot; friday &quot; one of the top video of the year .
it was almost 200 million times this year .
this is what the chart looked like .
just like &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; double . &quot;
what happened in this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know it , these other tips are also freitage .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , tosh.0 gabelte , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael j. theater : theater &apos;s nelson theater theater for a first one to put on twitter about it .
the important thing is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a einnahm from a einnahm to a big audience , and accelerated the process .
and then these community of people formed that community who shared these big insiderwitz , and they started to talk too .
now there are 10,000 parodien of &quot; friday &quot; on youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a parodie for every single day of the day .
unlike the einseitigen conversation in the 20th century , the community is the community part of our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or doing something new from it .
&quot; nyan cat &quot; is animation and music in endlosschleife .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year , it became almost 50 million times .
and if you hold this for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a dreistundenversion that has been seen four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at their cats looking at this video .
important , the creativity that &apos;s in internetkultur and geeks and geeks and geeks .
there were remixe .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole remix-gemeinde shot out of the ground that made it from a stupid joke to something that we can all participate in .
now we don &apos;t just find pleasure on something , we do .
who could have all that anticipate ?
who could have predicted &quot; double rainbow &quot; or &quot; rebecca or rebecca cat cat ?
which drehbücher could write your writing , in which sort of drinsteht ?
in a world where every minute a minute , two days , it can only be really unique and unexpected hervorstechen like that mentioned video .
i &apos;m not interested in that , i &apos;m not interested in i was a friend who said i should look at this great video , i think about a guy who &apos;s in new york against bicycles .
i got a ticket because i got a ticket , because i &apos;m often gone on the radweg , but often there are disabilities who are not properly driving .
because that was completely surprising and humorous , casey niestats &apos;s fun idea and the argument five million times .
this approach is true for everything we do creative .
and all of that leads us to a big question ...
what does that mean ?
ohhhh .
what does that mean ?
tastemaker , creative teilnehmergemeinden , completely unexpected , are the features of a new way of media and culture that has to have access to each access to the audience .
as i said , one of the largest stars -- justin bieber -- justin bieber his beginning .
nobody has to give your ideas green light .
and today , we &apos;re all feeling as a owners of our culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they &apos;re hardly as much to the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how do i talk about the connectedness between women about 30 years ago , when she was in 10 minutes ago , when she was sitting in a little boat in the chinese sea , and one of the connectedness that lived in the lives of this little little girl and never disappeared -- this little girl who lives now in san francisco in san francisco ?
the story is not over yet .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s going to be put together .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzlestückchen .
imagine the first piece : a man who is burning his work .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life of unity of unity and freedom of home was held together .
think of it in the einmarsch of the kommunisten in saigon , how he must admit that his life was a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , are now his own .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never have forgotten his life .
i had to make sure that it was not for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to zerdrücken us , but it &apos;s gone .
the next puzzleteil shows , like a boat in the early morgenrot , ausläuft at sea .
my mother may be 18 when her father died -- already in a arrangierten marriage , with two little girls .
for her had a problem for her : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that it might fail .
after a couple of four and filmreifen , a boat still a boat on the lake fischerboot .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the greatest fear of pirates , the rape and death .
as most adults on the boat , my mother was wearing a little giftflasche .
if you had a gefangennahme , i &apos;d just had my sister , and i drink my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the connected tuckern of the engine , the klatschen of a wave on the front , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that many times came , but from the todesmut of the men täuschen on our boat täuschen , or the engine of the engine , who didn &apos;t want to start six hours .
but i remember the lights on the coast of ölplattform , and the young man , the collapsed and the young man , and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and at the taste of the first apfels that gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple tasted that way again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next puzzlestück is about four women in three generations who are building a new life together .
we put ourselves down in footscray , a vorort vorort in footscray , and the population of immigrantenschichten vorort .
unlike the alteingesessenen mittelklassevororten that was completely unknown to me , it was not in .
the smells of ladentüren came from the rest of the world .
and the fetzen gebrochenen were brought in between people who have been one thing in common : they started neu .
my mother was working on farms , then on one line in a autofabrik , six days , twice , six layers .
you couldn &apos;t have time to find the time to get english and it-qualifikationen .
we were poor .
every dollar has been given , and it was delivered in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do for it , and mostly the new things were coming out of the second hand .
two strümpfe for school , every one in order to cover those holes .
eine to the knöcheln , because she had to reach six years .
and there were the rare but the rare , painful , painful von , and here and there &apos;s wandmalereien , &quot; asian , &quot; asian , goes home . &quot;
go home ?
something versteifte in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and we heard the movements of our grandmother &apos;s movements .
my mother suffered from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until their alpträume came to get her alpträume .
she opened up a computergeschäft , then made a kosmetikerausbildung and opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t change the change , angry and unflexibel , and sorgenerfüllte children , trapped between two worlds .
loans and sponsor .
centers were built .
i lived in parallelwelten .
in one , i was the classic asian student , the unerbittliche demands of itself .
in the other , i &apos;ve been involved in uncertain life , who were carrying the tragic scars of violence , and the isolation of isolation .
but so many received over the years .
and because of this aid , i became auserwählt as a young year of jurastudiums as a young australierin .
and i was katapultiert from a puzzlestück to the next , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous bewohnerin of footscray , was now tan le , refugee and social activist who was invited to speak in places that she never heard about , and housing , in housing , whose existence could never have imagined .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the etikette .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the besteck .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to routine and my lebens of life -- a grandmother , and a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , every day in their days , for the last twenty years , by telling each other stories of day , and einschliefen , we &apos;re still three still in the same bed .
i told my mother , i would not do that .
and she reminded me that i was so old , when we climbed the boat .
no , never was an opportunity .
&quot; you just said , &quot; she said , &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about jugendarbeitslosigkeit and education , and the neglect of marginalisierten and entrechteten .
and the more i spoke , the more i should tell .
i met people in all lebenslagen , so many of you did what they loved , lived in the limits of the possible .
and even though i graduated from my degree , i realized that i couldn &apos;t go to my career in the classroom .
there had to be another puzzlestück .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a außenseiter , neu , new in the picture -- not just all right , but something you have to be grateful , maybe a gift of boots .
because dazuzugehören can be so easy to collapse , as easy as easy , you know , you can mean the assumptions of the environment .
now i &apos;ve gone out of my bequemlichkeitsbereich to know that , yes , the world auseinanderbricht , but not as you do it .
possibilities not allowed to be explicitly encouraged .
there was a energy , an unerbittlichen optimism , a strange mixtur of the humility and the wagnisses .
so i followed my gut gut .
i collected a little team of people around me , which is not a unwiderstehliche challenge .
for a year we didn &apos;t have a dime .
at the end of one bed , i was cooking a huge jar of soup that we shared .
we were working late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant , and we made the breakthrough .
i made the decision to make the u.s.
just a trip there .
my gut gut again .
three months later , i moved and the adventure went .
before i show the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time where the social norm and the local mandarin were the most important person was .
life had not changed since centuries .
her father died shortly after birth .
her mother moved her alone .
with 17 she was told the second woman who had her mother schlug her mom .
and with no support with the support of her husband , brachte it for a sensation by brought it to the court and anklägerin it in their own case , and another more sensation when she won .
&quot; not proved to be unwahr . &quot;
i just duschte in a hotel room in sydney , when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the duschtrennwand and saw them on the other side .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
my mother called me a few minutes later .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in footscray and sat around her sarg .
we told her stories and versicherten , that we were still with her .
at midnight , came the monk and said he said he had to close to the sarg .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because they &apos;ve hold it for this morning , he said .
&quot; they don &apos;t catch them . &quot;
if there is a band in our family , it &apos;s going through the women .
you see who we were and how life has shaped us , we can see that the men who might have come into our lives would have come to our lives .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i think about the boat .
who ever would a wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , ease , vor .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous every wave of trotzt , the unbeirrte , connected tuckern of the engine , the long horizon that guarantee nothing ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could do this , and i could make it safe , i would do it .
another mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother today is in the fourth or five .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it even photography ?
because , of course , this is a picture you can &apos;t absorb with your camera .
and yet my interest in photography started when i received my first digital camera at the age of 15 years old .
i put it in my former predilection for drawing , but it was a little bit different , because when the camera is using the camera , the camera was actually in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you press the trigger .
so , for me , photography seemed to be more likely to go to the right place at the right time .
i believed , everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts in the process when the trigger is going to trigger .
photos like this : a construction site along a much befahrenen road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and yet , there &apos;s a realistic level .
or photographs like this -- dark and farbenfroh at the same time , but everyone with the common goal to keep a realistic level .
if i say reality , i mean foto-realität .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can actually capture , but i always want to make it look like you could have this .
photographs where you have to think about a moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more likely to capture an idea than a moment .
but what &apos;s the trick that it makes realistic look realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what realistic is , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality , where you can take different pieces and put it together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect vorstellbare physical objects that we can all identify with in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , you can create something that &apos;s still three-dimensional as if it could exist .
but at the same time we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so , we überlisten our brains , because our brains simply don &apos;t make sense of it .
and i see the same process in combine by photographs .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because they just look kind of wrong .
so i would say there are three simple rules to obey a realistisches outcome .
as you can see , it &apos;s not three special images .
but then you can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined together has the same perspective .
secondly , have combined the same beleuchtungsart combined .
and these two pictures meet these two demands -- they shot from the same altitude and the same .
third is that it &apos;s going to be able to tell you where the individual images and end up by connecting it seamlessly .
it makes it impossible to say how this photograph was actually put together .
so , in the edges of color , contrast to the individual images , like feldtiefe , , like feldtiefe , entsättigte colors and disorders , we verwischen the boundaries between the different images , and let &apos;s look like a single photograph , even though a picture can basically contain hundreds of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a landscape , and the bottom one is manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely composed , from photographs of different places .
i personally finde. that it &apos;s easier to create place a place than a place , because you don &apos;t have to make any compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i got this idea in the winter , i knew that i needed several months to make them plan to find them , to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been taken on a anglerausflug .
the bank comes from another place .
the unterwasser-teil comes from a quarry .
and yeah , i even have the house up on the island of red umgefärbt to make it look like .
to achieve a realistisches outcome , it &apos;s going on from me in planning .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s all very well planned .
and if you make good footage , the result can be quite realistic , and also quite realistic .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that are limited to us is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic gesundheits-projekte fail .
and i think the most important thing is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we &apos;ve introduced to the radboud-universität was a haupt-zuhörer .
and this is not particularly science -- she puts a cup of coffee or tea and asks the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how are it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everyone -- maybe most of the electronic gesundheits-projekte fail , because we stopped listening .
this is my wlan-waage . a very simple thing .
she has a button .
and i get to this morning .
and yeah , i have a job as you might recognize .
i &apos;ve got my job at 95 pounds .
it works very simple : every time i get to the scale , it also brings my data on google health .
and they &apos;ll also be able to see where it can recognize where my gewichtsproblem is , and it &apos;s not only in the moment that i need to support or something like that , but in a view of the past .
but there &apos;s another thing .
maybe it &apos;s known to you , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 follower on twitter .
so every morning i jump to my wlan-waage and people talk to me before i &apos;m in the car , &quot; well , for lunch , just a little lettuce , a little lettuce today , lucien . &quot;
but this is the netteste , which can happen , because this is the gruppenzwang , gruppenzwang , to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could take patients smoking .
but it could be used to get people out of their chairs , and to get them together in common some kind of play in order to control their health .
next week , it comes to the market .
there will be this little blutdruck-messgerät that you &apos;ll give you to an iphone or so anschließt .
and it will enable people to measure their blood pressure , send him to their own physician and share him with others , for a little more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients come in . they can &apos;t just take over the control of their own ship , but we can help health care for health care with the challenges that are in front of us , and the kostenexplosion of health care , double demand , and so on .
so what you do is that you &apos;re making it easy , and start using it to hug patients in the team .
and you can do that through methods , but also by crowdsourcing .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done , i &apos;d like to share with you with a quick video .
we all have navigationssysteme in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all atm machines are around maastricht .
we know , we know where every gas stations .
and sure , we can find fastfood-ketten .
but where would the next aed to help that patient ?
we have herumgefragt , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next life-saving aed was in this moment .
so what did we do ? we conducted in the netherlands .
we set up a website and a menschenmasse asked , &quot; if you see a book , please share with us where it is , when he &apos;s on , &quot; because sometimes it &apos;s closed during geschäftszeiten , of course .
and over 10,000 aeds have been reported in the netherlands in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for it .
and we have designed a ipad-app .
we have developed an app for layar , augmented reality to find these aeds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like maastricht and someone goes down , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , you can also be able to find the next couple of aed that life can save lives .
and at the end of today , we don &apos;t just want to do that as a aed4u , how the product is called the product , but also , as aed4us .
and we want to bring this on a worldwide level .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , from other universities , about helping us behave like knotenpunkte , to crowdsource these aeds all over the world .
and if you &apos;re on vacation and you &apos;re going to collapse , it &apos;s your own verwandtschaft or somebody else , you can find a aed .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies are helping us all help us in the world &apos;s bestätigung .
these could be kurierdienste , or technicians , for example , just to make sure that the gemeldete aed is still in its place .
please help us do it , and try to improve the health of your health , not only better improve , but take your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in solartechnologie-branche .
and my little startup wants to force ourselves to the environment by forcing us ...
... put it to crowdsourcing .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
oh . a moment .
maybe it &apos;s geladen until it geladen .
now -- we can just jump it -- i &apos;ll just skip the video instead ...
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
solartechnologie is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to get back to a year and work in an environment that is pretty much everything they actually hate , we have them work in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like friedenscorps for geeks .
we choose a few fellows every year , and we let them work with stadtverwaltungen .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in rathäuser .
and they developed a great apps , working with urban employees .
but what they really do is to show what &apos;s possible to do with technology today .
so you meet al .
al &apos;s a hydrant in the city boston .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking at a date , but what he really seeks is , someone who &apos;s looking at it , when he &apos;s eingeschneit , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good at brandbekämpfung when he &apos;s zugedeckt by a meter of snow .
how did he come to look for this particular way to help ?
we had a team of fellows last year in boston as part of the code for america for america .
they were in february of february , and it has a lot of geschneit .
and they realized that the city never hydranten this fire fire .
but one particular fellow fellow , a man named erik michaels-ober , he noticed something else , and that was that people who are free to teilen , right in front of these parts .
so he did what any good engineers would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire fire .
you stimmst to schaufeln , if it schneit .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a humble small app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that wrote fellows the fellows last year .
but she &apos;s doing something no other regierungstechnologie .
it &apos;s expanding fast .
there &apos;s this guy in the i.t. museum of the city , which has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but to adopt citizens tsunami-sirenen .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami-sirenen work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to clean gullys gullys .
and chicago has just been introduced for people to freischaufeln the buergersteige when it schneit .
we now know nine cities , planning to use this app .
and she verbreitet verbreitet , of course , organisch .
if you know about regierungstechnologie , you know , it doesn &apos;t usually happen .
the beschaffung of software takes a few years .
we had a team that worked last year on a project last year in boston and two months .
it went to a way to find out with the parents who are the right public school for their children .
we were told later , when it was about the normal canals , it would cost over two years and it would cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
there &apos;s a project at the moment in the california law that cost two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so , an app that is written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading from selbt , it &apos;s a shot in front of the front , the institution , the institution .
it shows how government could work better -- no longer like a private company , how many people think it should be .
and not even like a technik-unternehmen , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free to open access , open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , this app is that it represents a new generation that &apos;s the problem of government anpackt -- not as the problem of an verknöcherten institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out that we &apos;re very good in the collective action in the digital technology .
now there &apos;s a great community of people who have the tools that we need to build things effectively .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country to get up and schreiben , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re awful frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they fix them .
and these guys know something that we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s what happens to all your feelings about politics and all the lines of the arbeitsamt and all the other things that we really upset about is government , in the core , in the words of tim o reilly , &quot; what we do in together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
a lot of people today gave up the government .
and when you &apos;re one of those people , i ask you , you know , you know , because things change .
politics isn &apos;t changing ; the government is in change .
and because the government ultimately takes its power out of us -- erinner you , &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think it will affect how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know much about the government when i started this program .
and as a lot of people , i thought that the government is mainly about choosing people in office .
now two years , after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s especially in local communities .
this is the call for service and information .
you usually get out there when you in your city in your city .
if you &apos;ve ever had an opportunity to work in your business call , like the fellow scott silverman , as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re going to see that people , you know , the government , the government , for many different problems , including a beutelratte in your house .
so scott gets this anfruf .
he type &quot; beutelratte &quot; into the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the tierfänger .
and finally he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and see a very loud music and see if the livestock is abhaut ? &quot;
and that worked . and that worked . for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the beutelratten .
the boston is not just a call center .
it has an app , a web- and handy-app , called citizens connect .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is work very smart people in the office of the new urban mechanics in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- it came in : &quot; beutelratte in my mülltonne . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens with &quot; citizens connect &quot; is different .
scott unterhielt unterhielt from man .
but on &quot; citizens connect &quot; is all public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , there was a neighbor .
and the next point that we got was , &quot; i went over there , found the mülltonne behind the house .
beutelratte ? yes . alive ? yap .
turned to the site . went home . went home .
nice night , cute beutelratte . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . here &apos;s the digital that digital is the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is in crowdsourcing .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i mean not necessarily a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m talking more about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped a different citizen , but the government used to play a central role .
it connected these two people .
and you could have been able to connect them to state service , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to state services .
if a neighbor helps another , we empower our communities .
let &apos;s call the tierfänger , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is we need to think about this is that government is not the same as politics .
and most people do that , but they think this is one of the other input .
that our contribution to the system is that .
how often we chose a political leader -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we reject ourselves , and we expect the government to reflect our values and share our needs , and then not much changed a lot ?
that &apos;s because the government , as a further ocean , and politics are the top 15cm .
and what &apos;s below is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt , the thing we own , that we have , and we &apos;re paying something that we &apos;re paying for , which is working against us , and then we entmachten ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy .
because that &apos;s where the actual regierungsarbeit is happening .
we need to get to the machinery of government .
so the occupythesec-bewegung has done it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of sexual citizens who wrote a very detailed 325-seitigen report , which is an answer to the sec-memo of the gesetzesvorlage to the finanz-reform .
this is not politically active , which is bürokratisch active .
well , for those of us who gave up the government , it &apos;s time to think about the world we want to leave our children .
you have to think of the enormous challenges you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we have to reach what we have to do without improving an institution that can be in the name of us all ?
one government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the role of the government is fundamentally able to achieve umzudeuten in a way that it can possibly achieve something by doing the society .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown up mitdem internet , and who knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things , you have to do just build systems properly .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that had grown up to see her voice for granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this fight , which we all fight to talk about who are talking to .
you might think of your mind , on every channel , and you do it .
so , if you get confronted with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the work of the government .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be , a little bit of hydranten , unkraut , can turn to turn to turn around .
and sure , we would have this little fire all the time freischaufeln , and many people do this .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers who receive taxes and receive taxes .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we won &apos;t improve the government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i ask you all here is : if it &apos;s about the big , important thing that we have to do together , everyone together , we will only be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
and i was like , because i &apos;m here in my friends to tell people how wonderful the new technologies that are going to be , i &apos;m going to tell you what i really think . and also to look back and understand what &apos;s really going on here , with these incredible sprüngen , in the front of which so quickly happens that we can &apos;t keep up with it .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a little boring slide .
... could you just just show the slide .
this is a slide that i happen to be picked out of my folder .
this is not about the details of the slide , but rather about the general form .
this slide shows a analysis of a analysis of processors compared to increasing processors compared to the performance of an local area .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like several others , which we find often in our field , is a kind of just a semi-logarithmischen curve .
in other words , every step here is equivalent to a potency in leistungsskala .
and this is a novelty that we need to use this guy to scale curves in the field of technology .
something very strange here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the lights back .
again , because i &apos;m going to draw a little bit more on paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in technology on semi-logarithmischen curves ?
the reason for that i would draw it on a regular curve , where , say , this is the years , the timeline of a way , and this is an arbitrary amount of the technology that i want to show with a graph , you &apos;ll be silly .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a transporttechnologie , then it would be very unvernünftig in the semi-logarithmischen , in the form of a flat line , in the form of a flat line .
but if something like this is happening , this is changing circumstance .
so if the transporttechnologie were going to be fortschreiten , then we could go into a taxi and go in 30 seconds , we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
there was never before in the history of technologie-entwicklung , that kind of rekursivem growth , which is increasing all the order of the scale all the years .
the question that i want to ask you now is , if you look at this exponential curves , you can &apos;t go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that it all over and forever as quickly as it evolved .
there are two options .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic s-kurve , like here , up to something completely new , or it will happen here .
it &apos;s about it .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going on .
it &apos;s really , that means we &apos;re right now in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here in this line , in a transition from the past world to a new kind of world .
so the question that i want to ask is , and i also often want to ask myself , is this new world ?
what &apos;s this new state that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing when you &apos;re in the middle .
when i was a kid , the future was somewhere in the year 2000 , and people were often talking about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
on further than that we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future has shrunk every year since i was in the world .
i think the reason for this is that we realize that anything is happening .
the transition happens . we can all feel .
and we know that there &apos;s just no sense to try 30 or 50 years to see the future , because it &apos;s going to be so different that it &apos;s going to be a simple hochrechnung from what we &apos;re doing now .
now , i want to talk about what that might be , that we &apos;re in today .
so , to make this first , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that don &apos;t have anything to do with technology or computers .
because i believe in order to really understand this , we have to step back and look at the thing on a longer zeitskala .
so i want to look at this on the zeitskala of the earth &apos;s life .
i think a big picture makes sense if you split it into some milliarden-schritte .
so let &apos;s go back and go back , 2.5 billion years , the earth was a big , steriler steinklumpen with lots of chemicals .
now , if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture about how they &apos;re anstellten .
i also believe there are theories that are starting to understand how everything works with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little story of what is that that &apos;s that time , that at this time , at this time , little öltröpfchen herumschwebten , which had different kinds of rezepten for chemicals .
some of these öltröpfchen held a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and to grow .
all of those started , started .
these little öltröpfchen were in the sense of primitivste zellenform .
but they weren &apos;t going to be about living about life in today , because each one of them was just a little , zufälliges prescription of chemicals .
and every time it divided , these chemicals have befindlichen chemicals distributed to disparate volumes .
so each one was a little bit different .
in fact , the tröpfchen , which one of the one for growth has added composition faster than others and integrated , and more chemicals from the outside and divided themselves faster .
so this tends to survive longer , and they increase themselves in grösserem ways .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but it &apos;s going to be more interesting if this tröpfchen is a trick about abstraction .
in any way that we don &apos;t really understand , this is the ability to learn from information niederzuschreiben information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell , which is in a particular chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , you have found this geistlosen , evolutionary , evolutionary way that allowed you to figure out what you were allowed to do , as that information was stored and copied .
the amazing thing about it is that this kind of information is about the time of a 2.5 billion years in which it was born .
in fact , the recipe for us is the recipe for us , which is the exact same code and the same notation .
and that is the exact same letter and the same code .
we &apos;re as far as we are , just to vergnügungszweck , in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 mikrogramm of a white pulvers that i try to keep in the airports of sicherheitspersonal .
in it -- what i did is , i took this code -- the code is made of normal letters , which we use for the symbolisieren -- and i wrote my visitenkarte on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve written it 10 ^ 22 .
so if you want a hundred million copies of my visitenkarte , i have enough for everyone in this room and even for everybody in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was in fact a egoist , i would have had a virus , i would have written them on a virus , and put them in the room .
so what is the next step ?
the dna niederschreiben of dna was an interesting step .
and the veranlagten of these cells -- made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and so these cells began to communicate and share information , so that communities were born by cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
this is why the consistency is growing up to antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how they can stay from penicillin , and they combined with other bacteria with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because the bacteria communicate with each other .
now , communication allowed the reasons of community , which in some sense were the same boat ; they were synergetisch .
so they &apos;re either living together , or they went together . that meant that , if a community was successful , all the individuals who prefer the community more often and evolution by evolution .
now the übergangsstelle is now where these communities are so close to , that they decided to write , the recipe for the entire community to write on the dna .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
at that point , we have mehrzellige communities mehrzellige communities , communities of zellentypen , which together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a mehrzellige community .
we have a lot of cells that have no longer questioned .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells , and so on .
so these communities started out , so the level , the level that evolution was happening , no longer the individual cell , but the whole zellengemeinschaft that we call the organism .
the next step is within these communities .
the zellengemeinschaften began to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures that do nothing else to do as information within the information .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the informationsverarbeitungsapparat that have built these zellengemeinschaften .
they started to train specialists inside the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and festhalten information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point an individual -- learning happened within the period of a single organism , instead of over this evolutionary period .
so an organism could learn to eat a certain fruit , not to eat , because she did bad and made it sick , last time he ate her .
now , this could be done within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because this information is evolutionarily learned from the individuals who died because of these fruit , they were still not there .
so the nervous system has the evolutionsprozess using this particular thing , because evolution could now take place within an individual .
it could happen within a time of lernrahmens .
what happened after that was the individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
for example , as an example , the raffinierteste version of the human language is the human language .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , unordentliche , unordentliche idea in my head .
i &apos;m actually sitting here , and i basically took notes of notes from myself to create a similar verwirrte idea that verwirrte idea in your mind that has a kind of similarity with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , and we turn it into sound , a sequence of sound , and producing something very complicated in the head of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually have done , we know , humanity , is we started abstract .
we go through the same stages that have gone through the mehrzellerorganismen -- the abstraction of our methods , as we &apos;re presenting data , to process .
the invention of language was a little step in that direction .
telefonie , computers , videobänder , cd-roms , and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to handle this information .
and it connects us all to something that is much bigger , and also able to develop faster than we were .
so nowadays , evolution can happen in the period of mikrosekunden .
you also saw the tys little evolutionsbeispiel , where he showed a little bit of evolution in &quot; convolution &quot; program , right in front of your eyes .
so , we have verschnellert again .
the first steps of history , which i told you , dauerten a billion years .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
then the nächstens steps , like language and so on , less than a million years .
and those next steps , like electronics , seem to take only a few decades .
the process is feeding itself from itself , and it &apos;s going to be , i think , auto-katalytisch is the word for it -- if something more verstärkt .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explosionsartigen curve curve .
we see the process that feed themselves .
i live living by building computers , and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism i use to build computers , not using the computer , without using any nuclear progress in computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design these in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every transistor is doing in verbindungsmaschine .
it has billions of those .
what i do instead , and what i do instead of the designers , is we think of a abstraktionsebene , and that we think of this machine , and this machine , and the machine makes something that way beyond that , better and faster than we could ever do it themselves .
and it &apos;s partly about the methods that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
a method which is particularly interesting , which i &apos;ve been using most recently , is evolution .
and this is what we put in the machine , in the machine , in the machine .
to give an example , in the most extreme cases , we can make a program a program that &apos;s random from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , generiere , please , give a hundred million randomly chosen sequences of instructions .
please , please , please join elected instructions , lead all of the programs , and then finally pick the ones that i &apos;m going to talk about . &quot;
so in other words , i first define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i &apos;ve sort of numbers , that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve been using that .
so , find programs that can place the numbers .
of course , a chance of course , the chance at random instructions are very small that they sort of sort of different numbers , so i don &apos;t think the instructions to do this .
but one of them may be two numbers in the right order of order .
now , i say , &quot; computers , can now take those 10 percent of the sequence of the dna sequences .
store this down , lösche the rest .
now reproduziere all the übriggebliebenen who have the numbers in the best sortiert .
and this is with a method of rekombinierens , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their subroutinen , and the children are making the characteristics of the characteristics of two programs .
so i &apos;ve got a new generation of programs that come up with combinations of programs that have come to policies .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
bewerte them again .
maybe lead some mutations .
and try it again with another generation .
all of these generations need a few milliseconds .
and so i can run through evolution in a few minutes , or in more complicated cases , in more complicated cases , some hours .
and finally , i get programs that can make numbers perfectly accurate .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i &apos;ve ever had to write by hand .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t say how they work .
i tried to understand you .
it &apos;s verworrene and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , and i &apos;m sure they do the job , because they come from a series of hunderttausenden programs that have done done .
because your life depended on whether you did the job right .
i sat at a 747 with marvin minsky , ale minsky , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at that .
it says , &apos; this aircraft is made out of hunderttausenden kleinteilen , who work together to make your flight safer . &apos; doesn &apos;t do it ? &quot;
we know that a entwicklungsprozess is not optimal when it becomes too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers , for a process which is very different from classical engineering engineering .
it allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than the normal methods would allow us to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibility of this yet .
so gewissermassen überflügelt gives us technology .
we use these programs now to make the computer much faster , so that we can do that processes even faster .
so it creates a rückkopplung .
it &apos;s faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies today are feeding themselves .
we go up .
we &apos;re at one point that is analogous to the time that einzeller-organismen evolved to be developed .
so we &apos;re the amöben , and we can &apos;t even make sure what the hell we &apos;re actually creating here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this übergangpunkt .
but i really believe that after us .
i find it very hochmütig from us to say that we are the end of evolution .
and i think all of the creation here are part of the creation of whatever is next .
now , the lunch message before , and i think i &apos;m going to hear , before i &apos;m going on .
my story begins right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert in the desert with sufi-sänger mukhtiar ali .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the time of the ancient indian epos mahabharata . &quot;
if we were indians at the time , we went to a car and schwirrten over the sky .
now we &apos;re doing airplanes .
at the time , when the great indian kriegerprinz durst thirst had , he took a bow , shot into the soil and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with bohrern and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that made me sad .
i was getting some scared of technology .
i &apos;m scared that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without a tweet , without tweet , with my friends .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silberne taschenuhr .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the magischste thing for me .
it became a goldener access to a world full of pirates and verunglückter ships and to images in my imagination .
it came to me as holding our fancy clocks clocks &apos;s clocks &apos;s clocks .
they would be inspired by us .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic instead of killing magic .
by 16 , i started illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling that can connect readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it brings images and text together , and animation , sound and touch .
that storytelling is more senses .
but what do we do with this ?
i just go to khoya , an interactive ipad app .
here says , &quot; don &apos;t make your fingers on any light . &quot;
and so -- here -- here &apos;s this box here -- &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to be a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows , with gps , where i live -- it &apos;s really about me addressiert .
the child in me is really excited about this possibility .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean to do a magician and dragons , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies , in a glass , in a jar of glass .
so you have to blow up the ipad and rauslassen your fireflies .
and that &apos;s the way through the whole book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can be in a single murmel .
and so , here &apos;s going to be a little book , and every world is a little bit of murmel a little bit , which i &apos;m looking down here to the magic device .
and this opens up a map .
fantasybücher had always maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows and lights up , in the rest of the book .
she also shows other places in the book .
i &apos;m going in here .
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is indisch , but very zeitgemäß .
these are the apsaras .
we &apos;ve all heard of feen and nymphen , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the apsaras ?
the poor apsaras were caught in indras chambers , in an old muffigen book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary history of children .
a story related to new issues , like the umweltkrise .
the theme of the last 10 years of the last 10 years is that kids are sitting in their homes , in their computers without .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;ll go out to a search . you &apos;ve got to go out and see with the camera of the ipads of natural objects .
as a kid , i had collections of stöckern , rocks , kieseln and muscheln .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do anymore .
this is going to be zurückgebracht . you need to go out to go out in one chapter a picture of a flower and tag .
in another chapter , you have to have a piece of baumrinde fotographieren and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can get online online .
a kid in london shows a picture of a fuchses and says , &quot; oh , today i saw a fox . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey today . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
there is a variety of ways that connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning a interaction where you &apos;re using the video of the ipads , and through augmented reality , you see an animation that looks at a plant on a plant in the house .
at a place to fill on the screen .
you have to do the sound of the winds , throw it away and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the nature of the technologies are closer and in the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children to the natural world , and we get closer to the magic , fun and fun of our childhood by the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really a very extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in untersuchungshaft , prisons or todeszellen .
i spend most of my time with the social weakest in the sozialbausiedlungen and places where there is a lot of hopelessness .
here at ted , looking and hearing , how stimulating this is , has given me a lot of force .
in the short time here , i realized one : ted has an identity .
you can say things that have influence worldwide .
and sometimes , if something about ted , it &apos;s meaning and force that it wouldn &apos;t have otherwise .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher &apos;s words have meaning , but the words of a dedicated teacher is particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , you can do better .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional afroamerikanischen household that was dominated by a matriarchin , and that matriarchin was my grandmother .
she was a taffe , a strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every familienstreit .
it was also the origin of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a sklavenfamilie .
their parents were born in the 1840ern in virginia as slaves .
it was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a little boy , she came up to me and umarmte me .
she pushed me so that i could barely breathe . then she made me go .
one or two hours later , when i came across her , she came up to me and said , &quot; bryan , you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and when i said no , she umarmte me again . if i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she made me quiet .
in her was something that made you want to be close to her .
the only problem with that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of their 10 children .
sometimes if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins walked around everywhere .
i remember , i have to woke up eight or nine , i woke up one morning and went into the living room , all my cousins walked around .
my grandmother was at the end of the zimmers and staring at me .
first i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and smiles , but she looked very seriously .
it was like 15 or 20 minutes . then she stood up and came over to me . she took me in the hand , and she said , &quot; come on . you and i , you have to talk . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
i never forget it .
she took me out , and she said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you &apos;re not weitersagst . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; ehrenwort ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down , and i looked at it . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me only three things . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , first of all , you &apos;re going to be love to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby and you have to promise you that you &apos;re going to take care of you . &quot;
i mean my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; as next to me , you &apos;re going to do the right thing , &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise to me is that you will never drink alcohol . &quot;
now , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up in the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s older a year older and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this sixpack beer with grabbed my sister and i went and went to the forest .
we just alberten around the same thing .
then he took a drink of a drink and i offered my sister to one , and she had one of them , and then offer me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no , no . it &apos;s all right . i don &apos;t want to . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do it . today , you &apos;re doing everything we do .
i had what , your sister had something . go , trink a beer .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . it only makes you . &quot;
my brother staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , you know what . &quot;
and he looked at me in the face , and he said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t still do it crazy for the conversation ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells all the grandchildren they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to say something .
i probably should not do that .
this is maybe the public übertragen .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i gestehe that i &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that , because i think it &apos;s tugendhaft . i say that it means identity .
if we create the right kinds of identity , we can tell people to tell us things that they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they could not .
of course , my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they are something special .
my grandfather was during the prison in prison .
my uncle died of alkoholinduzierten diseases .
and she believed that these are the issues that we need to take care of .
i tried to say something about our justizsystem .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in haftanstalten and prison .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
united states today have the highest inhaftierungsrate of the world .
seven million people are on bewährung , or bedingter strafaussetzung .
in my opinion , i think , has radically changed our world .
in socially weak and black parts of the population , despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male families between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , entlassen on bewährung or bedingter .
in urban communities across the country -- from los angeles , from los angeles , baltimore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of the black young men in prison , in prison , in bewährung , entlassen or bedingter .
but the system is not just shaped by the questions that have rassenzugehörigkeit , it also wird by poverty .
we have a justizsystem in this country that you treated much better when you &apos;re rich and guilty as poor and innocent .
wealth , not verschulden , influences the result .
yet , we seem to be quite satisfied with it .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s some hochinteressante developments .
my home home home is , dauerhaft , dauerhaft , dauerhaft , if you &apos;re convicted .
here and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male population permanently lost their wahlrecht .
we prognostizieren , in 10 years , that the percentage of the civic ehrenrechte of civic ehrenrechte as high as the verabschiedung of wahlrechtsgesetzes .
the silence is ohrenbetäubend .
i vertrete children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world , verurteilt children &apos;s dreizehnjährige children &apos;s death .
in this country , in this country &apos;s children , there are lebenslängliche haftstrafen ohne without this .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of work .
the only country in the world .
i vertrete people in todeszellen .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we believe , because we &apos;ve been taught that the real question is : has a human being deserves to die for a human begangenes crime ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other view is not : did anybody make death for death , but : do we deserve to kill it ?
i find that fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people that we were executed , one that we &apos;ve been executed for innocent , the entlastet and came out of death row .
an amazing fehlerquote . one of the nine .
i find that fascinating .
we would never be able to fly a plane with an airplane , for nine planes , die , abstürzt .
but somehow we can do it , in this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question , whether we &apos;re right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting , because i talk about my students , i &apos;m talking about slavery . i talk about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , time at the end of the rekonstruktion , until the beginning of the second world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
but for the kid in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynchmobs .
or vor bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
now , these older people come to me and say , &quot; mr. , stevenson , you &apos;re talking to me , you tell people that they should stop saying that we have to do it for the first time in the history of our nation , after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after the terrorism of terrorism , of course , of course , the rassentrennung passionate submission and apartheid of apartheid .
and yet there is a dynamic in our country in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what meaning our actions have in historical context .
we &apos;re constantly hitting each other .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to be able to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the rassentrennung can &apos;t overcome the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in our country .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to listen to you . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , you can never give them in germany . &quot;
it &apos;s been silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our history , it &apos;s impossible that we ever kill ourselves for the systematic killing of people .
it would be gewissenlos of us , aware and specific people . &quot;
i thought about it .
it would feel like it was to live in a world where german state had hinrichten people , especially when many jews .
it would be unerträglich .
it would be gewissenlos .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old südens , we richten humans , and yet , in this country , when it &apos;s black , when it is black , 22 times higher , when the angeklagte is black , and the victim knows -- in the same states , in their soil , the body gelynchter gelynchter people .
and yet there &apos;s these mental abkopplung .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with it , with these difficult topics , the positive and wonderful things are affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but eventually these realities are going to be überschattet , abuse , herabsetzung , ausgrenzung .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we eventually talk about hope that we need more engagement , more engagement , more commitment to a complex world .
to me , time for me to create time to think and to talk about the poor , the benachteiligten , who never will be at ted .
but think about a way that we have our own life in our own lives .
we all have to believe in the end of the things we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re so rational too appreciate it .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just coming from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this kopf-herz-verbindung that i think they &apos;re not only open to us to be open for all the bright and begeisternden things , but also for the dark and problematischen .
vaclav havel , the great tschechische politician , once said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe , we wanted to do everything , but what we needed most was hope , an intellectual orientation , the willingness to be sometimes in hoffnungslosen places and witness .
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe are getting engaged in this .
there &apos;s no distinction for technology and design that allows us to be human , and as long as long as long as long and ears , for poverty , ausgrenzung and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity takes a lot more of us than if we didn &apos;t take that .
she will touch them deeply .
as a young lawyer , i hatt the great privilege of hitting pink parks .
this time back back to montgomery , wo carr carr these older women , johnnie carr , die carr carr , who had unglaubliche carr carr -- and virginia durr , a white , whose husband , their husband , clifford durr , dr. king vertrat .
so those women met themselves and they were .
and then , a woman carr , and i said , &quot; bryan , &quot; bryan , ms. parks comes into the city . we want to talk . &quot;
do you want to dazukommen and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very happy . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just listened to .
it was always so inspiring , so inspiring .
and i was there was one day and i heard these women , and after a few hours , ms. parks to me turned to a woman who said , &quot; well , say , &quot; well , tell me what that is &quot; initiative for same .
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to build against injustice .
wr people want to help people who have innocent convicted .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the strafvollzugssystem .
we want to eliminate lebenslängliche haftstrafen without an individual needs for children .
we want to do something about death penalty companies .
we want to lower the number of death .
we want to eradicate masseninhaftierungen . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; mhmm . mhmm . &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
and then woman lehnte to me , in front of me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why they have to be very , very tapfer . &quot;
and so i think that the ted community should be tapferer .
we need to have ways to confront these challenges : these problems , this suffering .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity , from our humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i learned a few very simple things .
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for everybody on the planet .
when someone &apos;s lying is not just a liar .
if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t hear it , it &apos;s not just a dieb .
even who kills someone is not just a murderer .
and because this is , there is a fundamental human dignity that the law needs to respect .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think in many places that the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatic , it &apos;s so inspiring and so inspiring , we don &apos;t not be measured at the end of our technology , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not to our intellect and minds .
and ultimately , a society is not measured by how to treat their rich and powerful and powerful and privileged and privileged , but how to deal with the poor , the verurteilten , the inhaftierten .
because in this context , we start to understand the really amazing things that make us .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story at the end .
sometimes i urge too much .
i &apos;m tired , like we all .
sometimes these ideas are figuring out our thinking , in a very important way .
i vertrete these kids who have been convicted of very hard strafen verurteilt .
i go to the untersuchungsgefängnis , and visit a client who might be 13 or 14 years old and to be a adult .
then i wonder : how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn somebody into something that he doesn &apos;t ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a kid .
and one night i stayed up too long , and i thought , my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , it must be zauberkräfte .
right , bryan , the judge has zauberkräfte .
you should also wish .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think of it , i started working on a antrag .
i had a 14jährigen , poor black boys than clients .
and i started with this one . the headline said , &quot; hello , my poor , 14jährigen black clients like a privileged , white , white topmanager . &quot;
in my antrag , i explained that fehlverhalten of staatsanwaltschaft and the police and the police .
there was a crazy line of this , that in this country , there is nothing more rechtens that there is no more error .
the next morning i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i had dreamed of this crazy bill , or actually .
and i didn &apos;t only write it , but sent to the court .
a couple of months , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court , and i have a lot of them .
i went into the car and was really overwhelmed . overwhelmed .
so i drove to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard , so painful .
i finally went out of my car , and i went to the staircase .
when i went to court to the court , there was an elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and umarmte me .
then he flüsterte me in the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched a little deep in me , identity , the ability to contribute to a community , to a community of hope of hope .
well , i entered the gerichtssaal .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , asked these crazy verrückten ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
i had written these crazy things .
polizeibeamte came in and stellvertretende staatsanwälte and office workers .
in handumdrehen , the gerichtssaal was full of people who were angry , that we &apos;re talking about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my augenwinkel , i saw the janitors on and forth .
he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all the tohuwabohu .
he went up and down .
finally , this older schwarze man came with a sehr gesichtsausruck gesichtsausruck in the gerichtssaal , and she sat right behind me , almost to the verteidigungsbank .
ten minutes later the judge announced a pause .
during the break , a polizeibeamter came in , which was the janitors was in the gerichtssaal .
this deputy ran across the older black black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the gerichtssaal ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at me , and he looked at me , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to say that this young man , you don &apos;t lose the goal . don &apos;t give it . &quot;
i came to ted , because i think many of you understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far ausschwingt , but that it &apos;s the justice pendulum .
that we &apos;re not fully developing as humans , unless we take care of human rights and grundwerte .
that our survival has to survive with survival of each one .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity , with humanity , compassion and justice .
and in front of all , i want to show those of you , which is just just saying that , just say , you don &apos;t get the goal out of your eyes . don &apos;t give you .
you have this audience in this audience , in this community , there &apos;s a obvious wish to be able to help and do something .
what can we do ?
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a volksentscheid in this spring , where it is , actually a effort to do a effort , something about geldstrom umzuleiten that otherwise is flowing in the politics of punishment .
for example , california , in the next five years , you will be a billion dollars for the next five years , a billion dollars per billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all tötungsdelikte doesn &apos;t end with a verhaftung .
56 percent of all vergewaltigungsfälle are not coming in court .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
this referendum will suggest that the money to invest money in more sicherheitskräfte and security .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
during the last three decades , verbrechensrate in america has declined immense .
this is a lot of a relationship with increased inhaftierungszahlen .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
now , in fact , the number has not changed very much .
most of the masseninhaftierungen in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of gewaltverbrechen .
it was the fehlgeleitete kreuzzug against drugs .
so the dramatic numbers come with prisoners .
we have hinreißen from the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have &quot; drei-verstöße &quot; -gesetze that bring people out of bars for all of the bars , for a fahrraddiebstahl , for the theft of good , rather than that they force them to give back the sacrifice .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become the victims of a straftat , not less .
and i think our current doesn &apos;t help anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
bryan , you &apos;ve actually brought a string into a string .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
thank you for being at ted . thank you .
bin laden is bringing to bin gefahrenrisiko with himself .
famine in somalia : famine in somalia . three : o.c. spray .
four : enormous kartelle . five : dangerous kreuzfahrtschiffe .
six people : social decline . 7 : 65 dead .
8 : tsunamiwarnung . sprecher 9 : cyber-attacken
different speakers : drogenkrieg . tornado .
recession . stillstand . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . katastrophe .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips that i collected over the last six months -- it would have been to be the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that media prefer to show us negative subjects because our minds get to attention exactly these topics .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
every single second , our senses will every day begin to process our senses as our brain .
and because we have nothing more important than our survival , the first stop stop for all the information is part of our temporallappens , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our frühwarnsystem , our gefahrendetektor .
it sortiert and durchkämmt all the information on the search for any andeutung of danger in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old saying , when it blutet , the demand is really true .
now , with all of our digital devices that seven days week , 24 days , 24 hours a day , all of this negative news is not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that it &apos;s always worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe it &apos;s the reality .
and perhaps the enormous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century is that we &apos;ve been able to create a world of forces in the next three decades , to create a world of abundance .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we have no big problems -- climate crisis , artensterben , water and energieprobleme -- that we have .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at making problems in a very long way , but ultimately , to overcome them .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has doubled more than doubled that angepasste durchschnittseinkommen of the world &apos;s population has tripled .
child mortality has a tenth .
it comes out of the ernährungs- , elektrizitäts- transport- and communication costs have been reduced .
steve pinker has shown us that we currently live in a very peaceful era of life .
and charles kenny is a 25 percent of 25 percent over the last 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
in fact , we have neu poverty .
remember , a lot of the americans who live under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , tv , klimaanlagen , klimaanlagen and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the imperatoren of the earth , would never have been able to dream like that .
the basis of a lot of these forms of technologies , and they grow .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that will become the information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law &apos;s law , and it &apos;s doubling every 12 to 24 months .
so the mobile phone in your pocket is about a million times less , and it &apos;s a million faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how smooth it is -- in good times , war or peace , recession , depression and hochkonjunktur .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
they &apos;re slowed down for neither of our big problems .
also , despite her logarithmic verlaufs on the left , it &apos;s up .
so growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to everyone .
&quot; cloud-computing , &quot; which is called &quot; cloud-computing , &quot; infinite-computing , &quot; etwas &quot; infinite-computing &quot; , which will enable to democratize to democratize production on our planet , synthetic , synthetic , synthetic biology , fuel , immunization and food , digital medicine and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibms supercomputer watson at the risk ?
that was great .
i &apos;ve been looking for the newspapers , after the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson bezwingt menschlichen human enemies . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that these artificial intelligence would run on every owner of a mobiltelefones .
four years ago , we launched ray kurzweil , and i was a new university called singularity university .
we bring our students to all these technologies , focusing on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students to create business , business , products and services within a decade that can affect billions of people in positive .
think about that a group of students today can affect the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this would be ridiculous .
today , we can have known for dozens of companies that did exactly this .
if i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of opportunity .
it &apos;s about creating a crowded goods of abundance .
so scarcity is kontextbezogen , and technology is a resource befreiende force force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of napoleon iii. in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy left .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
napoleons soldiers got silber-besteck , napoleon himself .
but the king of siam got aluminium-besteck .
aluminum was at that time the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and platin .
this is why the dome &apos;s dome made out of aluminum .
even though aluminum 8,3 takes up percent of the erdmasse , it &apos;s not a pure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silikate .
but then the technology of the elektrolyse developed so cheap that we use it with our wegwerf-mentalität .
then let &apos;s project this analogy to the future .
we think today about energieknappheit .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet of 5.000-mal more energy than we &apos;re using a year .
16 terawatt energy all prasseln in the surface of the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time to reduce solar power in india to 50 percent of the diesel-stroms , compared to 17 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar is in the last year by 50 percent .
last month , this has been published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the united states in the sunny areas of the united states in the sunny areas of the united states is going to six cents a kwh , compared to 15 cents at national average .
and if we have a energieüberschuss , we &apos;ll also have water in abundance .
let &apos;s talk about wasser-kriege .
do you remember , when carl sagan sagan sagan , when it was on saturn , then it turned back to earth , back to the earth ?
he took a famous photo . what was it meant ?
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a wasserplaneten life .
we live on a planet that is covered in 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s 97,5 percent salzwasser , two percent of them are vereist , and we &apos;re fighting by 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new nanotechnologien on the way , nano-materialien .
and from a conversation today with dean kaman , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share with them -- he gave me the permission -- his technolgie , the &quot; slingshot , &quot; and many of you may have heard about it . it &apos;s the size of a kühlschranks .
it can create a thousand gallons of clean drinking water a day from various sources of clean drinking water , if saltwater , ob water , latrine -- and all of that for less than two cents a liter .
the head of coca-cola has just been eingewilligt to start a large test-projekt with a hundred units in the developing world .
and when it &apos;s good , i &apos;m very confident , very confident , it will apply coca-cola to the world globally in 206 countries around the planet .
this is the innovation that we have today .
and we &apos;ve seen this on mobile phones too .
you know , god , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent abdeckungsrate of mobile phones in the developing world to the end of 2013 .
just think of a massai-krieger with a cell phone in the middle of kenya , a better way than president reagan has been 25 years ago .
and if you look for your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has the information and communications abundance of how nobody could possibly have predicted .
and it &apos;s even better , the things you and i spent a thousand dollars spent on -- gps , hd-video and photo , libraries of books and music , technology to medical imaging -- literally entmaterialisiert and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best part of that is perhaps what we expected in health .
in the last month i had to announce the pleasure called &quot; $ 10 million qualcomm tricorder tricorder tricorder . &quot;
we &apos;re demanding teams around the world to connect all these technologies into a cell phone that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s artificial equipped with ai , you can test or test reinhusten .
and to win , the device needs a better diagnosis than a team of hochqualifizierter physicians .
imagine this device . in the developing world where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the krankheitslast and 1.3 percent of the health staff of healthcare .
if this device sequenced a rna- or a dna-virus , it &apos;s not known , it calls out , and prevents a pandemic in front of its outbreak .
but now to the greatest force that will lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are in population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the 7-milliarden-marke .
and by the way , the largest absicherung against explosion against population is a better education and a better upbringing in the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people online .
until 2020 , we &apos;re going from two to five billion internetnutzer .
three billion new minds that we &apos;ve never heard before , will join global communication .
what do these people need ? ?
what are they going to consume ? what are they going to do ?
and instead of ecological gridlock , i see one of the greatest economic anschübe of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars to flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to become a healthier use of the tricoders , and they &apos;re getting better trained through the khan-akademie , and by using 3d printers and infinite computing , as much more productive than ever .
so what can three billion , healthy , educated , productive members of the menschengemeinde us ?
how about it would be a set of new , never before gehörter voices .
how would it be , the oppressed , wherever you are to give up a voice to pay attention and make change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people will bring ?
how about beiträgen that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i &apos;ve learned is that i &apos;ve learned that small teams that are motivated by passion and focus are motivated to create extraordinary things , things that the big business and governments could only do in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might know .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will evolve .
according to his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medizinforschung .
so far this was a problem for supercomputers .
and this game was played by university professors .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that the human pattern recognition is more much better the proteins than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who was the best part of the world , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who worked in the day as an assistant at a reha-klinik , and at night the best protein-ordnerin in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what i believe in our future , in our future , is that we today have more power to provide the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to an exponential technology .
we have the passion of a diy-innovatoren .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropen .
and we have three billion heads that we can work online to address the new challenges , and to do what is necessary .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something against the medical culture of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor and i am .
and maybe i &apos;ve been enough in business enough for me to give you a piece of my own falschen to give you a stück piece of my own prestiges to this .
but before i actually come from my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the saisonende near and moving to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; moneyball , &quot; soon &quot; bald &quot; is about statistics , is about statistics and to use these to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m related to one that i hope i &apos;m hoping that most of you have heard of .
it &apos;s the durchschnittsleistung of the schlägers .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a bat &apos;s beating .
that means the player is safe beats for three beats .
it &apos;s called the ball to außenfeld , it &apos;s coming up , he &apos;s going to come up , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball for the first base , hasn &apos;t done it in time , and the läufer was safe .
three out 10 from 10 . 10 . 10 . 10 .
you know how to call a 300ter 300ter in major baseball ?
good , really good , maybe a all-star .
you know how to call a 400ter ?
that &apos;s someone who hits the rest of 10 .
legendär -- like ted williams legendär -- the last major league of baseball player during a regulären season over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world in medicine , where i feel more comfortable , or maybe a little less comfortable , maybe a little less comfortable with you .
suppose you &apos;ve got a blinddarmentzündung , and you überwiesen to a operateur , which is durchschnittsleistung , in terms of blinddarmentzündungen .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
so if you &apos;re living in a particular remote area , and you have a beloved man with verstopften herzkranzgefäßen and her hausarzt überweist of this to a kardiologen , which is durchschnittsleistung at 200 .
but , but you know what ?
she &apos;s a lot better this year . it &apos;s on the aufsteigenden .
and it &apos;s schlägt .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you believe in the durchschnittsleistung or a nurse or a nurse or a nurse or a nurse , you should be a rettungsassistenten ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in all medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor or a doctor or a doctor should be .
but what we do is we have to be eingeschlossen every one of them , including me , in the world to be perfect with the claim .
never do a mistake , but nobody makes the details of the details of how to do this .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was a zwanghaft obsessiver student .
in high school , a school school was told that brian mitschüler would learn that brian goldmann .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little dachstube in the sisters of the toronto general hospital , unweit of here .
i learned everything .
in my anatomievorlesung , i learned the origins and the tail of every artery , every branch of a artery , which welchen from the aorta , obskure and ordinary differentialdiagnosen .
i even knew the differentialdiagnose to classify renale tubuläre azidose .
and i &apos;d be able to collect more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i closed with cum laude .
and i left medical school with the impression that if i knew everything and knew everything , or at least as much as possible , as close to vollständigkeit as possible that i was immune to make mistakes .
and it worked for a time until i met a woman printer .
i residierte in a lehrkrankenhaus here in toronto in toronto as a woman , as a woman to me in the notfallabteilung of the hospital .
at that point , i was feeding the kardiologischen layer in the kardiologischen service .
and it was my assignment when the notfallpersonal kardiologischen advice was a piece of advice .
and put feedback on my oberarzt .
i studied a woman printer , and she was in atemnot .
and when i share her , she made keuchende sounds .
and when i abhörte your chest with the stethoskope , i could hear a knackendes sound on both sides , which told me that she was suffering under kongestiver heart failure .
this is actually failing a state in which the heart fails , instead of pumps all the blood , you have a part of your blood in the lung , and it began gradually , so the kurzatmigkeit came out .
and that was not hard to be stellenden .
i hired her and made my treatment .
i gave her aspirin . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call diuretics , water pills , so that they ausschied the liquid .
and over a period of a year and a half and two hours , she started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i actually made two mistakes .
i sent them home without my oberarzt .
i didn &apos;t take it on the side , and i did what i should have been to have been a call of what i &apos;d been calling to him , so that he had a chance to have a picture .
and he knew it , he would have been able to have additional information to her beizusteuern .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the hilfsbedürftige doctor .
maybe i wanted to be able to take the responsibility that i was so successful , and so i would be able to worry about my patients without touch with him .
my second mistake was worse .
and so that &apos;s what i sent her home , i missachtete a quiet voice , i tried to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . do it not . &quot;
in fact , it really lacked to me that i asked the nurse who was the nurse , &quot; do you believe it &apos;s okay if you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse was thinking about it , and she said , &quot; oh , i think it &apos;s going to be good . &quot;
i remember that it was yesterday .
so i put the entlassungspapiere and an ambulance and an ambulance and rettungsassistenten and rettungsassistenten and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this nagende feeling in my stomach .
but i worked on .
and i grabbed my stuff at the end of the day , leaving the hospital , and went to drive home with the car , and i did something else that i didn &apos;t .
i went home by the notfallabteilung .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen after a woman who had seen after woman , but another three words , and these three words , and i fear that i know .
well , other doctors fear the same , but the notfallmedizin is particularly special , because we just see the patients so flüchtig .
the three words say , remember ?
&quot; remember the patients you thought ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular tonlage .
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
about an hour after her home , after i sent her home , she collapsed , and the family collapsed 911 . the rettungsassistenten took them back to a blood pressure with a blood pressure , which is a dangerous blood pressure .
they barely breathe and was blue angelaufen .
the notfallpersonal moved all the strands .
they gave her blutdruckerhöher .
they closed them on the beatmungsmaschine .
i was shocked , and i was schockiert .
and i go through this rollercoaster , because it was after the stabilisation of the stabilisation , and i hoped that she would recover .
and after two , three days , i realized she was never going to awakening again .
she had not had a behandelbaren gehirnschaden .
their family gathered together .
and over the course of eight or nine days , they made the geschehenen .
on the neuten day , she liesen her -- a printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say , you have never forget the names of the names .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
and i told you the next weeks , and i was worried about food , for the first weeks , that food exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you all know the healthy scham prize , if you &apos;ve got a secret &apos;s secret , if you &apos;ve got a secret to the best friend , and the best friend and the best friend , and my horrible friend , when you end up at the end , it leads to the bad conscience , and you get a fehler that you never do it again .
if you don &apos;t ever make it , and never make the mistakes again .
that &apos;s the kind of lehrreicher shame .
what i &apos;m talking about is the food that makes one in the innersten .
it &apos;s the one that tells you not what you &apos;re doing is bad , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my oberarztes , he was very happy .
he spoke with the family , and i &apos;m sure he was sure that he was wogen and sure that i would not be sued .
but i asked these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the question ? why did i do it home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
slowly , it put it .
i started feeling better .
and then on a bewölkten day , there was a hole coming into the clouds and the sun and i might feel better to feel better .
and i was like , if i had doubled my efforts to perfection and never again make a mistake that the voice could verstummen .
and she did .
and i worked on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the notfallstation hospital in a kommunalen hospital north of toronto , and i begutachtete a 25 year-old man with gereiztem rachen .
it was a lot in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked in the rachen , and it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and when he went out the door , he showed his rachen .
two days later , i came up to my next notfalldienst , and my chefärztin asked to a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember telling the patients with the gereizten rachen ? &quot;
it turned out to be a streptokokken-infektion .
he had an potentially lebensgefährliche disease called epiglottitis .
you can google this , but it &apos;s not an infection to the top of the rachens , but the top of the atemwege .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
he got intravenöse antibotica and recovered , a few days later .
and i went back through the same tortur of shame and self-doubt , felt me befreit , and went back to work until it and again and again .
in a notfallschicht , i &apos;ve missed two times two times two times .
there &apos;s a lot of things , especially when you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that only 14 patients had 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was probably no mängel in their treatment .
and i thought he had nierensteine .
i x-ray my kidneys . when it was without befund , my colleague , my colleague at the wiedervorstellung of the patient , was stuck on the bottom right , and called the operateure .
the other had strong diarrhea .
i ordnete fluide around him and asked my colleagues as well .
and he did , and he did a verhärtung in the lower the lower sector , called the operateure .
in both cases , operierte , and it was good .
both of these cases nagten me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened in the first five years , what many of my colleagues are saying , but totaler .
some of my favorites happened in the last five years .
alone , beschämt and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t go to my mistakes with my mistakes and talk about you , if i can speak , if i agree with the quiet voice , tell me , what really happened to me , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes , so they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i was in a room -- like now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time of someone who has heard about fehlschlag talking about fehlschlag ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and you might hear about any other doctor , but you don &apos;t want to talk about your own mistakes .
if i was in a room with colleagues , and to start telling them what i was telling you , i would probably not end up to the end of the second story , before you get them uncomfortable , someone would change a joke , you would change the topic and forget the rest of the rest .
and in fact , if i knew about my colleagues would have taken someone wrong in my hospital the wrong leg , then you believe me , i could have seen problems in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system in which we live .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- the ones that make mistakes and the ones that don &apos;t do . those who einschränkt einschränkt , without the limitation , with bad results with bad results and with good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response like antibodies to attack a human .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we have the people who make mistakes in the medizin that we have a sure system .
but there are two problems in this .
in my about 20 years of medical science and journalism , i have a personal medical study in a personal medical study , so everything i was making for one of my first article , for the toronto star star to my show , &quot; white coat , black art , &quot; writing .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely unumgänglich .
we &apos;re working in a system where every day , in which one of 10 medikationen is either a false or wrong , in which one of the krankenhausinfektionen is always going to be around and more and more and more and more and more and more and more , and more and more and more and more and planets or dead .
in this state , there are about 24,000 canadians in umgänglichen mistakes .
in the united states , the institute has put the institute in 100,000 medicine .
both are strong untertreibungen , because we should not look at the problem as much as we should .
and is the crux .
in a krankenhaussystem where the medical wisdom , every two or three years doubled , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
schlafmangel is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake so we can take a perfect krankheitsverlauf for patients with chest pain .
and then i take the same patient with brustschmerz , making it verschwitzt , and give it a slightly alkoholisierten breath , and suddenly the story is durchsetzt durchsetzt with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same trajectory .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are no cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of these are mistakes .
so if you take the system as i &apos;ve been taught , as i got it taught , and all fehlerbehafteten gesundheitsexperten , at the end of it , no longer .
and you know the leier about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
so i would say , &quot; white coat , &quot; i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; this is my worst mistake , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about her ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show the microphone with the microphone .
and then they expand their lens , they came across front of the head , and they &apos;re looking down and swallow , and they start to tell their stories .
they want to tell stories . they want to share their stories .
you want to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i &apos;m fabrizierte . &quot;
what you need is an environment that you can put in the position .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the arzt is a human doctor knows a human being white , knows how a doctor , is not proud to make mistakes , but it &apos;s all the way to learn from them , so it can be passed on .
she shares your experience with others .
it supports the rest of your mistakes .
and it shows others who are mistakes , not about bloßzustellen , but in loving ways that all of them benefit from .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture , which recognizes that people fill the system with life , and if that is , people are also making mistakes from time .
that the system allows us to create , which is inevitable , which is that the way that we can make it easier to determine the health care system that anyone who can be able to do the potential of potential things that can be rewarded , and even rewarded , and it &apos;s actually rewarded , and that specifically for people like me to make mistakes and should be rewarded for the begradigung of these rewards .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the arzt arzt .
i &apos;m a person . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m bedaure das. , but i &apos;m trying to learn best to learn from it to pass it to others .
i don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about veränderbare normwerte .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you about three stories to use time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know he was 1835 here .
you might think he jagte finken , but that &apos;s not true .
he actually collected fish .
he described one of these as a very common .
it was a zackenbarsch .
until the &apos; 80s in the &apos; 80s , he was gefischt .
now it says , on the red list .
we &apos;ve heard this story a lot of times in the galapagos or in other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they are originally .
the broschüren describe it as pristine .
what &apos;s happened here ? ?
the second story is a different concept , the veränderbare taillenweite .
because i experienced it when i spoke to a lagoon in 1971 .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate .
and i got a bad sonnenbrand , and i was convinced that i didn &apos;t get out of there .
it was my first sonnenbrand .
as you can see , the lagoon in palmen and some mangroves .
there were 20 inches of about 20 centimeters , schwarzkinnmaulbrüter , schwarzkinnmaulbrüter , eine .
the fischgründe of these buntbarsche were very ertragreich , and the fishermen lived very well in ghana and made in ghana on a good good .
when i returned there 27 years later , the fish shrunk had shrunk on half his size .
reaching five inches five centimeters .
they were genetically modified .
there were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had to be lucky to be there .
so it has nothing changed , and yet everything has changed .
my third story , my favorite story of my favorite story in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- more at the beginning of the &apos; 60s -- förderte europe , many entwicklungsprojekte europe .
fischförderung meant in countries that were already 100 fish , the industrial fishing fishery , which was pretty ugly , which was quite ugly ship .
i was driving on it , and we was putting out on the entire southern sea of sea , and especially in the javasee .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know it was the bottom of the ocean .
90 percent of our lives were sponges , other animals that are connected to the bottom .
the largest part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble , were korallenriff-fische .
basically , the bottom of the sea was auf , and then it became zurückgeworfen .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
within a year , you start a survey , and then you start with the commercial fishing .
and the reason is changing -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals or soft coral crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eating them , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a living .
she wasn &apos;t ertrunken yet .
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat them .
in fact , this mountain of trümmern had to fill each other from fishermen every time , if they go to areas where they &apos;re never gefischt .
it &apos;s not going to be documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our new level , and we don &apos;t want to remind us what was there .
so if you get it , here .
on the y-axis are a few good things : biodiversity , number of orca , the green of their country , the wasservorrat .
at the time , it changes . it changes , because for people , they are quite natural .
each generation looks at the images that they &apos;re in the beginning of their conscious life , as standard and it &apos;s going to escape all of it .
the difference is perceived as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses true .
there can be a sequence of changes .
and in the end , you just want to get the erbärmlichen remains .
that &apos;s largely , largely our goal .
we want to get things that are gone , or things that are not like they were .
now you could think that the problem of people in the räuberischen , when they were living in räuberischen societies , were killing animals , then they were killing them , and they were aware of what they had done .
because obviously an animal that gave it very often , once even once , before it ausstirbt .
so you don &apos;t often lose occurring animals .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as big loss .
we &apos;re focusing on the big animals at the ocean , and the ocean is the big fish .
they become less rare because we start .
with the time there &apos;s a little fish left , we think that &apos;s the normwert .
the question is why people accept it .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was something else .
of course , many people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
they will confirm it , because the evidence , because the evidence of the earlier form in the earlier form , they are not as much as they would like to make the evidence .
so , for example , there &apos;s an anecdote that the report of a kapitäns project that observed in this area is not used to be used by fischereiwissenschaftlern , or not gewertet , because it doesn &apos;t be scientific .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in educated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this is a huge big role that can be a marine reserve .
because in the marine area , we basically put the past the past .
we think the past again that people can &apos;t understand , because the normwerte have changed and very low .
so the people who are able to see a marine reserve and benefit from the insight that allows you to have to zurücksetzen your normwerte .
what about the people who can &apos;t do that , because they have no access to the people in the midwest ?
here i think art and film might fill the gap that the gap , and simulation .
this is chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was grauwale -- 500 years ago .
and the farbtöne and -schattierungen may remind you , &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why the people were so touched -- apart from the pocahontas-geschichte , why were it so touched by the bilderwelt ?
because it &apos;s something that went missing in a way .
so my first guy , the only thing i &apos;m going to give you , works at the cameron avatar , so he turns out &quot; avatar &quot; underwater .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist ostdeutschland , you had to register , if you owned a typewriter , in the government .
they also had to register a sheet of beispieltext from this typewriter .
the reason for this : the government could trace where a text came from .
found an article with falschem gedankengut , and they could detect the creator of these thoughts .
and we couldn &apos;t understand in the west , how anybody could do something like this , and how much of freedom of speech would be .
in our own countries , we would never do this .
but if you buy a new farblaserdrucker from the leading laserdruckerfabrikanten , and you print a new page , then this page has bright yellow flecke on every page , in a pattern that clearly leaves it on them and ihren it .
that &apos;s what happens to us today .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be aufzuregen .
and this was an example of our own way our own governments to us using technology against us .
and this is one of the three hauptquellen of these today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can split attacks in categories .
we have three hauptgruppen .
there &apos;s online-kriminelle .
for instance , this is mr. dimitry golubow from kiew in ukraine .
and the motives of online-kriminellen are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they use online-angriffe to make a lot of money , a ton of money .
there are several known cases of online-millionären , multimillionären that their money had made by attacks .
this is wladimir tsastsin in estonia .
this is alfred gonzalez .
stephen watts .
björn sundin .
this is matthew anderson , tariq al-daour and so on .
these people have come together online , and they have acquired them online , for example , for example , using money from our bankkonten to claws , as we &apos;re doing our online-banking , or keylogger , who have collected our kredikarteninformationen with the input over the keyboard while we shop online .
the u.s. intelligence account two months ago , two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam &apos;s jain , and on this account , was 14,9 million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain itself is not an open foot , der is unknown .
and i claim that it &apos;s more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be a victim than a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be even worse .
in the future , most crimes online .
the second largest angreifergruppe we can observe today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- the protests , or through their audience .
gruppen groups like anonymous are moved over the last 12 months , and they have become one of the hauptspieler in the field of online-angriffe .
so these are the three hauptangriffsgruppen : criminals who do it for money , hacktivisten like anonymous , who do their resistance , but the last group is nations , governments who conduct attacks .
there &apos;s a cases of diginotar .
it turns out what happens when governments will attack their own citizens .
diginotar is a vollmachtszertifikat from the netherlands -- or it was that .
in the last fall , it had to be hacked , because diginotar was hacked .
somebody has been hacked and hacked the system .
and last week in a meeting with dutch regierungsvertretern , i asked one of the senior scientists that he was going to make it for possible because of the diginotar-hacks people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying in a row of hacks ?
diginotar is a zertifizierungsstelle .
they sell zertifikate .
what do you do with zertifikaten ?
well , certificate , you need to do a website with https of service , for example .
now , in particular , these services , in particular , sind states , like the iran , are using gmail states like gmail , because they know that they can trust more than local trust , and that they can &apos;t have the local government in their conversation .
but if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign ?
zertifizierungsbehörde hacken and gefälschte zertifikate .
and that &apos;s what happens by diginotar .
how about the arab spring and things that happened to happen in egypt , for example , in egypt ?
now , in egypt , the aufständischen plünderten in april in april , 2011 , the egyptian headquarters . and then they found a lot of records .
in this files , a folder was a folder called &quot; finfisher . &quot;
and in this folder , a local local company in a local local company , in the egyptian , in the egyptian government , a few programs , in very large framework , in very large framework , the egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for 280.000 euro to the egyptian government .
the firmenhauptquartier is right here .
so western governments provide governments with hilfsmitteln , so that they can use their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago , a few weeks ago , the so-called staatstrojaner , was used to be used by german regierungsvertretern to bespitzeln her own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be verdächtigt in a kriminalfall verdächtigt , your phone will be angezapft .
but today we are far beyond that .
they tap on their connection .
they use resources like the staatstrojaner to bespielen their computers with a trojaner that allows them to monitor their entire communication , their online-diskussionen abzuhören to collect their passwörter .
so if we continue to think about these things , the obvious answer would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter to me because i &apos;m a braver citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument makes no sense .
privacy must be given .
privacy is not a debate .
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a choice between liberty and control .
and as we have today , in 2011 , in 2011 , our governments , we &apos;re right now , we &apos;re right , we &apos;ll be abgeben for forever .
and we trust , we trust a trust every future , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to look at the next 50 years .
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of betonblocksteinen .
the first betonblocksteine was made 1868 and entstammten a simple idea of a simple idea : modules made out of cement with minimal dimensions that fit .
betonbausteine were very fast the meistgenutzte baueinheit in the world .
they gave us to build things that were bigger than we , buildings , the bridges , a stone after the other .
basically , the betonbaustein was in the building block of our time building .
for almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out .
it was called &quot; automatisch stone . &quot;
and within a few years , lego moved into every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on the planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it all possible for everyone .
lego basically has the betonbaustein , the building block in the world , and made it a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , at the bell , he announced the next revolution , the next building block , the next building block .
the transistor was a little plastikeinheit that would bring us from a world of static static , aufeinandergestapelten building blocks into a world that would be interactive .
like the betonblock , the transistor allows us to build much more complex , more complex cycles of more complex , a stone after the other .
but there &apos;s a hauptunterschied : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept that the building is reserved reserved for experts , and so i decided to change it .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i began to explore this idea how to make the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing littlebits .
let me show you how they work .
littlebits are electronic modules that have specific function .
they &apos;re vorgefertigt , light , sound , motor and sensor .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets together .
so you can &apos;t get them wrong .
the stones are farbcodiert .
green is a copy , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is wires .
so all you need to do is you have a blue blue and you connect to each other , and you can build a very quickly building very quickly .
they put a blue one on one green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between , and so you created a little dimmer .
take the switch out , take the switch out here , put the switch out here , put you into this , and you did a little blinker .
add this buzzer effect for an extra effect , and you &apos;ve made a lärmmaschine .
i &apos;ll stop that .
beyond the simple play , it &apos;s actually quite powerful .
instead of code , you have to code , you have to code , you have to program , you need to be able to code , intuitive gestures , intuitive gestures .
so , in order to slow or slow , they just turn on this button , and it makes the momentum of momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind littlebits is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction in the world in a gebrauchsfertigen stone .
lights , sound , solarelemente , motors -- should be available .
we &apos;ve seen kids out of children , and they can see it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful is , as you start to understand the electronics that you can understand in the everyday life , and you don &apos;t learn in school .
like for example , for example , a nachtlicht works , or why the doors of aufzugs would respond to the aufzugs of an ipod .
we also have gebracht gebracht .
so , for example , we had any designer with no experience in electronic things that began to play with littlebits as material .
here we see , with filz , paper and water water , like geordie ...
a couple of weeks ago , we have brought to risd , and we gave them a few designers that had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a bewegungsgesteuerte konfetti-kanone .
but wait , this is really my lieblings-projekt .
it &apos;s a hummer of play-doh , the fear of darkness .
for those nicht-ingenieure , littlebits became another material , and electronics was just another material .
and we want to make this material available for all available .
so , littlebits is open source .
you can go to the website , all designvorlagen and download them .
we want to encourage the world of the creators , the inventor , the inventors , because this world we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
so , pull out , pull them out .
thank you .
