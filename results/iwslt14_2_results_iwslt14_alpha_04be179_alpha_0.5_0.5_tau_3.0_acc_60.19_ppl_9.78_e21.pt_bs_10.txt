you know , one of the great vernügen in travel and one of the pleasures of the ethnographischen research is to live with people who still remember the old days , the past is still in the wind , they touch on the rain geglätteten stones , they taste in the bitter sheets of plants .
and the importance of the edges of the inuit of the inuit , it means that , in the way , the importance of the world &apos;s atem means , or that in the himalayas , the buddhist is still with the breath of the u.k. , which is what we live , but only as a model of reality , but only as a model of reality is , as a consequence of a group of the reality that we think of , though , even successful , though , despite many generations .
and of course we all share the same anpassungsnotwendigkeiten .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing children to the world .
we go through initiationsrituale .
we need to deal with the unaufhaltsamen separation of death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dancing and making art .
but interesting is the unique tonfall of liedes , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s a role in the forests in the forests , or the voodoo-akolythen in the middle of the sahara , or the voodoo-akolythen in the middle of the sahara . this is the colleague that i traveled to desert a month before a month ago , or even a yak-hirte on the hängen , everest , the gottmutter of the world .
all these people teach us that there are other types of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways , other ways to the earth .
and that &apos;s an idea that , if you think about it , you can fulfill one with hope .
together , the myriad cultures in the world make a net from spirituellem and kulturellem life , which is the earth , and for the sake of the earth as important as the biological lebensnetz , which you know as biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural lebensnetz as a ethnosphäre , and ethnosphäre can imagine , as a ethnosphäre of all of thoughts and dreams dreams , myths , inspiration , that have been inspirationen from human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
the ethnosphäre is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we &apos;re capable of as an amazing species .
and the same way the biosphere has been abgetragen , this happened with the ethnosphäre -- just greater speed .
a biologist would say to say that 50 percent or more of all species are just before than extinction , because it &apos;s not true , and yet , this -- the apokalyptischste szenarium in the field of biological diversity -- is almost almost what we &apos;re known as optimistischstes in the field of cultural diversity .
and the key implication of this is extinction .
when every one of them was born in this room , 6,000 6,000 languages on earth .
now , a language is not just the full of vokabulars or a series of grammatikregeln .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means to find the soul of a certain culture access to the physical world .
every language is like a altbestehender forest of the mind , a turning point , a gedanke , an ecosystem .
and of those 6,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , the half of the ears in monterey .
they &apos;re not taught anymore anymore . that means that if nothing is done , they &apos;re already dead .
what could be a lonely from the silence to be one of the last your people who talk to your language to have no way to have any way to share the wisdom of the ancestors , or to expect hope ?
and yet , this horrible fate actually happens to someone somewhere on the earth , about two weeks , because every two weeks , one of the elderly dies , and take the last silben of an old language in the grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; it &apos;s not better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t it be a better place , if we were all going to speak a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s do this language . let &apos;s be kantonesisch .
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
and then suddenly you would see how it would be if you could not speak your own language .
and so i want to take you in a way of a trip to a trip through the ethnosphäre , a short journey through the ethnosphäre to try and make you understand what &apos;s actually been lost .
now there are some among us that , in a way that i think , when i say , &quot; different ways of being , &quot; really different ways of mine .
so , for example , for example , for example , this child , for example , in the amazon of the amazon , the people of the anakonda , believe that they mythologisch the middle of the east from the east from holy snakes .
this is a people who are not cognitively between the color and green because the forest is different from the forest that people depend on , gleichgestellt .
they have a strange language and a heiratsvorschrift that &apos;s called the linguistic exogamie : you have to marry someone who talks a different language .
all this is rooted in the mythologischen past past , and it &apos;s curious about those big houses in which because of the mischehen six or seven languages , though , you &apos;re never talking to someone who learns a language .
you just listen to you and start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the waorani in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people who first was friedlich friedlich .
in 1957 , in 1957 , there were going to be five missionare and made a schwerwiegenden mistake .
they warfen glänzende glänzende from the air , which we would rate as a friendly act , and they forgot that these people had never seen something from the rainforest in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see the face or the character , they didn &apos;t find anything , that this was the business business of devil , and killed the five missionare with the spear .
but the waorani is not just killing any ants with the spear .
they durchbohrten each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened by durchbohrungen .
we followed at the geneaologie eight generations and found two cases of a natural death , and when we were doing the people with nachdruck , they gave them , they gave that one of the people who were so old , he died because of his age , and we killed him with the spear .
but at the same time , they had a clear one of the forests that was amazing .
their jäger could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps , and determine what animal species of this owned .
i got a really amazing job when i was interested in harvard , when i was interested in the early 80iger , when i was interested in to go to haiti and the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength of duvalier and tonton macoutes , and the poison that was used to make zombies to make sure .
to give a sense of that , of course , i had to give sense about a little bit about this remarkable faith , and voodoo is not a cult of the black magic .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex kind of metaphysische worldview worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask you to ask the large world , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , buddhism , judaismus or whatever .
a continent is getting left , because the guess is that there is no religious faith in sub-saharan africa , of course there was a little bit of a very profound religious thought , which is the tragic diaspora of the tragic diaspora .
but what makes voodoo interesting is this living relationship between living and the dead .
the people join the minds .
the minds can be heraufbeschwört from under the big water , answers to the rhythm of dance , to replace the soul of the living temporary , so that the akolyth for a brief moment is going to be the god .
deshab like to say , &quot; you &apos;re going to the church and speak about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you take it from the mind . how can you do damage ?
so you see this amazing demonstrations : voodoo-akolythen in a trancezustand , the glühende of coal without combustion anfassend , an amazing graph of the mind of the mind to influence the body that this is aushält when he is versetzt into a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all the people i met were the kogi of the sierra nevada de marta in nordkolumbien , the most special extraordinary .
offspring in the old tyrannischen civilization , which is the heart of colombia covered by colombia and in a consequence of the eroberung , that the people had a massive massiv massive , which is about the karibischen küstenebene .
in a blutbefleckten continent , these people were the only ones who were never conquered by the spaniern .
to the day , the day , they &apos;re governed by a ritual priesterschaft , which is the education , though , is very extraordinary .
the young akolythen are separated by the age of three and four years old , in steinhütten on the front of the glaciers for 18 years , and two periods of the glaciers for 18 years , for 18 years , it &apos;s taken for the nine months of pregnancy , who spent the nine months of pregnancy who spent in their own mother , now spend metamorphorisch in the lap of the big mother .
and during that time , they &apos;re being introduced to the values of their society , values that maintain the claim that their prayers and their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the environmental -- maintain balance .
and then , for the first time , you &apos;re going to see one day out of the first light , and at the age of the first light , at the age of the first light , you &apos;re going to see it , and you see the first time in your life , so suddenly everything you know , and the priest , and the priests comes back and says , &quot; see , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really how i told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they &apos;ll call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
and whenever we think about eingeborene and landscape , we &apos;re either herauf , and the old piece of the fancy wild wilden , which is a rassistischer thought , or by thoreau , and say these people are more connected to nature than we are .
so , eingeborene are not sentimental , they &apos;re going to get out of the nostalgie .
but it &apos;s not a lot of space in the malariaverseuchten of tibet or the cold winds of tibet , but they still have shaped a mystery of the earth that &apos;s not based on the idea of being close , but on a weit intuition intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist because it &apos;s going to be human consciousness .
well , what does that mean ?
it means that the mountain is a little kid , that &apos;s a small child , and it &apos;s going to be a very different person , and a different kind of the resource , as a little kid from montana , which is a small child in montana , that a mountain is a bunch of stones that can become the abgetragen .
if he &apos;s a aufenthaltsort of a mind or a bunch of erz , it &apos;s irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of britisch colombia and believed that these forests are there to become gerodet .
this made me to another person when my friends , when my friends , who believe that these forests of the aufenthaltsort of hukuk and the kannibalischen spirit are the nordende of the world , the spirit of the world , spirit they &apos;d participate in their hamatsa-initiation .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i was only taken in april of the amazon april .
this is ayahuasca , from the many of you have heard , the most powerful assets from the repertoire of the schamanen .
what makes an amazing thing , is not just the most powerful potential of this präparats , which is a series of the potential potential of this präparats , but it &apos;s a matter of two different sources , and it &apos;s kind of halluzinogen , which is something like a blue trüber smoke on your mind , but it &apos;s going to be with the leaves of a strauchs from the family &apos;s family called psychotria vermischt viridis .
and this plant contains a few very strong people who are very similar to the serotonin , dimethyltryptamin-5 and methoxydimethyltryptamin .
if you &apos;ve seen the yanomami , as you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this substance , this substance , this substance , which is also methoxydimethyltryptamin .
the powder powder is something like from a gewehrlauf shot , gesäumt of barocken paintings , and landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to create verzerrung reality , but the resolution of reality .
in fact , i have with my professor , richard shultes shultes , the man who had the psychedelische ärea , in mexico , in mexico , and i said , you know , you know , you couldn &apos;t stand this tryptamine as a halluzinogen , because in the moment you feel the impact , you &apos;re not there to experience a halluzination .
but the thing about tryptaminen is that they can &apos;t be taken oral , because they &apos;re in a human intestine , of course with names with names with names called monoamin-oxidase , denaturiert .
they can only oral with some other chemicals that the mao denaturieren .
now the fascinating thing is that the betakarboline that are in the liane , mao-inhibitoren , from the one of the way that is necessary to potenzieren the tryptamine . so ask yourself .
how can these people get from the 80.000 species of the plants that don &apos;t find these two related plants , who , if they put together in this way , a kind of biochemischer version , so that it &apos;s bigger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trial and mistakes that it turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask the indians , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the cofan , have 17 varieties of ayahuasca , they all recognize them in the forest in the forest for our eyes as a way .
and then you ask them how they put their taxonomie and they say , &quot; i thought you &apos;re thinking about plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties of vollmond , and you put them in a different tonlage .
now , that doesn &apos;t get you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count .
now , the problem is the problem that we have to have the sympathy for the difficult position of native , you know , you know , you have to look at the schwierige , but you &apos;re going to look at the past , as the real world , that is our world .
so , the fact that you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century or a technical innovation , but rather than an era where we present to , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth will either be actively actively aktiv , so the problem is not the change .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new lebenmöglichkeiten .
and the problem is not the technology .
the sioux-indianer stopped being less on sioux , when americans stopped being americans , when americans stopped being americans , when they were a horse and pferdewagen tasks .
not change , and technology the integrity of ethnosphäre the integrity , it &apos;s power . it &apos;s ugly face of sovereignty .
so , as you can see in the world , you know , these cultures are not untergang , you know , you know , these cultures are not the end of the untergang in southeast asia , and you &apos;re going to see that these cultures are not the end of the untergang , and they &apos;re going to be verdrängt in the horizon , which is willing to be ready to fill their schiffsräume , they have to fill their schiffsräume with raw baumstämmen , which they &apos;re willing to fill on the forest with raw the forest , or , in the case of yanomami , where they are krankheitsträger , which were krankheitsträger during the goldrauschs .
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i neuerlich a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the phyische extinction from people in general , but the ethnozid , the destruction of the people &apos;s lives , isn &apos;t just convicted , but in general and vielerorts as part of a entwicklungsstrategie .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering , if you haven &apos;t experienced it at unterster level .
i used to travel with a young colleague of 6,000 miles from chengdu to tibet , and only when i came to tibet , i heard the face of the statistics of whom you hear . 6,000 6,000 monuments that have been turned and turned into schutt , 1.2 1.2 million people who have been murdered during the cultural revolution .
the father of this young manns was identified as the followers of panchen lama .
that meant that he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle , to the diaspora in the diaspora that people brought to nepal .
his mother was locked in as punishment punishment for -- to be wealthy for the crime .
he was geschmuggelt at the age of two years old to hide under her rockzipfel , because she couldn &apos;t live without it .
the sister who did this brave act was brought into a erziehungslager .
one day , they stepped up on a armband maos , and they had to go into a armband camp for seven years .
the suffering can be unerträglich , but the erlösende spirit mind of people is something unvergessliches .
and at the end , we really get a choice . would we want to be in a monochromatischen world of monotonie or in a polychromatischen world of diversity ?
margaret mead , the great anthropologist , before she died , it &apos;s their greatest fear that , as she died , we can &apos;t only move the entire range of human imagination on a eingeengte thinking , but that one day from a dream in a dream , and forgot that there was ever any other options .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species has been there for 600,000 years .
the neolithische revolution that brought us agriculture , and at this moment of the kult of saatkorns unterwarf , the poetry of schamanen , through the prosa and hierarchy , and hierarchy and hierarchy , specialization -- found only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this superficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges we &apos;re facing in the next millennia .
if we ask these myriad weltkulturen to the importance of human beings , they answer with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to get the opportunity to be able to do what we are : people who are aware of the minds that are aware that all humans and gardens have to flourish a space , and there are great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took in the northern end of the baffin-inseln , when i went to narwhal-jagd with inuits , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the eastern government is not always very good at the inuit , and during the 50iger years of the etablierung of our domination , they were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather refused to be that old man .
the family , the fear of his life , took all the guns and all the tools .
now you have to know the inuit are not afraid of the cold . they used to use them to their advantage .
the gleitschienen of her schlitten were originally made of fish in karibu-haut .
the guy &apos;s grandfather was not frightened of the mannes night or the white storm .
he schlüpfte out , he made his pants off of seehundsfell and defäkierte in his hand , and when the feces began to cold , he formed it into the form of a messers .
he &apos;s speichel on the side of the fäkalien-messers , and it was completely frozen , he erstach a dog .
he enthäutete the dog , and improvisierte , and improvisierte the skeleton of the dog &apos;s skeleton and improvisierte a schlitten , spannte another dog and entschwand on the eisschollen with the fäkalien-messer .
you can &apos;t do anything like this .
and this is a symbol of a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all the native in the world .
the eastern government gave the inuit in april 1999 , the entire control of a field that &apos;s bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new home . it &apos;s called nunavut .
it &apos;s an independent area . you control all the mineralvorkommen .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can search for people and reach .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have traveled to these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they &apos;re the heimatländer of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that are zurückreichen in the past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children are going to be part of the geography of hope .
ultimately , what we &apos;re going to do at national geographic is that we believe that politicians never achieve something .
we believe that polemik -- we believe that polemik is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world , our website gets 35 million hits every month .
156 nations send our fernsehkanal .
our magazines will read by millions .
and we &apos;re going to take a series of trips to places from such cultural wonder that we &apos;re going to take our audiences into places of such cultural wonder that the world has earned to exist in different ways that we can find a lebensmöglichkeit in a really multicultural pluralistischen world where the wisdom of all human beings can contribute to our common well-being .
thank you .
what i &apos;m going to show you , as quickly as quickly as possible , a new technology that we &apos;re going to do as a part of a year ago , just a year , and it &apos;s seadragon , and it &apos;s an environment where they can either get locally or take huge amounts of visual data .
we see many , many of the gigabytes of digital photographs here that are nahtlos and continuously heranholen , schwenken , in any way , in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is , for example , for example , and it &apos;s in a part of 300 megapixeln .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that the performance of a system can be like this is the number of pixels on your screen at every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of nichtbild-daten .
this is bleak house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it really is a text and not about a picture , we can actually do something like this to really show that this is a real representation of texts and no picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a e-buch .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a realistischerer case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a abschnitts .
and that &apos;s really the pleasure and the good experience to read a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with a bunch of scales .
we also did something about the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a false display with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal ad , and we added extra content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see you here .
or other models , or even technical specs .
and this really reaches these ideas to stop those limitations for the available place on the screen .
we hope that this is not a pop-ups and other nonsense , which should not be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re also going to contribute to this area .
but these are all the streets in the u.s.
übereinandergelagert up on the erdräumlichen picture of nasa .
so let &apos;s get something out now .
this is actually live on the internet . you can nachprüfen it .
this is a project called photosynth , which really connects two different technologies together .
one is seadragon , and the other one is a very good research on computervision , which is a noah snavely , a universitätsstudenten university of the university of steve seitz at the uw .
and rick szeliski was done by microsoft research . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by seadragon .
you can see that when we &apos;re creating these kinds of views that we can penetrate through images and make this experience of mehrfachen resolution .
but the spatial structure of the images is actually meaning .
and these pictures have these images together , so they put these pictures together , where they were all made in the kanadischen in the kanadischen in the canadian rockies , in the canadian . they &apos;re looking at the elements of stabilisierten slides , or panoramischer bildverarbeitung , and these things were gesetzt in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know if i still have time to show you other environments .
there are the ones that are much more räumlicher .
and i &apos;d like to show you one of the originalen datensätze of noah , and this is from a early prototype of a noah that we &apos;ve been working on to show , which is really the punchline to that technology , which is photosynth-technologie , and this is not necessarily so obvious if you look at the environments we have on the website .
we had to make care about the lawyers .
so this is a rekonstruktion of the cathedral lady , which was erfolgte on the computer with images of flickr , and you &apos;ll just give you images in flickr , and you &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and so on , and so on . each of this orange , a picture represents , represents a picture that was discovered as to this model .
so these are all flickr-bilder , and all of them are in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i will work at microsoft microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
i guess you can see that this is a lot of different types of cameras : everything is , from the handy-kamera to professional slrs , a pretty large number of them that were all zusammengeflickt in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the weird .
many of you are verdeckt by faces .
there &apos;s a series of photographs here -- they &apos;re here .
this is actually a poster from notre dame dame that was really recorded .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with the social environment , and it &apos;s going to get data from all of the collective memory of collective memory , like , visual the earth -- and everything will be connected .
all these photographs are going to connect with each other , and it creates something bigger than the sum of the parts .
you get a model that comes out of all the earth .
look at this when the sequel of stephen lawlers of stephen lawlers on virtual earth .
and this is something that people use by the complexity that people use , growing and its use of the user with the user with the application .
their own photos are going to have a metadaten , which is a different person .
and if someone who &apos;s all of the sacred , and you can tell you who are all of the sacred , and you can tell you who are all of this data , and i can use it as a starting point to go into this room , in these metaverse , the photos of other people , and make a kind of übergreifender modaler of social experience with the use of other people .
and of course , nebenprodukt , all of this is the immense virtual virtual virtual models of the earth that don &apos;t just get through überflüge or satellite images and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
i &apos;m right ? your software is that at a certain time , within the next years , all the images that are used to be used in the world are essentially associated with each other ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t matter anything .
if you want to do it between the images .
and it &apos;s doing this because of the content in the images .
and this is really exciting when you think about the fülle of the information that many of these images have .
how if you do a websuche for images , where you put sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what &apos;s picture .
but what if the picture you tied up with all your images ?
then the volume of semantischen querverbindung and the abundance that makes it make up is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic netzwerkeffekt .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of things from my book , as i hope , with other things you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make myself a few connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed these .
i want to start with what i call official dogma .
the official dogma of what ?
the official glaubenssatz of all the western industrialized societies .
so the official dogma works like this : if our goal is to maximize the common good of our citizens , it &apos;s all about the maximierung of the freedom of freedom .
and the reason that is that freedom is good , valuable , valuable , a sense of sense , a unverzichtbare premise .
if people have freedom , each one of us is about to do the things that are our common public , and nobody has to decide for us .
the freedom to maximize is a choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common they have .
this is , i think , in our water supply of water that it would be no question to question .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say something about salatdressing .
there &apos;s 175 dressings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t get the 10 different extra olivenöle , and you can &apos;t buy 12 balsamico-essig that you could buy around a large number of your salat , in the unlikely , that none of the world &apos;s going to be right for you .
so that &apos;s what the supermarket is .
and then they go to the verbraucher-elektronik business for a stereo -- speaker , cd-player , ein , verstärker , verstärker , verstärker , and in this one electronics , there &apos;s so many stereo facilities .
we can put together millions of different stereo devices from the components that are offered a business .
you have to admit that this is a great choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , when i was able to put up every telephone on the hand , as long as he got his bell bell .
they rented her phone . they rented it .
a consequence of that was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we have almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- mp3-player- , nasen-haar-trimmer and crème fackel brûlée .
and if you haven &apos;t seen it yet in your business , you can be sure that you &apos;re going to get it soon .
and what it does is it makes people walk into business and ask this question .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , which is very much more like buying objects , the same explosion of choice .
healthcare -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and tell you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could make a do or we could make b .
a have the benefits .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
doctor , it says a benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
and the result -- we call autonomy autonomy . it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , we call autonomy autonomy of the burden of decisions from someone who knows something to someone who knows nothing to someone who knows nothing and most likely ill , and therefore , the best constitution is a decision to make -- namentlich the patient .
there is an enormous marketing for people like you and me , that if you think about it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they werben us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you expect us to call us the doctor in the next morning and ask a change of the prescription .
so , something like our identity is now a question of choice to show the slide .
we don &apos;t get identity ; we invent them .
and we &apos;re as often as often as we want .
that means that every day if you wake up the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where almost everyone had one of them , and they could heirateten as fast as they could , and then children quickly got kids as quickly as they could .
the only true choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , not what they did .
now , it &apos;s all easy .
i teach at wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give them 20 percent less work than i did .
and not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i get married or not ? should i get married now ?
should i get married later ? should i have kids just a career or a career ? &quot;
these are all einnehmende questions .
and you will answer those questions regardless of whether it means that means that i &apos;m going to give you the tasks and not a good grade in my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to beantwortende questions .
work -- we are blessed , as carl pointed , with the technology that allows us every minute of every day to work on the planet -- until the randolph hotel hotel .
there &apos;s actually a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell anyone who &apos;s going to work .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of work , again , again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can look at our kids in soccer , watching football , and we have our mobile phone , and our blackberry to others , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and even if you &apos;re all off , every minute in our child at the verstümmeln , we &apos;re asking ourselves , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be your experience of your child &apos;s experience as well as it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , is a question of choice .
and the world we lived in this way .
and i want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world we live in now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to think about what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
an effect , paradoxer way , is that it lähmt lähmt .
with so many options that you can choose , people can be very hard to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another drastisches example of investing in volunteers .
one colleague of me had access to investitions-akten of vanguard , the giant fondgesellschaft of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was pro the employer of the employer anbot , took care about two percent .
they offer 50 investmentfonds -- 10 percent less employees than if they would just offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investmentfonds who are a choice of choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide what to choose that you put it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow and then , tomorrow and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course never come .
understand that this is not only that people need to eat food , when they go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to the tank , it also means that decisions are so hard that they are missing great investitionsangebote of their employer .
it &apos;s not participation in participation to 5,000 u.s. up to 5,000 u.s. dollars per year , which would have been happy to reproduce .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it &apos;s worried that the world looks like this .
you want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to vote the wrong investment fund , or at all the wrong salatdressing .
so this is an effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end less pleased with the outcome of choice , as if we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is , by the big selection of different salatdressings , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and it &apos;s not perfect -- and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what &apos;s going on is this bildlich alternative alternative alternative , that you make the decision that regret , you regret , and that regret seems negative to the satisfaction that you had , even if it was a good decision .
the more possibilities there is , the more simple it &apos;s not any regrets to regret is to regret for the choice they meet .
secondly , what economists call oppertunitätskosten .
dan gilbert made a big point in this morning by telling people how much the way we judge things depends on what we compare .
well , if there is a lot of alternatives to think about , it &apos;s just an attractive properties of alternatives that they leave , that makes them less pleased with the alternatives that they &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorker , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should think .
here &apos;s a couple of things .
very expensive properties .
beautiful beach . a great day . you have everything for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; damn &quot; the man , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my manhattener neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly in front of my house . &quot;
and he &apos;s spent two weeks of the thought that he has followed the opportunity to have missed the opportunity day , day , a great parking lot .
oppertunitätskosten , the happiness that we get through our choices , also , when what we have chosen is a fantastic .
and the more possibilities there are , the more attractive properties of these choices are going to take into account .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon makes some statements .
he makes a statement about that in now , and maybe things about things slowly .
but a very important point that he &apos;s doing is always , who you decide for one thing , you don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things like a lot of attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to do what they &apos;re going to do less powerful .
three : eskalation the expectations .
this hit me when i wanted to replace my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there was only one of kind of some way , and they bought them , and they bought them , and they were incredibly unkomfortabel , and if they had it long enough , and they had washed enough , they started &quot; ok , &quot; ok .
so , to get new jeans to buy new jeans for a lot of years , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the verkäufer said , &quot; do you want schlanke , or weite or long ?
do you want the buttons or reißverschluss ? or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
if you want to cut far away , kegelig , blah blah blah , blah , blah , blah , blah and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like the way that used to be the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour with all these bloody bloody jeans , and then the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best appropriate jeans jeans i ever had .
i had better . all of these choices allowed me to have better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it myself .
the reason that i felt worse with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what a good pair of a good , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when it was in some way .
when they came up in 100 ways , you know , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had expected to do , and what i was expected to be disappointing compared to what i was expecting .
so , in the lives of the people in humans , in the lives of humans , need to have to have to have expectations about how well these people are going to be .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of marketings knows that , because if you would , you don &apos;t all know what this is about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that used to be better than everything was worse than everything was worse , it was possible to be able to experience experiences for people who were a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world that we live -- we live , industrialized citizens , in perfection as an expectation -- the best thing you can ever hope to hope is things as good as you expect .
they &apos;re never going to be pleasant überrascht. because their expectations , my expectations .
the secret to the glücklichkeit -- that &apos;s what they all came -- the secret to the glücklichkeit are low expectations .
i want to say -- a quick autobiographischer moment -- i &apos;m married to a woman , and it &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t have niedergelassen .
but niederlassen is not always a bad thing .
ultimately , a consequence of kaufens , if there is just a way to buy a way to buy it , if you &apos;re left there , and you ask yourself why , who is responsible , the answer is that answer is responsible . what could you do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of different jeans are available , and you &apos;re going to buy a enttäuschend , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is you .
they could have done it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it , they &apos;re giving themselves .
clinical depression exploded to the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a signifikanter -- not the only one -- not the only one of the only , but a signifikanter beiträger to that explosion , is that people are so high , because their standards are so high , and then , if you have to explain these experiences themselves , think it would be their fault .
and so that &apos;s what is that it &apos;s a generally better , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remember .
this is the official dogma that we all think is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that is a little bit better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choice is better than something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time , we &apos;ve missed our common public .
now , as a rule -- i &apos;m almost done as a thing -- i &apos;m almost done as a rule of thinking about it . what all of these choices enabled in the industrialized societies , is wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of you , whose problem is not too much .
your problem is that you have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and upset is , steve levitt has told you yesterday about how these expensive and hard to installierenden car seats , it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help .
they even hurt .
so you worry about that we are worse .
if something about what makes people of our society to make the societies that people have moved to little choices in people where people have shifted too little choices , not only would life improve of people , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this a pareto-verbesserungs application .
it &apos;s going to make sure that it &apos;s all the better -- not only the poor -- because of all these big selection .
finally , you read this cartoon , and , you know , a developed person who says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know , there &apos;s nothing possible in this goldfischglas . &quot;
verarmten imagination , a kurzsichtige view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
the more i was thinking about it , the more i got to think about the fish .
because the truth is that if you break the goldfischglas , so you have no freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the goldfischglas , so you get the happiness down .
it increases the paralysis and reduce happiness .
everyone needs a goldfischglas .
this is almost limited with perfect security -- possibly the fish , definitely for us .
but the abhanden of a metaphorical goldfischglas is a prescription , a recipe for misery , and i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects earlier , about the human genome and what could mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized our biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by building new lives and building .
we always tried to ask significant questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think that many biologists are trying to understand and it &apos;s on different levels .
we &apos;ve been trying to simplify different approaches to simplify the minimum components .
we &apos;ve digitized nearly 20 years when we sequenced the humangenom of the analog world of biology to the digital world of biology .
now we &apos;re trying to ask whether we can be able to be able to live , or can we make new life from this digital universe ?
so this is a map of a small organism , in mycoplasma , the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to be able to reach with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve managed to get a hundred genes on a hundred genes from the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at this metabolische map , which is very simple , compared to our -- trust me , that &apos;s simple , but if we all look at these genes that we can eliminate one after another , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way that it &apos;s the only way to synthesize what allows us to vary the individual components and make some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
does the chemistry allow these really big molecules to do , what hasn &apos;t been done before ?
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of inertes chemical material .
our steps in the digitalisierung of life were exponentially .
now , our ability to write genetic code has been evolving very slowly but increased , and our last point is now an exponential curve .
we started 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years starting with a bioethischen review review before we did the first experiments .
as it turns out , it turns out very hard .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters , but it &apos;s a degenerativer process , so the longer you &apos;re doing a piece , the more error happen .
so we had to develop a new method with which we could put these little pieces together and make mistakes .
this is our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
we made little pieces , and they made a fehlerkorrektur molecule , and they had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of inerte chemical and put the bacteria into a bacterium , and the bacteria began to read the genetic code and made viral particles .
so the viral particles then opened up by the cells , and they would come back and kill coli .
i &apos;ve talked to the oil industry recently , and they said that she &apos;s really understood this model .
they laughed more than you &apos;re doing this .
so we think that this is a situation in the software , actually , in the software , can actually build your hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go too much further , and we wanted to build an entire bakterielles chromosome , and we wanted to build an entire bakterielles chromosome , and so we thought we &apos;re building it in kassetten from the size of the virus that we could vary the size of the kassetten , which is the individual components of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , these digital information must be really accurate accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the fehlerrate was in a mistake per 10,000 base .
we found the resequenzieren 30 mistakes . if we used the original sequence , it would have never been possible .
and part of the design is to make the pieces of 50 letters for the 50 letters , and you have to make a smaller sub-einheiten to make these fit together that these fit .
we &apos;ve got the unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have built waterzeichen .
think about it : we have a 4-buchstaben code : a , c , g and t. .
triplets of these letters -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids ; and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we were just signed up .
some people were disappointed that it was no poetry .
we &apos;re constructed the pieces so that we could just break them down with enzymes , and there are enzymes these enzymes and put them together .
and we have started to make pieces , starting with the pieces of five to siebentausend letters , in these together , in order to put together these together , to zusammenzufügen these together .
in every step , we &apos;ve produced these pieces of surplus that we could sequence them because we tried to build a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
so , it looks like a basketball-playoff .
when we get to these really big pieces -- over 100,000 basenpaaren -- then they &apos;re not going to grow in e. e. , and it goes beyond the modern molecular biology , and so we applied to other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of homologe rekombination , which is using biology to repair dna that can put pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s one organism called deinococcus radiodurans of the three million rads of radiation .
you can see in the upper field that his chromosome just falls apart .
so 12 to 24 hours later , everything would put together together as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely ausgetrocknet , they can even live in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life exists in space and can move , looking for aquatischen conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of them out there .
this is a gefügeaufnahme of the molecule that we made by using these processes -- in fact , we used to use hefe-mechanismen with the right design of the pieces of the pieces we have , and yeast adds them together .
this is not a elektronenmikroskopaufnahme mikroskopaufnahme .
it &apos;s a big molecule that we can even see with the lichtmikroskop .
these are footage over a long period .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve only done recently .
this is about 580.000 &apos;s letters in genetischem code , it &apos;s the largest molecule that has ever created by people .
it has a molekulargewicht from over 300 million .
if we put it up with a schriftgröße of 10 and without distances , it would include pages of pages , just about these genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we turn it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s as simple as if you &apos;re doing it , you just take the nucleus out and give you a different in , and that &apos;s what you all heard about .
in archaebakterien , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but only recently , we &apos;ve shown that you can get a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another , and it can activate .
so we could choose the chromosome of a mikrobenspezies , and so , roughly , these two two times , we could choose the chromosome to all the proteins , and we &apos;re going to pick up the chromosome of all the proteins and it was quite amazing when we put it in a cell -- and they &apos;re going to estimate our very ausgereiften graphics .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we tried to get a little further the process .
this is the hauptmechanismus of the evolution here .
we find all sorts of species here that have taken a second chromosome , or a third of irgendwoher , every time thousands of characteristics in just one of a second is hinzufügend .
so , people who think of evolution as a gene that has changed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called the restriktionsenzyme , which actually digest dna .
the chromosome that it was in the cell is no ; the chromosomes we put in there .
it was exprimiert in the cell , and i realized the other chromosome as a foreign material material , and so we just had a cell with a new chromosome .
it was verfärbte blue because of the genes that we put on .
and after a very short time , all of the characteristics of species had lost and konvertierte , based on a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given into the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we transferiert .
it may sound like genomische alchimie , but we can , by verschieben , we can change things pretty dramatic .
now i argued that this is not the genesis -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years .
and i argued that we may be able to create a new form of the ocean explosion in which there could be massive new artenbildung based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re at nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to ask it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet are in 1946 , within 40 years , it &apos;s going to be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 30-plus billion barrels of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million barrels a day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace this , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 of this material on the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries from all the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the designkomponenten of the future .
the elektronikindustrie had a dozen components , and you see the diversity that came out of it .
we &apos;re stoßen in the limits of biological reality and those of our imagination .
we &apos;ve got technologies today because of these fast synthesemethoden to do what we call kombinatorische genetics .
now , we have the ability to build a large robot to build the millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine trying to make those 20 million different genes , or to optimize those processes to optimize these processes to create oktan , or drugs , we can change a little bit more molecular molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just nurmale selection . we can look at lebensfähigkeit selektieren , production of chemicals or treibstoffproduktion and so on .
this is a shot of actual design-software that we &apos;re working on , where you actually sit down and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like . we know exactly how the genetic code will look like .
we &apos;re focusing on based on the fourth generation .
you &apos;ve just seen corn on ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we have some of the zweiten- and third generation which is relatively soon coming out will be a lot of more zuckerwertigkeiten , like oktan or different kinds of butanol .
but how we think , the only kind of biology is a huge impact on the cost of food or the verfügbarkeit of their availability , if we see co2 co2 as an information material , and so we &apos;re working on cells that are going to the way .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first one with treibstoffen the fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is a organism we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about ein-einhalb miles deep , in almost kochenden wassertemperaturen .
it &apos;s sort of methane in methane the use of hydrogen as a source of energy .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use co2 footprint , which could simply be brought into produktionsplätzen , konvertieren co2 in fuel to drive this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the basic questions of life .
you know , we really have -- moderate targets goals like the ersatz of the entire petrochemischen industry . right . if you could not do that at ted , where else ? a hauptquelle of energy .
but in the same way we &apos;re working on doing the same way that we are using vaccines .
you saw it this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back , and we have a dollar too little , when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that &apos;s changed by creating rekombinante vaccines of vaccines .
that &apos;s how the future might be able to look at the way that the future might be accelerating with synthetic bacteria , archaen , and perhaps eukaryonten .
we &apos;re getting light years to improve people . our goal goal is that we have a chance to survive for a long time to do that . thank you very much .
at the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all those at the time , the lhc was the biggest scientific experiment that was ever addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .
and his job is to make the conditions that are less than a milliardstel second in the beginning of the universe -- and it existed to 600 million times in a second .
it &apos;s just gorgeous ambitious .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we &apos;re taking images of these mini-urknalle in detectors .
this is what i work on . he &apos;s called an atlas -- 44 44 meters in the diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction that you see the scale .
on september 10 last year , the machine was going to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
there are huge jubel in the control control .
it &apos;s a picture of the first strahlenpartikels that the entire track of the lhc , and then , using a part of the lhc , to make a regen of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on 10th 10th , we knew that the machine works , which is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was the biggest jubel of creating , or this is when someone was visiting the google side and found the front page .
it means we reached a cultural impact next to scientific science .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires -- these golden wires here .
these wires lead 13-tausend when the machine goes on hochleistung .
well , the engineers under them will look at them and say , &quot; no they do it . these are little wires . &quot;
you can do that because you &apos;re very far down , you &apos;re going to be called supraleitern .
so at minus 271 degrees , kälter , as the space between the stars , these wires wires that wires .
in one of the connections , between neuntausend magnets , there was a manufakturdefekt .
and so the wires geringfügig and 13-tausend ampere , suddenly widerstand resistance .
this was the result .
now , all of this is wonderful , when you imagine that the magnets goes over 20 tons and shifted about 30 inches .
so we beschädigten about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we did .
we neu them , reparierten them .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
at the end of march , the lhc will be funktionsfähig again .
we &apos;re going to turn it up and expect the first data on june , and expect the first data on june , and use our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , in a way that accidents these accidents are again erneut the value of science and ingenieurskunst in borders . it &apos;s easy to reject something like that .
i think it &apos;s so hard to be the fact that we reach across our borders are the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to ask my abschließenden words , for a english scientist , humphrey davy , who said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind , as to consider that our scientific ideas , &quot; is that there is no mystery in nature that our triumphe are vollzählig , and there are no new worlds to conquer . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my profession , but of course , of course , it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change .
however , recent a little bit weird in my life and my career has happened to me to rethink my relationship with this work completely .
this curious event was that i wrote a book -- a biography called „ eat , pray , pray , love -- that , unlike all my previous books went out of the world for some reason , and a big mega-ereignis international bestseller-ding .
the result is that i don &apos;t matter where i get treated , as if i &apos;m being treated .
seriously -- the untergang .
so , for example , you &apos;re worried about me , and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that success will never be übertreffen ?
don &apos;t you worry about it , that you have a whole lifetime of your life , and you never create a book that anyone in the world ? never again ?
okay , it &apos;s really courage .
it would be worse if i &apos;m not going to remember that , over 20 years ago , when i first told a writer for the first time , i wanted to be faced with the same kind of angstbesetzter response .
people said , „ did you have no fear of having never succeeded ?
do you not worry that the humiliation kills you a absage ?
you don &apos;t worry that you &apos;re going to spend your life for your life , and you never get a little bit of a schrotthaufen dreams , and you &apos;re going to die on a schrotthaufen dreams -- your mouth filled your mouth ?
you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions : „ .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had .
and i &apos;m still a lot more things that no one would .
like algae -- and other furchteinflößende things .
but if it &apos;s writing about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about this , and i ask myself , why ?
is it reasonable ?
is it logical that people should be expected to do the work that he &apos;s going to make ?
and what &apos;s going on with the creative project is that they make us secure about the other economic leaders -- in a way , how do other professions do it ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can remember the situation in his 40 years as a chemist when he was asked to be afraid to be a chemist .
with your chemiker-blockade , john -- how are you doing it ?
it just didn &apos;t work , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists didn &apos;t get the reputation of alkoholsüchtigen manisch-depressive people .
we seem to have a writer , but not just the writers , but not just the writers , but the creative of all genres seem , seem to have this reputation , mentally unstable .
all they need to do is to look at the bitter todeszahlen of the 20th century , who died young and often died of their own .
and even the ones that don &apos;t actually begingen begingen , seemed to be really neglected by their talent .
norman mailer said to his last interview in his last interview interview : „ , every one of my books .
a extraordinary statement that you can do about your work .
but what we don &apos;t even do , when we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve seen somebody like this , because we &apos;ve seen this kind of statements for so long , and a collective , that creativity and suffering somehow of course , of course , of course , and that art -- at the end of the end -- always leads to seelenqual .
the question i want to ask everyone here today is : is this idea for you all right ?
if you look at that , because only one centimeter apart -- i don &apos;t feel about that perception .
i find them abscheulich .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see how it &apos;s going to take over the next century .
i think it better when we encourage our great creative encouraging .
and i definitely know that it was -- in my situation -- very dangerous , very dangerous to start this dark path of the conjecture , sort of herunterzusickern -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career .
that &apos;s called -- i &apos;m quite young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i might have another 40 arbeitsjahre in myself .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to be doing from the world is going to be the world &apos;s work , which is going to be the work of the past book , right ?
i &apos;m saying it because we &apos;re all right now , we &apos;re all of my friends -- it &apos;s very likely to be my biggest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thought that you can get someone to get at nine o &apos;clock in the morning , to drink . and i don &apos;t want that .
i &apos;d rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
so , after some time , it seems to me to be writing a kind of writing a form of schützendem psychological construct psychological construct .
so , somehow i have to find a way of writing a safe distance into true between me and my very natural beklemmung on how the reaction will be on the writing .
and as i was looking for models of models for models to do this , i was looking for models in the past year , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if you might have better or more or more , as we can help creative help with the emotional risks that are connected with creativity .
this search for me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of göttlicher diener-geist , which is from a distant , unknown source to people -- from unerklärlichen , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this divine diener-geister of creativity of creativity „ .
from socrates , he thought he would have a dämon who was mitteilte him from a distance .
the roman had the same idea , called this kind of körperlosem creative mind , a „ genius .
that &apos;s great . the roman didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they believed that there was a genius of a magical creature , which was , in the walls , they were literally living in the walls of a künstlerateliers -- something like dobby , the hauself -- the rauskäme and the artist in the work in a sense invisible invisible to the outcome of the work .
that &apos;s brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological to protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked so , right ?
the artist of altertums was protected , like , like , for example , too much narzissmus , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew that you had this körperlose genius that helped you .
when your work floppte -- not completely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew your genius was paralyzed .
so people in the west really thought about creativity long .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea , and we had this big idea : let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- about all the gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no room more for mythical creatures to embrace orders from the divine .
it &apos;s the beginning of the reason , and the people began to believe that creativity completely came from their own individual .
for the first time in history , people hear about this or call a genius , rather than instead of doing a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know , and i think it &apos;s going to allow you to allow you to allow you to let &apos;s think , or it &apos;s the vessel of all divine , creative , unbekanntem , infinite mysteriums is a little too much more responsible to a lot of responsibility to make you a fragilen , human psyche .
it &apos;s like to ask someone to eat the sun .
it entstellt and distorted whole egos , and it creates all of these unerreichbaren expectations of success .
i think that erfolgs-druck our artists has wiped out the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true -- and i think it &apos;s true .
can we change it ?
maybe an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can not just auslöschen rational for a 500 years in a 18-minütigen talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience , who really berechtigte scientific doubt about the notion of -- it &apos;s basically -- feen people , and apply to their projects on their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to put in put is : why not ?
why not think about it that way ?
because it makes a lot of sense like everything else that i &apos;ve heard , when it went to explain the absolutely crazy machende of the creative process .
a process that has ever been trying to do something -- so in other words , in other words , everyone here -- not always acts .
in fact , he can feel really paranormal .
i recently had a close encounter when i was about 90 american poet ruth stone stone stone , but she told me that she was growing up in the fields of virginia in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear her feel like a poem about the landscape on them .
she said it would be like a donnernder train .
the country on the country would be zurollen .
she felt if it came to , because it would bring the earth under her feet .
she knew that she could do a moment in such a moment , and this was -- in their words -- „ race like the devil .
she ran like the devil was verfolgt by this poem , and it was about the fact that she had to get enough to a piece of paper and a pencil , so that they could capture when they could capture them and to capture on the sheet .
so , she wasn &apos;t fast . she ran and ran and ran and ran the poem through her and she missed it , and she told it , and she said , and she said , and she said , and she said , and she said it was going to go to the land and -- as she said -- „ after another poet .
and then there were those moments -- i &apos;ll never forget -- she said that there were moments where they were almost missing it .
so , she runs out of the house and she &apos;s looking for paper , and the poem goes through her , and she picks up a pencil , and she picks up a pencil , and then -- she said -- it was as if it was going to reach with her other hand and grab it .
and she caught the poem on his tail and he took it back in her body and took it to the sheet of paper .
in these opportunities , the poem was fully intact and the paper -- but backwards -- the last word for the first word .
when i heard that , i thought i was unheimlich -- that &apos;s just like my creative process .
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a maultier . to work to work , i have to get up every day and sweat , and schwitzen and really unangenehm , and really uncomfortable .
but even myself , in my maultierart , sometimes i have this thing .
and i guess many of you have done that .
and i had work or ideas from a source of a source through me that i really can &apos;t identify .
what is that for a thing ?
and how do we connect with this relationship with without losing our minds , but to keep ourselves in intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example of how you can do this is to be the musicians , and i got to interview him a few years ago for a magazine .
we talked about this subject , and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the embodiment of gepeinigten modern artist artist who was trying to master and deal with them .
but then he got older and quiet . he told me that one day on a schnellstraße schnellstraße in los angeles , and then everything changed for him .
he was driving a little bit when he suddenly hear a little bit of a tune , as he suddenly &apos;s making a little bit of quälend , greifbar , and he wants to have it , and he &apos;s prachtvoll . it &apos;s prachtvoll , he &apos;s lechzt , but he can &apos;t believe it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper ; he doesn &apos;t have a pen ; he doesn &apos;t have a pen .
so he starts to get this old beklemmung in him , like „ i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be tracked by that song song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it .
but instead of getting out , he just stopped .
he ended up all of the thoughts and did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky , and he said , you can &apos;t see that i &apos;m going to drive ?
i &apos;m looking like that i could write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a günstigeren moment , if i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , somebody else is .
go and quäle leonard cohen .
his whole arbeitsprozess has changed after that .
not the work itself . that was still as dark as ever .
but the process and the heavy beklemmung that surrounds him was no more than what he was in trouble , where he caused nothing in trouble in trouble , where he was going from . he realized that it had to be a verinnerlichtes , quälendes thing .
it could be a eigentümliche , wonder , bizarre collaboration , a sort of a conversation between tom and the fremdartigen , of all , that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
when i &apos;ve heard this story , it was also a little bit of the way i worked , and it &apos;s already saved me .
so , in the middle of „ eat , pray , pray , love . i fell in the middle of „ , pray , pray , pray , love , and i fell into one of these things , and it doesn &apos;t work . you start thinking that it &apos;s a disaster . this is going to be the worst book that was ever written .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just einstampfen the project .
but then i remembered tom in the free sky , and i was trying to do it .
so i take my view of the manuscript and i spoke to my commentary towards a blank corner of the room .
i talked loudly , „ , you know , you , and i know , you know , if this book is not very brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i have everything i have , invest . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to show up here and follow the deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what the hell do .
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to go on the record that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like this . in a centuries , in a centuries of centuries , nordafrikas people had nordafrikas people to mondscheinfesten people with sacred dances and the music that were stopped for hours -- until dawn .
these strong were always great , because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but again , again , very rare , something special happened . one of the performers was actually überweltlich .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen a performance in your life .
it was as if the time was stillstehen and the dancers in a way of pforte , and he did not different from before -- 1,000 nights before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything added together .
and suddenly it &apos;s no longer seemed to be human .
it &apos;s lit up from the inside , from the inside , and everything is erhellt through a göttliches fire .
when something happened then , people knew what that was . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : „ allah , allah , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historical fußnote : when the mohren südspanien went into it , when the mohren went into the centuries of „ allah , allah , allah “ to „ olé , olé , allah “ , olé “ , that you still hear at stierkämpfen and flamenco-tänzen .
if an ecologist in spain has something impossible , something magic has done , „ , olé , olé , olé , great bravo , bravo unfassbar , there is : a flüchtiger view of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning , when the dancers wake up and realize that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock in a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer a fünkchen of god in it .
he &apos;s just a alternder sterblicher with schmerzenden knees , and maybe he will never go up to those heights .
and maybe somebody &apos;s never going to call god &apos;s name , if he turns . but what would he start with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most profound korrekturen of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be that full of pein if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence came from .
if you just believe that you &apos;re dying -- from a unvorstellbaren source of your life that &apos;s going to be passed on someone else if they &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking about it , everything changes .
so i started thinking , and i think , in the past months , as i was working on the book , it &apos;s going to be -- when the dangerous , scary , powerful nachfolger of my abgefahrenen success .
what i have to say to myself , if i &apos;m crazy about it , is not a fear .
isn &apos;t entmutigt .
just make your job .
be on the contribution for your contribution , whatever it may be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the dumb divine genius , you &apos;ve asked you to the side , for a brief moment , for a moment of wonder of wonder through your effort .
and if not , dance even dance your dance .
and „ olé ! “ for you .
i believe that , and i feel like we should teach that .
„ olé ! “ for you , despite all of this , just for being the mere human love and the eigensinn , to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
olé !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic eiskappe , which is the height for nearly three million years from the size of the lower 48 states to 40 percent to 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t press strong enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thickness of ice .
in a sense , the arctic eiskappe is the beating heart of our global klimasystems .
it grows in winter and schrumpft in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a zeitrafferaufnahme what happened in the last 25 years .
the dauereis is labeled with red .
as you can see , it grows on the dunkelblau . this is the annual ice of winter , and it schrumpft in summer .
the so-called dauereis , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which is from the body here .
over here , in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
this is a problem , because warming is the frozen reason to the arctic ocean to the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s big amounts of gefrorenem carbon dioxide , which is when he &apos;s going to auftaut from microbes to methane .
compared to the amount of klimaverändernden materials in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross that critical point .
already today in some flat lakes in a few flat lakes from itself from the water .
professor katey walter at the university in alaska is with another group to another flachen lake .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how will it be ergehen .
and one reason is that this enormous wärmespeicher expand greenland from the north .
this is a jährlicher tauwasserfluss .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is the kangerlussuaq river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the sea level of sea is rising into the sea .
these rivers are rapide .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest eismasse on the planet .
last month , researchers volunteered that the entire continent is now a negative eisbilanz .
and the westantarktis that showed over a couple of unterwasserinseln is particularly strong in the melt .
this corresponds to 20 feet , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the drittgrössten eismasse , you see up new lakes on top a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their trinkwassers from this schmelzwasser .
in the anden , this glacier is the trinkwasserquelle of the city .
the wassermengen have been expanding .
but if it &apos;s versiegen , the most of the drinking water .
in california , there was a 40 percent reduction in the schneedecke of sierra sierra .
it &apos;s betrifft .
and the predictions of how they read them are serious .
and this austrocknung around the world all over the world leads to a dramatic increase of a dramatic increase .
and the disasters all over the world have actually increased an unprecedented degree .
four times a lot of the last 30 years in the last 30 years .
this is a completely unhaltbares entwicklungsmuster .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it is .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 all 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day into the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific right , from the american continent western and beiderseits of the indian subkontinents , where there is a dramatic decline of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the lowest biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two major verschmutzer , combined with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of other kohlefabriken .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that were taken in the last few years with some green alternatives that were proposed .
trotzdessen is a political argument in our country .
and the kohleindustrien and ölindustrien have spent a viertelmilliarde dollar dollar last kalendarjahr to promote clean coal , which is already a contradiction .
this picture reminded me of something .
christmas , on christmas , at home , at home , at home , a billion tons of kohleschlamm .
they &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our entire country of zweitgrösste abfallfluss america .
this happened christmas christmas .
one of the ads of the kohleindustrie for christmas was that .
frosty der is a vergnügter , happy boy .
it &apos;s in skin and plenty in america , and it helps our economy to grow .
frosty , the kohlenmann is clean every day .
it &apos;s affordable and liebenswert , and workers are lohn and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful bergarbeiter is the head of massey coal .
let me say one clearly . al al gore , nancy pelosi , harry reid , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance of climate climate have been launched .
this is one , part of her .
in the coalergy , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
that &apos;s why we set up to spend a supreme zeil , which is to spend a significant geldsumme to spend a beträchtliche to the way to get the truth to the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells good .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let &apos;s leave it to us .
saueber coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean kohlefabrik .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean kohletechnologie .
and yet , the coal of coal is one of the main reasons to global warming , the remarkable clean kohletechnologie that you see here , changes everything changes .
look at this right , this is today , clean kohletechnologie .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security crisis , the climate crisis .
the red needle that connects them all , is our dependence on kohlenstoff-basierenden fuels like dirty coal and ausländisches oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to get us out of this misslichen situation .
versorge america with 100 percent clean electricity , within the next 10 years .
a plan to bring america back to work , make us safer and to help global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
versorge america . find more out .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a neuversorgung of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on old , dirty fuels that unsere our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create jobs .
versorge america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , walk alone .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
we have to get far , very quickly .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to start asking for you to go to the time when you were playing with bauklötzen .
while they realized how to take hands out of their hands , and they &apos;re going to be able to look at thinking and make problems through the understanding and change .
what spatial thinking is very closely connected to this , how we understand most of our environment .
so , as a computer -- by the kind of the kind of interaction of our interaction with real objects -- with my fachberater , and my colleagues , inspired by the kind of art , inspired by the kind of a flat arbeitsfläche -- ... what if we could intervene with both hands and make it physically take the data and organize it , how do we want it ?
this question was so emotional that we decided to explore the answer and developed siftables .
in short , one is an interactive computer in the size of a kekses .
you can be moved with your hand , you can detect each other , you can detect your movements , and you have a screen and a screen .
more importantly , are physically why you &apos;re physically , you know how to reach out of the hands and access .
and the siftables are an example of a new generation of hilfsmitteln to manipulation digital data .
and if these tools become physical and a conscious awareness of their movements , you can recognize each other and see the feinheiten of our umgangs with them , then we can start to explore new and more entertaining .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
so this siftable is for the videowiedergabe , and when i put it in a direction , the video will play forward , when i put it in the other direction , it &apos;s running backwards .
and these interactive portraits are taking each other .
so when i put them side-by-side , they make their interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by voneinader , you &apos;ll notice , and you can get something nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and slope .
an interesting consequence of the interactions we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures on data , like color , how to do this with liquids .
in this case , we have three siftables as a farbtöpfe konfiguriert , and i can use them to pour color in the middle , where they &apos;re then mixed together .
if we go to it , we can do a little bit .
there are also some nice opportunities in education as languages , mathematics or logikspiele , where we give people the possibility of fast and error and want to see the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a series of numbers that i make with a simple gleichungsprogramm .
this is a game with words that is kind of a mixture of scrabble and boggle .
so you basically , every round of runde , every round of siftable letters , and as you try to make words , you &apos;re going to geprüft this over a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , and you have a new buchstabenkombination and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some children who came to the media lab at the media lab , and i could move them to try and make it a video .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact in this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
everything you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people who are testing it .
this is our youngest beta-tester down there .
it turns out that he just wanted to stack up .
so for him , they were just bauklötze .
this is an interactive trickfilmanwendung .
we wanted to develop a lernmittel for sprachlerner .
that &apos;s felix .
he can bring new characters into the scene by putting the siftable from the table that shows this character .
here he leaves the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he gets a tractor into the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yeah !
by wearing the siftables , and you can put the characters together ...
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story to open up , and it can decide how it evolved .
flying cat .
the last example that i &apos;ve been doing now is to show you , is a musik-sequencer for live-auftritte , which we recently developed and in the siftables as sound , like führungsstimme , bass and drums .
each one has four different variations ; you can choose to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can put into certain patterns .
and you &apos;re speist them by simply holding a ton-siftable to a sequenz-siftable .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filter .
you connect it with a certain note , and it tends to make it .
and then even more sophisticated effects like speed and volume , which you apply on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we start when we &apos;re starting to führungsstimme in two sequenz-siftable , and put it in a row , and add a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something else to this .
and now i combine the filters with the drums so that i can control the effect live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by putting the pace into one or another .
and now i combine the filter with the bass , for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as you go through .
so i don &apos;t have to do it in the effort , but it can extend them in the way .
and finally , i can ausblenden the whole sequence by running the lautstärke-siftable .
thank you .
so as you can see , my desire is to develop new mensch-computer-schnittstellen , which are better to fit our brains and bodies .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new design-welt and some of the ways that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you on the way is that we &apos;re at the verge of this new generation of werzeugen to the digital media , which will bring information into our world , which is our demands .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m looking forward to the conversations with you all !
yes , good afternoon .
i &apos;m very excited to be there .
yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
i just have to step back a little bit , and it &apos;s engaging with the modern molecular biology .
i &apos;m studying molecular molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been doing it for a couple of years ago with the biohacking , and i started to know , because i wanted to know , and it really wanted to do what i &apos;ve learned in the study of the time .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get a kind of closer to the matter , like this .
i think , in general biology , in general , in general , biology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now it &apos;s already extremely important and much more important , much more important in the future .
there are so controversial things like these all genetically veränderten plants on the äckern .
now , there &apos;s craig venter in the u.s.a , trying to make biofuel , so that &apos;s benzin from algae .
under then , under then , there are some things that are totally in the ground , which are most people who are not aware of , for example , waschmittelenzyme that allow us to wash 40 degrees , are also genetically optimierte enzymes .
and the list can continue over .
and so from the interest in this technology , on this technology , i &apos;m just on there .
so why now hacken ?
most people know that from the softwarebereich .
computers , and then it &apos;s always going to the media in the media , yes , the hackers break somewhere and klauen data and so on .
it &apos;s kind of a very sad thing for hackerszene , because it &apos;s not true of what they actually started , and what &apos;s actually about it .
and that &apos;s what the software-hacker , in the &apos; 70s , starting with computerbasteln , and it &apos;s also formed the internet .
and it &apos;s about acting with playful , creative , real way to solve a problem .
and the problem , this is not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a zugangsproblem problem , so it can just be a zugangsproblem problem , which is a matter of a question , and how you can do that or how you can do better .
and it &apos;s got up with software , but there is also in the elektronikbereich , but there &apos;s also a whole bastlerszene that &apos;s going to do all sorts of abgefahrenen things .
now , in fact , towards biology , and i &apos;m going to take this metaphor , and i want to take this metaphor , and i want to take this metaphor , which is , you know , in biology , it &apos;s not just like computers , because it &apos;s dynamic because it &apos;s matter , so it &apos;s real matter , and not just cyber .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it , so you can also hacken it , so this is what i find is incredibly fascinating , and i think i just wanted to get a lot deeper with it .
it actually only zweitausend eight of the way that these networks , these networks .
there &apos;s hackteria dot org , which is originally from switzerland , which is in europe and with a cooperation in india , in india , but by now , and active people around the world .
this is a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and philosophers and in working with scientists with these technologies , and they &apos;re dealing with these technologies and process the creative , because there &apos;s museumsausstellungen and yes , all sorts of things .
but it &apos;s actually always about trying to find a lockeren access to you to find a playful deal with it .
and then there are do-it-yourself-bio dot , d.i.y.bio .
this is from the u.s.a network , which is actually a network , which is actually a kind of forum , where you are talking about and online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical , and also a little bit of businessmäßiger on the way , as well as well , you know , ja questions .
and based on these networks that have the whole popular thing , it &apos;s got to have a scene that i just want to porträtieren .
here &apos;s the picture on the left , you see biocurious , which is a hackerspace , which is basically a private school , a private school , non-profit institution , where everyone can get to .
children , old , all kinds of people are going out there to go through it , they set up a lab and look at what you can do when these laborprotokolle are .
and here on the left is a group in indonesia there &apos;s a group called house-of-natural-fibers , which is , but quite a long long time .
more than these other networks .
they also look at an artistic aspect of biological materials , and yes , also elektronikbasteleien , and combine it in quite abgefahre .
a group of ankara that i &apos;ve met a while ago , which is a while ago , that i &apos;ve met the public to give more , what they &apos;re learning about in college , and they &apos;ve been trying to explain so on straßenfesten , trying to explain what d.n.a is .
and i &apos;ve got a lecture up in copenhagen in the other picture in copenhagen the medical museum in copenhagen with an exhibition at the subject .
and this is , yes , it &apos;s usually quite a young young people , but the only thing that all united together is , is this fascination in technology .
and what you can do with it and look at a lot of the society , and ask in the way , okay , what do you want what you want , have you got an interest in order to bring you so ?
so , in order to hacken biology , you might have to have some material .
you need biological materials , of course , and you need tools , and it &apos;s also a laboratory .
or what you usually understand under a lab , these are sort of abgefahrene machines , extremely expensive , extremely distanziert , just for fachpersonal , trained academics with doktortitel and so on .
and our approach was to say , o.k , that actually don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary , because each of each other kaffeeautomat has actually got higher technology than most of the most laborgeräte , which is really like most .
and at the o with this premise premise , for example , brian degger , in england , for example , brian degger degger in england , he took a minimallabor , and then , yes , and , yeah , so suppenbrühe , and then it &apos;s grown into bacteria .
so anyone who &apos;s already a soup soup that he had for a long long time .
i &apos;ve tried to take this in my lab in my lab , a little bit of scale , and then put it on ebay and put a little bit of d.n.a on ebay and a little bit of d.n.a analysis , trying to do a vaterschaftstest , and so / fingerprinting , at home .
this is not supposed to be a joke at all right now .
here &apos;s what you see in the picture , you see , the laboratory , in anführungsstrichen , is a group of the lab , in anführungsstrichen , a group in paris , a group in paris in paris , and quite successful and pretty successful , and also quite interesting things , but i also want to anschneiden a project .
and this is biocurious , which is also hackerspace , which is , in fact , a kind of volkshochschule in the way of molecular biology .
and yeah , so you can see , it &apos;s relatively heterogen , so that &apos;s the people who are doing this alone , so far larger organizations , to big organizations , that have more formal in institutionalisierter form .
but always , always the way that it &apos;s going to be easy and to be accessible .
the first project that we made as an international group that we were made as a international group , when we were to be aware of our ourselves as a real scene now , and we are online , and we know the people who are always and more and more and so .
and then , from the do-it-yourself-bio org website of the founders , and he said , well , we also have to meet , and we also need to meet two events , and then we &apos;ve got two events , in london , in london , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco .
and then , that &apos;s what we want to say , well , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to say , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values and what are our values , what is our purpose of purpose ?
and then we &apos;ve got a code-of-conduct out of this .
this was quite intuitive , so everyone has just got his desires , and it &apos;s what &apos;s going on , and what &apos;s going on .
i think , i think , a very good code code code .
and then we &apos;ve got that .
and we &apos;ve been even trying to go back to the world &apos;s academic world , but it &apos;s not like that .
so , i think , from the biohackerszene , in terms , we &apos;re actually even a step further than the world &apos;s academic world .
well , what do we do for projects ?
a project i made with the hackteria-netzwerk in switzerland , in switzerland was that we wanted to make a so-called optical trap or optical .
that &apos;s when you focus a laser beam , in a room , you can capture your little particles in the air , or in the liquid and then moving into that focus , so that &apos;s then you captured there , like a traktorbeamstrahl principle .
it really works , this is going to work in academic setting , and we thought , o.k , we might have taken a webcam , and then we took a webcam , the aufgeschraubt , the lens , turned around , and then you have a microscope , you have a microscope .
this is what you see .
and then we have a d.v.d brenner und and then the laser brenner the laser , and then trying to focus on that camera .
and it didn &apos;t work out , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of this .
so another project that came from the french group in paris , which works out , it &apos;s pretty cool .
and that &apos;s what he &apos;s like , well , it &apos;s such a hirnwellenmessgerät , or something like this , so he has been engaged with neurobiologie , his nickname is sam neurohack .
and then he built this diesen helmet , and it &apos;s in cooperation in cooperation with the museum .
and then people could go in the room in the room , sit on this chair , put on this chair .
then their brainwaves brainwaves , and depending on what they thought , or how they thought , are then different lights in the space .
it was a pretty schickes project .
another thing from the united states , which is to do with this vaterschaftstestgeschichte , is that the p.c.r , which is the polymerase-kettenreaktion , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , vermehren , vermehren , fragments to reproduce , so you can make them visible .
so , if i do do this , the profiler at the scene at the scene of the crime scene , and then they &apos;re going to go into this way , and then they can say , o.k , and then they can say , o.k , this hair belongs to this person , like this .
and the machines that make something like this , they &apos;re pretty expensive to buy the billigsten , the cheapest are going on , the cheapest .
and that &apos;s not in the hobbybereich , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be a lot .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve been so two bastler and cheaper , and they said so two of them , and i said , you know , it &apos;s open source of open hardware , which is , you know , you know , this device , and you &apos;re now having this device , and you &apos;ve got to get the cheapest , and you know , the cheapest supply supply of these devices around the world .
i think it &apos;s kind of like that six dollars or something like that .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s in a framework where it gets clear .
so i think of this is a very gelungener hack .
a project that i started to do recently was build a gene-gun .
gene-gun is , yes , like a kind of luftdruckpistole , which schießt around like so far , two inches or something .
you invites d.n.a , and then you put it into this luftdruckpistole , and then i put it up on zwiebeln , and then i &apos;ve got them on zwiebeln , and then they &apos;ve been doing that .
so the device you see is that it doesn &apos;t work .
but this is so my prototype that prototype , but it &apos;s kind of abgefahren on a branch , the thing on this thing , the thing on it , and it was angeschlossen , and this was the pressure was too high , and this thing was broken .
and then i took a sahnespender and i took it on this .
a sahnespender , if you get the full of power with water , you have enough pressure , so i think , so 40 to sechtzig bar .
and then you can accelerate the particles too much enough , and then you go in onion .
and the commercial device costs about fünfzehntausend euros or something like the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically doable .
so , that &apos;s the moment that the kernanliegen of the scene is to increase the availability of technology and also the information and the verständlichkeit that more people can be engaged in there .
because , as i said the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have no idea of it , and also not a chance to make themselves really well .
because if you read about it , from sekundärliteratur , that &apos;s not the same thing as if you &apos;ve done it yourself or seen .
and i think technology becomes more important in our modern societies .
and if you can make a informierter citizen in a society in society , wants to make good choices in society , you need to know the access to knowledge and to technology .
and you have to do it , and understand it , and understanding it .
and then the firmiert is open knowledge and citizen science science .
so you know , you know , as citizens as citizens be able to be able to go through the scientific technologies .
and this is the kernanliegen of the biohackern .
these are the people who officially put themselves on the website , d.i.y.bio-dot-org website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also represented in southeast asia .
this is what i think is there are fewer people eingetragen than in fact .
so i know some who don &apos;t put themselves .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
and partly with these hackerspaces , these places put together .
and this is at the beginning .
as i said , zweitausendacht it only started .
and hackerspaces , so the computerhackerspaces , because the c-base in berlin was the first , neunzehnhundertfünfundneunzig .
and this is now a giant network of very good , yes , infrastrukturzentren has become represented throughout the world .
and we , of course , of course , we &apos;re similar to the spread , and then they &apos;re very well connected , so that no more people can get involved .
and i would invite everybody once , as well as well as well .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s also not impossible , if you have enough curiosity and enough energy , you get there .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hello .
how do we actually work ?
this is a question that has moved to me as a designer , but also in the area of the forschungsbereich and in front of all the things in the field .
it &apos;s about how you &apos;ve met people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media , and they &apos;re going to produce an extraordinary experience .
and i believe that the interactive media in us is archaische , cognitive models , so paradigm that in our biological memory very long , very long , very long time , and that we can just produce by interactive media .
and this is very amazing because you actually believe that these hochtechnologie that you &apos;ve seen is that they &apos;re going to get in the future , but in fact , the future is that the future is exactly with us , in our archaischen roots .
now , what are archaische models ?
and i wrote four stichworte , and i &apos;d like to explain briefly .
at archaischen cognitive models , the models are the models that we learned in the other time .
to the archaischen models of models that we &apos;ve got a natural relationship to virtuality .
this may basically sound unusual .
and i &apos;m going to go back to that , and i &apos;ll prove to you by trying to prove that you have a natural relationship to virtuality .
and the second thing is that we &apos;ve been able to talk about because of this archaischen models are very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very speaking , even though we &apos;re using a kodifizierte language today .
and the third area that explains itself .
we all know that the interactive media is about definition of definition , which includes the denial of linearität , and what of course , of course , is that we feel this is normal .
the fourth thing is that the story for us is a place for us .
now , what is that with the virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i want to give you that .
how many doors have the house where you live in ?
we won &apos;t be able to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen at the moment .
they go through the spirit of this house , in demn they live , and look how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
it virtualisieren the reality and it &apos;s without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and that &apos;s where we care for example , for example , for example , the virtual reality in our v.r.-labor , that we can actually do that all the time .
and this wealth that makes the virtual reality to virtualisieren the reality that people had to be needed at the other time , because they had nothing .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any fotolitografie .
they had no media media .
the only thing they had was their head .
and in that head , the memory .
in this head , knowledge abgerufen and with these virtual images , with imagination , had been passed on .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can deal with virtuality .
the interesting thing about this is when i can make a little trip .
yes , that &apos;s going .
the interesting thing about this is that at the time of the human being , at the same time and medium .
now , if you think a little bit further .
what are the media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s been a change .
but i &apos;ll get to it again .
the primary tool of informationsvermittlung has been stories for history .
schamanen , priests , so-called wissenswächter , were extra off to keep knowledge in stories .
and we &apos;re still hanging very , very strong in stories .
the author of the book of the book , jonathan gottschall , we &apos;re still verbingen a year with the rezeption of stories every year .
this means for a kid who has spent most of the most of the most of its life spent most of his life .
now we think our love depends on stories that we &apos;ve sat in the lap of our parents .
no , no , no .
that &apos;s a lot further back in the world &apos;s cultures .
but for me , in the field of interactive media as a particularly impressive , we have verankert in our biological memory , the ability to think nonlinear .
i brought you an example of the nordamerikanischen tribe tribe .
and the lives lived in the küstenregion of british columbia .
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very inselreiches area , and you had to be sort of able to navigate from an island from an island to get food .
and they did something called lead-landkarten .
you might be familiar with that , if you &apos;re a little bit interested in the australian government .
they have similar principles .
they have no lead-landkarten , but they used to be used as gennanten or traumpfade .
and what the interesting thing is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be mapped by songs .
in which the language of untergeordnetem was funded by untergeordnetem .
that means you &apos;re navigierte about sound and about rhythm .
and these sounds and these rhythm have shown geology , the topography of an area , and it has also enabled that you could put these songs and put this songs and go to the left on the left , to the right and back to the right .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to come from a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happened ?
it &apos;s so gennante machine age .
we have the so-called vogt-zeitalter .
it &apos;s the age age age age , and what happened is the book , and this is the book .
and that is exactly what happens that we have the responsibility for our memories and our individual memories of our individual memories have gone into external media .
in the book and on the book .
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god &apos;s play .
virtuality is suddenly alien to us , and it has nothing to do with reality .
so , bruce brown , a famous designforscher at the brighton-university , is so far to say that the book , he &apos;s going to say the book , and so on , and so on the internet , and so on what we call media media today that the mass mass of our memories have been fed and our ability to virtualisieren erudiert .
let &apos;s make a little zwischenbilanz .
from the vogt-zeitalter age machine .
what does influence on our thinking and on our erinnerungsvermögen ?
then the verblassenden einflüsse of the other cultures .
and they &apos;re going to be more überschrieben over the centuries of the centuries and more überschrieben through the einflüsse .
that , instead , instead , instead of us , instead of , we have to be far common , far common , in masses of memories that we can hang our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more ourselves .
we have a abstraktahierte language .
we don &apos;t think about the thing in pictures of the things that are more in pictures , but we kodifizieren them our language .
we &apos;ve been used to do things that things happen .
and we have the linearität as law , and there &apos;s just exceptions , like the non-linearität .
what &apos;s left is the storytelling .
still , we &apos;re still arrested , as a informationsvermittlung very , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
we had the vogt -zeitalter , we had this machine age machine , and we &apos;re going to go down this so-called cyber-zeitalter .
it sounds very spacig , and it sounds very , very nach , i know .
but these concepts of cyber-zeitalters that are bringing us back to discover these opportunities again .
it &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about non-linearität , it &apos;s about storytelling .
i just want to explain a little bit .
there are technical concepts like augmented reality , for example , which is the extended reality .
so if you look at google glasses , for example , it &apos;s such a concept of what makes us with the virtual world with the real world , which is called our affinität , which is virtual as something normal , it &apos;s natural , it &apos;s a natural natural natural .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
so , in the context of course , in the context of my talk , it may be because we &apos;re physically moving into existenten , virtual worlds , right after the holodecks .
and another example , another example are the ambienten , intelligent systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a person .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i graduated from the degree , and i hope that the video is a very , very , very , very nice project , which is the bachelorarbeit of michael burk , ann-kathrin krenz , joris klause and jan-moritz müller .
and the two letzteren are also here today .
maybe you can get up to get up , so you can pause the pause with those two over the time .
and i brought this project as an example of how i brought back to this archaischen , cognitive models .
the whole thing is a game that i have to say .
and , of course , , of course , of course , extrem and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i play computer games , you &apos;re very likely to see that any people in front of any konsolen herumhappeln , or they &apos;re playing with some of them in their hand .
anyway , they &apos;re doing this .
this is a game for the outside .
and that &apos;s specifically to be thought that i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , which is the data that we produce , which we produce , with the real world .
i apologize that i must be so strong .
you can then explain a lot better because there &apos;s more much more than that .
and that is that i discover a city by looking at which places positive or negative .
and so i get from the city a very different view of the city , very different ideas , which i see negative and positive zones of a city , and i get to this way , and that is a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
and that &apos;s what we like to look at now .
ah , what you can see here , excuse me , is a little bit of what you see .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls in our cities , it &apos;s clear .
and with a flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
and so , i would like to put my talk on my talk , and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the vogt , and we &apos;ve had a little bit like this , in the way that we &apos;ve had a little bit of cyber -zeitalters , and that we can be turned on this way about complex , technological , new products in the future , but we &apos;re going to get back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked if this bag is a sprechender bag , and i &apos;m going to talk .
it won &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m also going to resolve what &apos;s in there .
but i &apos;m just doing it , even curious about curious .
yes , children are from nature , or should be curious , designers too .
i &apos;m a creator of house , so i &apos;m going to work with the subject of , of course , and how changes our thinking also , and why are we going to lose curiosity , and it &apos;s going to be verlieren , again , again , again , anstoßen and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re dealing with the actual experience as a creator .
if professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to reingeschoben reingeschoben .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half a year .
a forschungssemester issue of natural user interface .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself why are you going to start with so natural , archaischen urformen of communication to address interaction and so on .
and i &apos;m just one of these little devices , because things are going to be more intuitive , and more and more natural , benutzungsfreundlicher , and you have to look at what is actually for us , of course , of course , of course , what &apos;s benutzungsfreundlich or intuitive .
and in front of the background , i &apos;ve got design in the realm of natural visual interface , so the next generation in terms of the human computer , in the relationship with the human computer , is how our tools or how the computer are changing from computers to the digital assistant .
so i &apos;ve been busy doing it , of course , or intuitive .
maybe you have to look at it again .
why does that happen ?
so , if we look at the development of our society , it &apos;s shown in short , then we &apos;re moving from the third in fourth the fourth gesellschaftsgeneration .
so from the modern in the computergesellschaft .
every society is shaped by a primärmedium .
at the beginning , the stammesgesellschaft of the language .
that means that you &apos;ve been talking to a common language , you could communicate with each other , you could communicate in the same cave , or in other areas , has städte or villages , and it &apos;s sort of creating nen stammesgesellschaft .
but the primärmedium was the language , something very natural , something very living .
in fact , you had to learn , so you can &apos;t be able to speak by nature , but we &apos;re learning about it , of course .
that was then abgelöst by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a riesen-aufschrei , because you of course , the living language started to manifestieren in the form , which is what &apos;s fluid and alive and alive , i start and get it into stone and meißele it .
depending on how i meißel and when i meißel , of course , it &apos;s a very different narrative than if there &apos;s a living way .
but then , sukzessive , then , was the script as a primärmedium .
and then the next generation we &apos;re primarily primarily in today .
this is the pressure of pressure and print writing with gutenberg and others .
it was as a affront where the adel , where adel and others have said , you know , you know , wahnsinnig , when the people want to read , then you want to get your people , and that , of course , is completely fatal .
and now we get into the next generation and the exciting thing is , so it &apos;s just every few hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this phänomenalen stage that we &apos;re sort of something .
that confused us , of course , because we &apos;re looking at one side the new media , socil social media , facebook and so on .
and with total transparency transparency , what the new thinking is what the new thinking is , you don &apos;t say that in lasagne and no beef beef beef is more or other phenomena , which is what i just want to do , and i want to kundtun that .
and these two worlds just pop together , new and old thinking .
and the exciting thing is , when you look at this , this new society , these computergesellschaft , are very many mechanisms , principles , principles and archaischer paradigm from the stammesgesellschaft .
now , not at the local level , but in global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
the subject is an ecology of ecology .
not when i think the local green , and the neighbor is less organic , the whole thing doesn &apos;t work .
that &apos;s , from the local village , in fact , a global village has become the same with the same principles , of course , very intuitive , but also the total transparency .
as you knew in the village then , who &apos;s got what happens to whom and when this is happening , this is what happens today of our self , of these mobile mobile mobile endgeräte on global level .
it &apos;s that we know globally and faster and faster and better .
that &apos;s what it happened to the village .
in front of the background , i just have to look at what it is , what is , of course , of course , what we have , what we might have verlernt , what we might have , what &apos;s instinctively for us , so what makes the difference ?
because there are people who are people , you can &apos;t do it , so everyone can deal with it .
so you have to look at what it means , because it &apos;s not just changing it , it &apos;s different , it &apos;s going to be better .
and then , of course , , of course , it &apos;s intuitive and how , of course , as a creator , i can take influence and make the things like this , you know , you &apos;re really intuitive , because then you make fun , and you &apos;re just to use it .
and then you &apos;re dealing with , as well as a graduate student , with the subject of perception and the wahrnehmungspsychologie .
and , of course , that is , of course , where you start and watch , okay , okay , okay , now , i just look at the inner self .
and what is it looks like there ?
so how do we work when we reingucken ?
and what is , of course , of course , of course , intuitive intuitive and how does our channels work of perception and how does the cognitive processing ?
because steve jobs has said , you know , need to dig deeper to understand how .
so you really have to look at the details , if i want to make something benutzungsfreundlich or intuitive , what &apos;s called the core .
and you see , you know , you know , you can see our seven senses , in which we think , in fact , it &apos;s been seven , it &apos;s probably seven , the next future , in the near future , you know , it &apos;s an extension , and it &apos;s an extension of an extension .
and look , how do we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many use the word , you know , you don &apos;t know what it means .
but i have to understand at the heart of understanding in the essence , when it &apos;s going to information , when information becomes information and from information , and from information , so that i know , i know , i know , things could be intuitive , of course , or of course .
and of course , what design is about perception .
and we see this when i do things , when i do things , i can make you gestalten like on the right , where i don &apos;t know what is salt salt and pepper , or i can make it kind of intuitive by showing things .
so , very much natural , which is in a head , but i look at right , right now , where salt salt and pepper .
and when i say to someone , give me salt or pepper , then he &apos;s going to think of the right , where is what &apos;s inside .
and so , in the left , i hope that there &apos;s no sugar in the left , and then i think that there &apos;s no sugar .
but also our perception itself , how does it make us .
for example , this perception in the context .
the right circle looks bigger than the little , even though that &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s the same big , and yet , our perception , depending on the context of the context .
anybody know what that is ?
come on .
pattern recognition should work .
there &apos;s going to be some of my glasses .
so it &apos;s an n circle .
a second circle starts to get some resemblance or associate .
and if i keep a halboval dazusetze , then we don &apos;t see one of them , which is , a circle , circle , circle , but we see one unit , we don &apos;t see more three parts , a circle , a circle , another .
it &apos;s called gestaltgesetz or a little bit called gestaltpsychologie that &apos;s also influenced us in perception .
it &apos;s important for designers who have the first semester in the first semester , the great gestaltgesetze .
gestaltgesetz of the continuity of the continuity and so on .
it &apos;s often forgotten again .
but this is an essential part , if you want to be able to make things very specific .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , very interesting .
it sounds very banal , but it &apos;s really exciting when you &apos;re getting closer .
so we have the eyes forward , and now think of it , we &apos;re looking at from the beginning .
that &apos;s wrong .
first of all , you see from the back .
because it &apos;s an assumption that you see , you can see something you can see , beispielweise circle .
that means we &apos;re just going to see it , before we see it , back to the back in our seheapparat , to say , okay .
i &apos;ve got such cognitive cognitive rückkoppelung , you have what you want to see .
that &apos;s then , again , it &apos;s going back .
then it goes forward , because the back of the back in the front of the front , and says , look , look at look at look at the time , and you &apos;ll see if what you see , that &apos;s also what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s going to be seen .
so this is a very , very spannender process , like certain things that happen and what &apos;s going on in what these things happen .
i don &apos;t know who you know this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i just described .
now everyone from this pattern is trying to see something .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
does anybody see something particular ?
a dalmatiner , right .
once i &apos;ve seen that there &apos;s a dalmatiner in there , you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget about it because i &apos;ll show you where the dalmatiner is .
now you see the dalmatiner .
and further , you &apos;re always seeing it .
so , i &apos;ve actually verdorben them that they don &apos;t recognize any pattern , but i &apos;ve got them back in a very short time , again , to see this dog in this verworrenen picture .
and this is this projection of vision , rückkopplung , see .
now i know it and now i &apos;m going to start to the front that i see the dalmatiner .
i see the dalmatiner .
so very , very exciting processes that then , in this , yes , gray is actually not , but there &apos;s a lot of the mass in that rosanen mass .
does anyone know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
if i know something takes three seconds of seconds , until i go from the present to the vergangenheitsschleife , then i can also bridge very well in which i &apos;m going to make him just by three seconds .
it has to process it as a present .
then it goes into the past , and so i can bridge very elegant wartezeiten , for example , for example , when i know that phenomenon .
what takes fünfundzwanzig milliseconds milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the period you &apos;re in love .
that means you know , if you know who you see , who you look at who you &apos;re looking at as long because i don &apos;t take a gewähr for what can happen .
and sechzehn milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time of most perceptions we have .
that is , this first impression , in a rapid fast speed , how we perceive things .
and as we can see things also , what we &apos;re looking at and how we protect ourselves against our environment , so we can think about it .
of course , designers don &apos;t just look at the issue with the subject of perceptions and neural verarbeitungen , but mostly , of course , of course , of course , of course , with the subject of mensch-objekt-beziehung .
so , like a human being with certain things .
so there &apos;s some practical functions that are produktsprachlich the practical functions , so there &apos;s such formale things or formalästhetische things .
there &apos;s anzeichen-funktionen where i know exactly where i don &apos;t have to reach .
but there are also symbolic functions , why does somebody have a little täschchen for such a little täschchen , where they don &apos;t have a little täschchen money on money , even though it &apos;s not so practical ?
there we &apos;re more on the symbolischen , on the bedeutungsebene , with which we are , of course , as a designers .
back to my real issue of natural user interface and the theme , of course , is usability .
usability always means how i can do a certain goal , or how can a user be effective in a certain sense of being effective , efficient and zufriedenstellend .
that &apos;s how it &apos;s about the norm .
how do i make something more possible ?
i can use that directly or i need an n i need , or i need a entsprechende manual , and i need to do that i need to do it .
and less usable or benutzungsfreundlich is .
that i &apos;m just doing that , and make fun , doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s better handhabbar .
you have to understand .
and then , if you look at the software that we &apos;ve seen , then you &apos;re going to see why neunundneunzig percent of our today &apos;s software , or not to be anhieb , which is i-pad in many areas or i-phone in many areas , even though it &apos;s already more intuitive than classical software .
and i didn &apos;t have an intuitive benutzbarkeit for apple &apos;s been a fundamental wirtschaftsfaktor , nen , nen , nen of fundamental erfolgsfaktor , if i just want to harness technology .
why ?
because we &apos;re using these new kind of nutzbarkeit , so that the natural user ínterfaces , for example , for example , are five times more than at our goal .
you have to imagine that if you &apos;re doing something the classic softrware , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software just an hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you can probably go home four hours , but your company , or you know , you know , it &apos;s going to be looking at the four hours .
but i want to say that , of course , of course , for us , of course , of course , it &apos;s a brain system , and also some things .
so , if we go back into software , there &apos;s the first command line that were very abstract , which was very abstract , where you took months to deal with these systems .
and then the next that came up with &quot; nem neural model or mental model like the software , &quot; you &apos;ve been working , you know , you have an idea of something called the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to harness the computer .
so no longer zeros and ones or kryptische code , but a metaphor .
it made a lot of benutzungsfreundlicher , but it &apos;s still a lot better .
the next generation of the graphischen works very much more with behavior .
so , i &apos;m making a lot of a lot more , a lot more often than that .
this is also a paradigm shift .
in fact , i think that this is going to be unwichtiger for success , just the usability is going to be an app .
and when i get a step into this natural user interfaces , where i , by a voice , by a voice , by having language , by touch , by the gesture , and no longer with mouse mouse and cursor , i &apos;m still faster and still hand .
but that also leads me to the point , when are things going to be more intuitive ?
if you get more intuitive , and then i have to go back to my little friend here , and look at , what does this mean in terms of view of view , when is really something intuitive ?
and this is , for us humans , is always intuitive , if i have to think little about this .
so he didn &apos;t want to think of the way he would like to think about it .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
that means that if we look at existing handlungsmodelle from one to something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can use it as a creator .
that means that i can just put an intuitive , human handlungsmodell , and put the software into software and make the software a lot of benutzungsfreundlicher .
so , of course , what &apos;s the question of what &apos;s actually the intuitivste handlungsschema of us people and now i have .
this is called osit-modell .
that &apos;s using each of us and osit is an acronym , and it stands for orientieren , selektieren , informieren , transagieren .
that &apos;s all of you all of the time , but it &apos;s doing it , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive , or partly instinctively .
the model is already ausprägt in the womb , and it &apos;s interkulturell , so it works in a young world &apos;s and old , and it &apos;s being used by all the time , without knowing that most of us knew that this model is there .
osit osit is going to be about 50 to the activity of activity , so you have noticed that it &apos;s less often strapaziert than a day .
so , i can see now this mental handlungsmodell , orientieren , informieren , informieren , übertragen on a interaktionssystem .
and by this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of desktops , now , not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a handlungsmusters , a handlungsprinzips .
and this is on a higher grail of benutzungsfreundlichkeit than the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the desktops .
and now , for instance , for example , for example , i &apos;m going to look at &apos; , for example , for example , where i &apos;m going to look at it in the details , and i mean , in fact , i can send it somewhere somewhere or shop or shop , and so on .
and then i can transmit the whole .
i &apos;m trying to go through a beispiels .
well , everybody has eaten cake .
in particular : now , i interact with the object , i interact with the object , it can be rauszoomen .
i &apos;ll get the whole track of all this , now filters this , and say , just show me all of the thing about chocolate .
and once i have an interface , which is much more intuitive and very much more natural .
because that i can reach things like the bits , and you can get to me , it can be much more natural than hierarchisch organized organized websites or other mechanisms that can make these things available .
imagination is more important than , and with this phrase , i &apos;d like to end up with a clue , also , designers , designers need to think , as well as designers to come to new solutions , and in that sense , i thank you very much for your attention and please .
i want to give you a very particular aspect of curiosity .
and the first thing you &apos;re going to do is , when you &apos;re a kid , you &apos;re going to take care of what you have a child , right ? and depending on whether your parents allowed you to play more or less in the töpfchen and play , the more , you will , of course , you start with curiosity .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
these are all the ones who are here and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m now about , virtually all this umweltdiskussion , weltuntergang , 40 years of club-of-rome , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point .
and it depends on phosphorus .
give pee a chance .
every day , they &apos;re giving up on order of order about two grams of phosphorus , and every day they have to pick up two gram .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have a bone .
we could just glide as amorphe mollusken through the weltmeere .
if we didn &apos;t have phosphorus , in fact .
astonishingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re looking at something here with something that was actually selbstverständlichkeit , but it &apos;s not that way .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody talks about the phosphor-problem .
the phosphor-problem is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only got phosphorus for two years , and now it &apos;s going to be a lot more uranium in the environment than it &apos;s used in all atomanlagen .
in the last twenty years , fünfzehntausend tons of uranium had been distributed in our fields .
and that &apos;s what we take .
it &apos;s doing leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so for example , schütz the environment , fahr the environment .
the environment , make less waste .
the environment , verbrauche less energy .
but it &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s how if i say , schütz your child , it schlag only three times rather than five times .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
when we think from the wiege to the bahre , our entire earth is going to be or later a friedhof .
that &apos;s about how to think about the wiege .
and the most important thing about this is to look at the ground as the first thing .
in the ground , over sechzig percent of kohlenstoffs .
now , at the moment we &apos;re building corn and 30 kilograms of 30 pounds per hectare or 30 pounds of meters .
that means we &apos;re losing about five thousand times more than new fünftausend .
so , of course , we can look at the müllproblem .
and everything is yes or content .
for example , in offenbach , 20 percent of the müllmenge is windeln .
and because we get older , it &apos;s going to be bigger .
they &apos;re all in the vorwindelphase .
yes ?
a baby takes about six windeln .
so , of course , we could reduce that about 10 percent , but what does it do ?
this is ausgeglichen in china in a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we do with these windeln ?
this is one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus will be emitted in the pigs .
people across the urine .
yes .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s demonstrated , right ?
traditionally , we think in umweltdiskussion , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you get people to exist , when you say that , if you say , it would be better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you &apos;re going to be raffgierig and hostile .
and somebody like al gore gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing wichtigeres than the human population .
in israel you know , when you get a human beings , you get the earth .
here it says , the more you umbringst , the better you do .
yes .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about four times more than we humans .
i could take termites for termites , but in the united states , nobody in the united states , even though , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh much more than us .
and because they &apos;re physically working much harder than we and because they &apos;re just three to six months , they are in their weight in their weight , in the energy use 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and as you can see how far we &apos;re going to do , and what we could do , and what we could do , and what we could do , and we can see that we can see , for example , for example , for example , it has a program , for example , have a program , for example , in fact , you can be here , for example , right ?
you can only be klimaneutral if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only opportunity .
have you seen a klimaneutralen tree before ?
yes ?
one single ?
that means that our intelligence means we want to be dumber as a trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is kohlenstoffneutral .
happiness , yes ?
there &apos;s no überbevölkerungsproblem on trees .
there &apos;s still six billion trees alone in the amazonasgebiet .
you &apos;ve heard a little bit about trees before ?
that means all of our intelligence means we &apos;re going to be dumber than trees .
and where you see , even in a little bit , you know , you know , the strikteste bio- of agriculture doesn &apos;t allow you to go back .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back together .
and we are too many .
on it alone .
this is what we feel guilty about the earth that we say . there &apos;s no bio-landbau , no bioland , no nature-et-progrès , and how they all say that will allow our own exkremente .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
it &apos;s too many .
it makes sense to be less harmful , to be less harmful .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about minimize a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , is the highest to be there , right ?
nullemissionen , yes ?
you can only have nullemissionen if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot yourself , you would have emissions .
so they can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can get our nutrients back .
we do in brazil in brazil in where we get the nutrients back .
right , we can look at this way in agriculture in agriculture .
we do this in china for example , for example , where we take the trash .
in china , a nachttopf is still honigtöpfchen today , right ?
and in our western world , we always were too dumb , our nutrients .
it &apos;s called the whole western zivilisationsgeschichte of the city , that the city has only been , but has never returned to farmers .
and it had to grow the cities , because the farmers went into the cities and the cities always had to move away their nutrients .
all of the western rich rich are increasingly expanding until they didn &apos;t get the infrastructure and then they &apos;re implodiert .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done bruchlos civilization over five thousand years , because you were always able to get the nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat , you &apos;re expected to be the food in china , you &apos;re expected to be , until you &apos;re going to see the toilet .
because it &apos;s unfreundlich to go and take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve got them invited to eat , not to the nährstoffdiebstahl .
that means you can see on the internet , how to get the nutrients back .
this is actually , if you do this is , when you do that , if you do that , agriculture does , you , in the country in favelas , in favelas in favelas , you can make a farmer about eintausendfünfhundert dollars , and the plant are waiting for that , chickens and schwein and duck and vegetables and the fish .
and the great thing about this is that the verbrechensrate in the favelas , about women .
so we don &apos;t have to control the people who are very little bad .
we can support them to be good .
this is , of course , high-tech-landwirtschaft , but the facilities are wearing themselves .
the byproduct oil is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by the design that a farmer can make you easily manage .
and that means that &apos;s going back to go back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve been built now over hundertfünzig over the last twenty years , none of these facilities have ever been sabotiert .
they could easily be ruined a liter of altöl , and then it would be ruined for years .
it doesn &apos;t happen .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people who are very little bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to zurückkriegen phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you &apos;re writing yourself in germany , in germany , the best treatment of the treatment is in frankfurt .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not in offenbach , but maybe you can help the frankfurtern a little bit .
because the frankfurter plant could best back the phosphorus .
and it has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s true .
we &apos;re used in the netherlands now over three years .
the dutch government has explains , they &apos;re going to be the first country in the world what phosphorus is .
but we need this overall .
you understand , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the phosphorvorkommen worldwide .
there &apos;s a bunch of waisenknaben opec .
these are sechsundzwanzig countries that control 40 percent of the ölvorräte .
and the oil is we can replace by other energieträger .
but you can &apos;t replace phosphorus .
it &apos;s not about making the existing to make the existing a little less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and in particular , first of all , to ask what is the right thing .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in the netherlands of course , you understand this is easier because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if you &apos;re sad for example , for example , your wife is sad , if you &apos;ve got it , and you get to 50 rosen .
totally inefficient .
but it &apos;s really effective , yes ?
or take a lippenstift .
a woman in germany is eating about six kilograms three kilograms of her life .
there .
that &apos;s not exactly correct , because we don &apos;t know how much weggeküsst is there .
but a lippenstift , even at this lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but it &apos;s really effective , right ?
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
it &apos;s not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
what &apos;s the right thing ?
not to burn a little bit more a little bit better than to burn it and have the whole materials to lose the whole materials , but first of all , you know , how do you schließt ?
imagine mozart for mozart .
yes ?
when i put them up to dinner and say yes , there &apos;s a pill with offenbach-geschmack and a glass of water .
wonderful , huh ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything that counts in life is it &apos;s not to save .
all the umweltdiskussion .
we say to people , oh yes , you don &apos;t have green green .
no , it &apos;s just just the right ?
in every place , where you &apos;re wegwirft , of course , you create lebensmöglichkeiten .
but the wrong things .
if you wegwirft the wrong things , you have a müllproblem .
as we think about north .
there &apos;s any footprint there .
when you walk , yes , everyone footprint the ground .
because the bottom of the ground , the mosses are dying and the wind and the water is washing the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water remains in the meadow meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that is going to be a feuchtgebiet .
not schuldmanagement .
we say in germany .
yes ?
but when i ask her , how about your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , herzliches beileid , yes ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so we are not saving .
every waste is nährstoff .
and it &apos;s a lust , when you see in italy , as the people in the high bow , it &apos;s out of the car , it &apos;s probably kick out of the car that .
because you know , this is a lustvoller process .
it &apos;s a form of revierverhalten , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the real design , please .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a eiscremeverpackung , which is at the temperature .
they can go to where they go and stand .
it &apos;s two hours in two hours .
and it contains seeds of these rare plants , so they &apos;re going to contribute to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so it &apos;s two together .
it &apos;s not all to be kompostierbar .
a television machine , or a washing machine , they just don &apos;t use them .
just the things , the verschleißen , like schuhsolen , like bremsbeläge , like autoreifen , they need to be that in biological systems .
the things that are only used , go to technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
so , very direct advertising , not for the company &apos;s firma , but that you now help this company to make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t do things more freely .
yes ?
so , if i go to the food and say , this is free from hähnchen , then it doesn &apos;t help you .
no , we &apos;re stuck what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like detox .
not toxic inside .
but everything that &apos;s inside is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can go to the kavalierstart at the fußgängerampel and gummi in biological sites , right ?
everything is kompostierbar of it .
and if we do , of course , of course , you know , of course , to nike , for nike , for nike and mauritz and the whole textile industry .
and this is half of all the abwasserprobleme worldwide that are caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re going to help with questions for people .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
because they already changed twice the vorstandsvorsitzenden .
and i &apos;m not so sure they &apos;re really dabeibleiben .
so , help me a little bit .
but it &apos;s going .
yes .
that &apos;s just been shown .
that &apos;s going .
so we can do things now that if you &apos;re verschleißen , if you kaputtgehen , you can in biological cycles .
it &apos;s the same together .
there &apos;s a direct rücknamesystem for this .
this is the first green backpack , actually , it &apos;s made to go back in the cycle .
so , again , in every store , in every store .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the windel ?
now , at the moment , the trash is .
all over these windeln , virtually .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s at the time on the deponien , but in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastic , so that it can go in biological systems , if we change the wasserspeicher , inside that you can just go back to zellulosebasis , you can , with a baby in israel , or in tunisia , hundertfünfzig trees .
yes ?
if you take these windel , you &apos;re zerkleinern , you know , you know , you know , you know the powder , and the powder to plant trees .
so the baby is kohlenstoffpositiv for all life , from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be klimaneutral , we can be klimapositiv .
it &apos;s sort of a beneficial poop print .
yeah , sort of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything else .
i created a institute .
and there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can all be engaged .
there &apos;s extra a group to make cradle-to-cradle-verein , where everyone can join .
so you can &apos;t save anymore , avoid , avoid reduce , no schuldmanagement , it &apos;s intelligent waste .
do you make that curious ?
thank you .
the work of interpreten .
music as a language .
in the description of my talk to my speech is written that i was as a interpretin , as a übersetzerin , as a übersetzerin , i understand .
interpreten are the written notes of the written notes in klingende music .
that you &apos;re not just sending a word for the text for the text in another language , but also the deeper sense of the words and wortzusammenhang , so that it has to make a good translation , anyone who has to do it with fremdsprachen .
to translate from the germans to english , more knowledge , if you don &apos;t require , if you &apos;re about poetry , it &apos;s about poetry .
so alien , it &apos;s fremd , but what we were doing with our musiksprache .
as a interpretin , i just have the written notes .
you think that the composer was all hineingeschrieben in the notes in the notes , what he has imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and ungenau .
these notes are about the same , or ungenau , as a verbal mind , if it &apos;s a very seemingly scheinbar , the description of a landscape .
because in this verbalen landschaftsbeschreibung , the smell of flowers is not to smell the level of the grüns , just to erahnen the säuseln of the windes to don &apos;t feel .
this is , the interpreter needs to be on the center of the notensprache on another , which is hörbare , in a different concrete , concrete , nonverbale .
so today , i want to tell you what i &apos;d like to say , well , in a verbal language , even in a verbal language .
so basically a translation of the translation .
and so i prefer to do it all the way to german , because if i had to translate it even once once in english , it would be equivalent to me in the translation of the translation .
so the music works for me as much as spoken spoken language .
the notierten notes is the function of the letters of a writing .
so it &apos;s not going to do just reading grades , and to push on the piano on the piano or the right place on the piano .
that &apos;s just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the meaning of the letters you can &apos;t see if you can do the language .
and so for the learning process of music , it takes at least as long as the spoken language .
so there &apos;s also abstufungen , whether you learn it for the hausgebrauch , is only passive understands , or you can also speak to the musical speaker .
the work of the interpreten starts like a theaterregisseurs .
after first of all , we chose to play a piece , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re looking at the formation of the emergence of the composition .
you collect information about the piece in the sekundärliteratur .
you read into the letters , tagebüchern , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of a composer .
you studied the work that he &apos;d written before and after .
you hire them .
the beweggründe to write it .
how and what he &apos;d love ?
how were its circumstances , like society and politics ?
it &apos;s all interested in me .
you think in this time , you know , for example , liest images or literature .
but with the time , you &apos;ve also got a knowledge of the world as an interpreter , and the composers that you know , and it &apos;s easier to play , and it &apos;s easier to feel in it .
the composer is always going to be more to the friend who you live together .
his concern to write the piece , becomes more and more and more to my personal concern to play .
now , there &apos;s the notes the notes everything else as a function of the composer , but only a framework framework , i &apos;m now going to turn this framework to make sense of meaning and meaning .
i &apos;ll say to my own words , which could be written between this framework .
i play erklärend , which could have these notes .
now for me and for the composers , and what they might mean for him now .
every note , every phrase gets a sense , because i feel it myself because it comes from my personal gelebten .
it &apos;s got to me in here and now , if i can &apos;t tell my audiences , i can &apos;t convince my audience that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been able to see so long in advance how to neu .
how you experienced a happy new day , even though with the same rituals of life , stand up , eat , have breakfast , you get to work , as well as the same piece , and again , the same piece .
i &apos;ve become a day older a day older , the seasons , my pulse goes down in the morning , in a konzertsaal , it takes a little longer that sound comes back as home .
i &apos;ll take the audience true , or unconsciously .
all of that affects me , and all of that affects my experience with the composition .
it &apos;s quite a wonderful thing , if i &apos;m standing on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing is like in a good conversation .
you get a new idea in it , and it &apos;s based on this answer with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we don &apos;t have geprobt , and what you can &apos;t do .
it &apos;s great fun to make this kind of music , and you know , as the audience , it communicates how the music communicates alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i will never play more like this moment .
i can &apos;t play as in 20 years today .
and i &apos;m going to have more lebenserfahrung than today than today and i &apos;m going to have a lot more to my palette on my palette , so much more emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some farbtöpfe rausgeschmissen , but i &apos;m going to have new dazubekommen .
i have a nice concrete example .
it was on a klavierkursus for my beloved old teacher , professor jürgen ude , a known beethoven-spezialist , konzertpianist , langjähriger professor of musikhochschule here in stuttgart .
unfortunately , i was much too young , so that he was emeritiert when i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune , very early , with 13 years , and so i was to meet in my school classes .
i was 17 when i went back to one of his courses , and played the last one of the four balladen of the chopin , a spätwerk .
he asked me what was the introduction of this ballade for me .
this is a getragenes part .
and in my jugendlichkeit , i said , expectation .
and he said , and he said that ?
this has to be altersunterschied .
because for me , it means memory .
he was already over sechzig .
well , with 17 , you have dreams , but there &apos;s no significant memories .
i play the piece of games today , and it has gone back to me now , although not a single note has changed .
every time , it &apos;s exciting , because again , i &apos;ll read something new .
an example from a very different area . monet has made the seerosen x-mal .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different tageszeit , in verschiedenem light .
he &apos;s translated the seerosen verschiedentlich , as he saw it , like she looks at it in this moment .
his personal impressionen of seerosen .
the x-malige interpretation of a piece is comparable .
and i &apos;m also older than chopin , when he was , when he wrote the piece .
he was just neununddreißig years .
and it &apos;s important to me to look at the notes , even though i mean , you know , it .
to keep zwiesprache , right with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially if it &apos;s died .
now , how do you start talking to the language of music ?
and i said , you know , you need about as long as the spoken language .
a lot of times , the musikunterricht is that you learn to read the notes .
you &apos;re learning for virtually first first , before you &apos;re just going to speak a word .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
if all of the fingers are moving on time and right , as it turns out in the notes , it turns out to sound that sound like music .
if that &apos;s happening , the students get the nächstschwierige piece .
you can barely talk about interpretation .
all right , at the front , it &apos;s presto , that &apos;s a quick piece .
lento , slow .
loud and b , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s what most of you know .
but also , if you put it on it , it &apos;s still just something technical .
and it &apos;s always an interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you &apos;re often perfectly elementares .
and that is that to make music on the instrument that will do their musical musical and feel before .
that &apos;s the singing .
a kid who didn &apos;t have learned this because the parents don &apos;t have vorgemacht , it won &apos;t be done by themselves .
this is like sprechenlernen .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music to get it over one more way to be able to sound about an instrument .
people who &apos;ve never been singing , they didn &apos;t feel that immediately felt with their own body , as it is to form a tone .
to make a phrase with its own breath .
because the music instrument is the extension of our body .
our vocal voice to the singing , our hands and feet .
that &apos;s how the sequel is the sequel of my fingers .
the tune comes from the gesungenen and the rhythm of the dance .
the dauernde berieselung today with music is not förderlich .
you don &apos;t need to make any more music if it &apos;s going to be bored .
no more necessary to whistle or singing .
every human music is going to be plattgemacht when you get away from the outside music .
sure , there are some of you who say , yeah , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
i &apos;m going to ask you , can you sing , a , because you believe you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because you didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
in both of course , it &apos;s not too late to see if you can &apos;t do it , or learn how to do these little muscles , you use the stimmbänder , right .
that &apos;s what you can do .
or c , because you have bescheinigt them , they &apos;re untauglich .
and i wonder how fachlich was this diagnosis ?
did you have a zweit- or drittmeinung , how do you say beautiful today ?
or d , they don &apos;t like music , and they don &apos;t like to have a shame .
and then what i was going to do , because music is a beautiful , kommunikative thing .
but maybe you can also be umstimmen .
well , you can see , all of the time , nobody has to be a aussichtsloser candidate .
but don &apos;t tell me , i don &apos;t understand anything about the classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i say , well , you can tell you whether you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it tells anyone , i don &apos;t know if it tastes me , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , you don &apos;t get rid of the food , just because you can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to get rid for classical music , because you don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to you and say , if it tastes them or not .
whether the music is to gepfeffert or sweet .
tell what you feel .
at the time , you also get standards standards , and you want to do something more spices or taste , or taste .
why am i asking from my audience now that it &apos;s going to be active ?
because the music is a language , and it &apos;s a language to communicate .
a piece of artwork you never look at has no force .
the food that was gekocht from a chef or a chef liebevoll has to be eaten and not just looked at recipes .
so please listen to when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice thing .
if in an environment where the adults are doing music or at least aktiv music , a child grows up , it &apos;s quite easy to be a musiklehrer , asking , what color has your flower ?
can you actually play them in blue ?
and the child is playing , after a gedenkpause , instead of a red , a red flower .
and this sounds different than before .
so this was the first very first beginning of a musical expression .
so the first step toward an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece of a piece today , that was originally a hundred years ago , or zweihundert years ago ?
now the instruments have fortentwickelt .
there was no instrument at the time as an instrument .
it wasn &apos;t invented yet .
i think that bach would have been excited if he had the klanglichen possibilities of the modern klaviere .
i can see the klangvorstellungen that bach had had to be on the modern wing , which is not a barockes cembalo .
even from beethoven , you know he heard more when he was deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that &apos;s an orchestra orchestra .
that &apos;s why composers depend on us interpreten the pieces of the pieces .
so they get up to what they &apos;ve only imagined in the mind .
and what she would think in the mind today .
or what i &apos;m going to do today , because what you might have thought .
thank you .
do you know what envy is ?
were you neidisch ?
and how did it feel ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
so when i come up with my little v w piesel , and i put me next , this feeling .
i &apos;ll shoot something through the head .
i say , ulf , what do you need so big car ?
that &apos;s the first year in the first year .
and anyway , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to do so , so why do i have a little car ?
and then it falls to me immediately , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and how i say the word of justice is this awkward sensation .
our organism invented a great method to get the inconvenient feelings like envy simply to disappear .
you can try this with words like revenge or gewinnsucht or something .
so i want to tell you something about this mechanism today or a näherbringen , which is probably likely to be familiar with you .
the mechanism is from the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you might have heard , when people say , nobody has a wall to build wall .
and then steine rocks , so he versperrt them .
in such a lie , you see the liars themselves don &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to check out that he &apos;s got very different in mind .
he just makes it , and it &apos;s not itself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about is that they &apos;re täuschen themselves .
you need this lie to get a lebenslüge to get a selbsttäuschung selbsttäuschung .
they can get less easy , yes , nachprüfen or whatever .
they need time .
from that time , one anecdote that you might know .
the spanish pablo picasso once has a woman .
this woman &apos;s beschwert , the portrait wouldn &apos;t see her at all .
picasso says , just wait .
it will always be similar .
at this point and if you &apos;re laughing , you know how important this lie is and how much time you need to learn something that artists can tell us .
because artists have a gestörtes ratio to lie .
the artist gives you something with it , and most of the lady that you don &apos;t see if you look at it in the mirror .
the artist gives you a little bit about what you &apos;re going to be familiar with when you look at this piece of artwork .
then this awkward feeling disappears , it could not look similar to you , and it will always be similar to you .
here you have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to the stabilisierung of our lebensverhältnisse .
and not only in art , in the volksmärchen , in the mythology , in the mythology , it comes back up .
you might know this idea of the lady who looked at the mirror every morning and asked him , who is the most beautiful over the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a schönere .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true world tells you , the mirror can &apos;t lie from that true world &apos;s .
but we &apos;re just going to make sure that you can &apos;t tell a woman to say that there &apos;s a schönere somewhere else .
here &apos;s what we need to understand what we &apos;re using under politically correctness , and again .
we need this lie that this lie that makes us deception without yet to still survive .
we don &apos;t just have the arts in the volksmärchendichtung , but in science , in science , but in science , in science .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s bischofs .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the emergence of the species and the spread of the people .
that the human being should be abstammen , and yes , at least a common ancestor there were between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her to her husband and said , this is not true , which charles writes .
man is supposed to have abstammen or a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to prevent people to know about it .
why do we prevent people to know about something when it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live without these lebenslüge .
because what we &apos;re doing is because we see , from the top of the highest beings , not from such a naturebene , from such a naturebene , like an organism , like this , like this , like this , like , you know , for us , it is for us .
so , we can &apos;t bear with these things .
we need to prevent the people know about things , especially when they are true .
so , you can see how slowly this mechanism out of this mechanism and like the traces that are leaving , which is leaving , in something else , in the great picture of us , i want to näherbringen you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , like i mean .
my wife told her me .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told a student .
a autistischer student .
she likes to do it , because he &apos;s got a tendency to each other .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire fire .
and because i &apos;m at the fire , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnische things .
yeah , you feel it , if you &apos;re heiter at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , whenever a person in a moral place , it &apos;s used , we should try to replace it through the wörtchen .
do it once , and then you learn the sentence .
although i &apos;m at the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnische things .
you feel , that &apos;s the real truth behind us .
it &apos;s a little bub that doesn &apos;t care about feuerlöschen .
it &apos;s interested in feuermachen .
but there are no vereine clubs where we can see where you learn how to do fire .
it &apos;s just the second second , the fire fire .
he was signed up .
and überdies , you don &apos;t say that you &apos;d like you like to put out fires somewhere , and you &apos;re happy when the fire was hochlodert .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we are in charge of getting the risks to remove the risks that others do if they just put fire fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
now , this is that the innersten of the bub knew that he knew that he &apos;s related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say it loud .
so here they have this zensor between unconscious unconscious and the conscious thing that immediately anspringt , without doing something about it , and the things that they know that they look very differently , designed that they can be much better for them and sound .
and then just the words that we &apos;re using in the language of the politically correct sprechens .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know when we tell that , the social story is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do these things in a society that should work .
so i &apos;d like to tell you what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
after the logic of this deception , this selbsttäuschung , the willingness , a different reality than the ones that we actually know in the unconscious , that it &apos;s gültig to spread out .
i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example of what many of you are familiar with and some of you , very few of you don &apos;t even need .
i mean my soul soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is the kind of an intellectual , about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that is not about stop , physical nature .
and if you &apos;ve got people who are , you have to have a soul , or you can say that you &apos;ve got to have a soul , or you can also say that as if you have a soul to life , it &apos;s from meat , just from meat and blood , a little bit of steinernes , sort of steinernes to the earth , vergängliches , verwesbares , verwesbares , unwichtiges , ja .
and from the soul , you think that somehow it &apos;s in this wolkigen nature , in this luftigen nature of nature , it &apos;s in the latin , the lufthauch .
and then if that lufthauch and then , if that is , it &apos;s filled with people , it &apos;s filled with , with nature , with nature that can only live with nature .
and then he can just davonlaufen .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s going to come from the outside to people .
so we &apos;re supposed to see them as something that is necessarily present to our lives .
and if you have this premise of eyes , you understand the logic that we &apos;re lucky about to be able to improve our world through a lie .
because now you can apply a dreisatz .
you &apos;re still familiar with school .
now this is a dreisatz , which describes us a logic .
this is the hardest part of my talk .
this is what you need to lie , but the willingness to lie .
namely , to lie , you know , you can use these logic wrong .
in this dreisatz , three sentences come in .
the first sentence is , klaus , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if klaus &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i put him in particular .
a third sentence that immediately comes up with people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have any soul , who &apos;s dead and can &apos;t say anything .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s the logic in this , yes , in this täuschenden talk to the expression .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , it makes sense correct .
because i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you about reality .
i can say the kanzlerin is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the kanzlerin is a man .
if i don &apos;t right , it &apos;s not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any statement about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but critically , when i &apos;m right , it &apos;s right .
so if klaus says , there &apos;s no soul .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical correct .
and now our most conscious consciousness feels instantly , you can do something .
it &apos;s a third sentence that doesn &apos;t have anything to do with the first two , and it &apos;s like that the opposite of the first sentence has already proven and assumed .
because actually , we need to prove if there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that it just uses two sentences , two sentences , and a third dazuhängt that looks like this , as if he would have something to do with it , so we can save our lebenslüge .
so , we &apos;re doing it as if it &apos;s impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue to continue these things in different examples .
in the present , we have a really modern example of modern example , the tageszeitungen füllt .
that &apos;s what you have to do is , you have to be another philosophisches issue , a dauerbrenner from philosophy of philosophy .
that &apos;s what we do to do it in the vierzehnte century .
there was a gelehrten who was called johannes buridanus , and after the buridansche named buridansche .
the buridansche esel is a esel , which is made of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
this is a naturding .
and if you put it exactly in the middle of the middle of two gleichgroßen , it verhungert .
because he doesn &apos;t know what haystack he is supposed to first .
so he &apos;s right in the middle of the middle .
that &apos;s the naturdinge .
gleichgroße forces with gegensätzlichem kräfte are solving each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
only if you get another example , so if you get a haystack bigger , it doesn &apos;t really need any reason to do it .
automatically he &apos;s going to the right thought .
if you have this idea that you &apos;re sort of driven in nature , determiniert , from the larger pile that you &apos;re going to put on a moment , you quickly have the feeling that there must be a free will .
and if we &apos;ve already been here in frankfurt , i remember the max-planck-institut of brain science .
there &apos;s a gelehrten that &apos;s called wolf singer , and by him sometimes , you can say , wolf singer , there &apos;s no willensfreiheit .
now we can create the second sentence again , and we can say , if wolf is right , he doesn &apos;t have a willensfreiheit .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can now read daily in the daily newspaper in the daily newspaper in this third sentence .
it looks something like who doesn &apos;t have any willensfreiheit , can &apos;t be able to be gezogen and claims to responsibility to responsibility , and it &apos;s unzurechnungsfähig .
you &apos;ve got it again .
actually , you have to prove to prove whether there &apos;s something like willensfreiheit .
but the logic of the deception allows us to do that , as if the first sentence would be wrong , you know , you would take the opposite of granted .
and now you can just do anything , if you want to test anything yourself , if you want to test anything yourself , and especially if you want to make people happy , that courage to lie .
do you practice this for example , if you meet a person that you can say , there &apos;s no vorhersager .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for vorhersager , the prophet .
you can &apos;t call it , that would be a little political inkorrekt .
say , there &apos;s no vorhersager .
immediately , you &apos;ll have one of those of course , you know , for granted , you can &apos;t prove it .
and you have a problem .
because while they &apos;re busy that they can &apos;t prove that they can &apos;t prove there is no vorhersager , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he fooled .
because he has led them to a fährte , which he didn &apos;t survive .
because this man is not really interested in evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in understanding itself in front of the need to prove to prove that there are vorhersager .
so , in the kind of shift , the beweislast , they &apos;re going to experience of the lie .
and once you have a way to feel that dreisatz in other people , they do do it , because they &apos;re going to make other happy if they don &apos;t remember their selbstlüge .
thank you for your attention .
yes , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve been allowing myself to say i can mention it .
she &apos;s one of the veranstalterinnen here from this great event , and she asked me if i wanted to give a talk here and provide my idea .
i have to say , you have , you know , at the beginning to talk to me at the beginning of my idea .
and may i think , perhaps , i &apos;m trying to introduce you to imagine .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum of all , very many ideas .
i &apos;m probably one of those two girls , i &apos;m probably one of the two girls , i &apos;m probably one of the two things that make the bad image of that bad image , because of course , i started studying engineering , because i &apos;ve started studying engineering , of engineering , technical school , which is , i think , kit .
and then , in the &apos; 80s , it was verschlagen to berlin berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and that was not in karlsruhe .
there was the kernforschungsanlage leopoldshafen .
they were all the kfa , even the jülich was called kfa .
the mean today .
because a good engineer either built great cars or atomkraftanlagen .
but this kind of doofes like n solarpendel , which comes out of the square meter coming out of square square , that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy ingenieurkollektiv .
i am grateful grateful that word that word again , because after the mauerfall , you don &apos;t have to use the word at all , because all the left was bad .
however , in the achtiziger years , it was not like this .
so there was that there was selbstverwaltete alternativbetriebe , and one of them was sitting in kreuzberg in kreuzberg , where they thought evil .
it was the place of the terrorismusses , but it was called wind and energy and solar power , and i started in the achtziger .
and yes , a lot of what was been said today , touches me , because many , many beautiful statements expressions that i &apos;ve lived through .
i worked for 11 years in the collective years , which was basisdemokratisch .
we were twenty people .
so if you have no , it was the vetoprinzip , it was a completely zermürbt , and i &apos;ve been very hard for 10 years , and i have been really hard to do that , if i think of my great ingenieurstudium , because all my colleagues , because all the colleagues of my father , you &apos;ve got the money to the window to your child .
it &apos;s struggling with you .
and this is really very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , a picture where i &apos;ve asked for 10 years , a thousand d-mark , who were , in the time , of course , einheitslohn , in a collective , of course , should be the great thing .
and i got it down to sechsundneunzig , and then we &apos;ve been with friends with friends with friends , which then became the spin-off q-cells of the world &apos;s größten .
now , of course , we &apos;ve got a riesenerfolgsgeschichte company , and we have zweitausendsechs , of course , and we think , of course , and we think , of course , it &apos;s a little bit crazy , and we think it &apos;s going to be crazy again , that people &apos;s beginning to say that people say what &apos;s going on , that &apos;s all we &apos;re going to talk about .
and i brought you with a project i brought you to imagine .
and the title of the presentation was , you know , a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started to start with a relatively einfach-verrückten story of questions , where you can use a memory of a memory today .
on this island , this is the island of graciosa on the azoren .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there are four and four and four and four and a half people .
they today have a renewables from renewable 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have any more ?
that &apos;s simply not technological .
if you zubauen more windkraft , the system starts to fail .
i &apos;m also telling the politicians in berlin-adlershof our facility .
they always say , why ?
we have 20 percent in germany .
but can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we &apos;ve seen seven percent , and our web is physically the european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , do it was zweitausend2006 , have the first contact with the island , but just calculate .
how big it would have to be a battery , so you &apos;re going to be an island in 20 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent .
and yes , i &apos;ll go back again .
the conventional system looks like this .
by the way , a year about a hundred gigawatt electrical performance in dieselbasis elektrische auf in the world .
this is the performance of a hundred nuclear power nuclear nuclear power , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the world &apos;s energiehunger , which is going to happen to be erased , because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s fast .
you make it a box .
and then it looks like this .
in that always , three of the dieseln , will always be waited .
yeah , this is a burden down there .
we also got some very accurate data .
and the windkraftanlage or the solaranlage , or whatever it is , is , in the rule , in the rule of a back-up system , which is just in small quantities in small quantities .
our goal was to say , okay , okay .
the diesel will be back-up and the wind , the load of the load , they can map the bigger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent of energy , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn off the diesel .
that means , in the moment , you have to care about the renewables that can take over the entire net .
and , of course , you can , of course , if you &apos;re in any way .
this has no one that yet .
that &apos;s in the small style , so you can also use your rasierer on a little wechselrichter .
people always ask me , what do you do in adlershof ?
it &apos;s already happening .
but if you want to do several of these wechselrichtern zusammenschalten , and they &apos;re supposed to build a net , it becomes extremely complicated .
and the goal was , we wanted to 70 to neunzig by neunzig by neunzig , and then there &apos;s the rest of the rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , it will be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work out of the batteries .
this is going to be a carbon footprint , which is then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , or sch , it will be .
and then you have to go up to a saisonalspeicher and not just tag-nacht .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s with a normal , stinknormalen battery battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then have made a whole bunch of simulation .
and the wind and the load , and the load and the load and the load and the burden , a very exciting result , a very exciting result of the conventional the conventional system of the conventional system that would take a middle of 50 cents a kilowattstunde from about 50 cents a kilowattstunde , about 50 cents .
that was the first calculation six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like diesel-system , if the dieselpreis is rising five percent a year .
and then we started negotiating with the insulanern .
what would all be done ?
with investors with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new gesellschafter .
we were just five people at the time to rebuild the society .
and this is the picture .
the brown is sort of the conventional system , the green system is our system .
that our system also has a preisanstieg , because we &apos;re going to do even twenty percent with diesel , and also eine on the other things .
and the power-utility that gemeint the elektrizitätsversorgungsunternehmen on the island , which is what we &apos;re doing quite great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin where we could sort of actually actually map of the island of the island at three of the time .
and that means we were looking for to find the greatest battery in the world .
here it is .
it &apos;s naturally from asia , in the case of japan .
and witzigerweise , she &apos;s mannheim in the &apos; 70s in the &apos; 70s , now abb , and it was auslizensiert , and then became auslizensiert .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has a megawatts of power and it can take six hours for six hours , and it &apos;s the battery that we sort of simulationstechnisch .
and then they set up .
and we also have one of these diesel-aggregate in the same size , which is where it &apos;s in the hall , in fact , to the whole dynamic behavior of this web , in the back , it looks like , in the back of the context , there &apos;s the big battery , there &apos;s the big battery , here are all the umrichter that we simulate the net .
over here , we actually simulate the whole übertragungsleitungsystem , the kilometer-physik of the wires to represent the schwingungsverhalten of the web .
and here you can see this again .
we can also photovoltaik kilowatt kilowatt kilowatt on the web .
this is what we see here again again , again , again , , again , again , again , einzelnen .
and what we did since , since zweitausendneun , has been done , until today , all of the things that have been done here today , between the single system of electronics , was made in software .
so we &apos;re not batteriehersteller , but we &apos;re defined as a company that &apos;s just between the subject of battery and the subject of web and everything in between .
you have to communicate to the battery , of course , you must communicate to the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the nice thing about the issue is that you &apos;re basically , in this island , all of the time that we &apos;re going to get to be able to get , if we want to increase our share of renewables .
so this whole discussion , how it &apos;s going to go back to the right now , energiewende , as it is to go back on the island , for example , for fünfundzwanzig by 30 percent , so we müdsen the wind and the sun .
natürlicht is bietet .
so smart-grid , a riesenthema everywhere .
well , we can start to integrate on the island of integrieren , rumzufragen , you can &apos;t manage the load .
that means if you &apos;re 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t make it without any memory .
you can smart-grid through the nets , you can do it by ausbau nets , yes , you know , you should also do , you know , the percentage of erhören , but you can never get on memory .
and that &apos;s the message of the message .
so many people are going to look at this too , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn off the diesel , then you don &apos;t have any more of this spinning that causes a certain inertia in the web of the web .
and our europäisches verbundnetz is basically nur masses of large kraftwerken , where the wave is around europe all around europe .
we &apos;re looking at this web , looking at 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s neunundvierzig komma at nine , we &apos;ll start a few ventilchen , again , again , again , again , again , we get back up .
this is the system .
and of course , that &apos;s incredibly high .
if you runterreißen that , it takes a while .
the spinning reserves has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and at the time they can respond to other things .
if you don &apos;t have that anymore , this spinning mass , you have to replace it with leistungselektronik and elektrochemie .
and we can once rein-rausschalten with this big battery .
and then you see that there &apos;s enormous geschwindigkeitsmöglichkeiten .
and the message is now , we need to be massen , 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 percent , 30 percent , 30 percent and so on , if we want to reach them .
then we have to break down our must-run capacity in the web .
must-run is simply called the power station to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a riesendebatte at the moment , zubau from the kohlekraftwerken , because we don &apos;t know , or gasturbinen , because that &apos;s not going .
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that you can see the capacity that can break down the capacity that can break down the capacity by using a elektrochemische memory .
so , fortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies .
and to that purpose , people are over and they &apos;re looking at our versuchsstand , sort of our inselteststand .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you get a piece of a long future .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years was similar , like the discussion i had in the last 30 years , in the last 30 years .
it &apos;s not , you know , schwachsinn , we have all gerechnet , we don &apos;t count .
we have 30 gigawatt photovoltaik in germany today .
this is vorbildlich .
and i just go out of that , in the next 30 years of the same dreißig , in the next 30 years , the same capacity of elektrochemischen store in the world .
very simple , it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s going to be a whole bunch of widerständen and arguments .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve seen in the last two years that the scientists are going to ask themselves .
we &apos;ve got to get over 10 million förderprojekte now , in order to klemmen on the german net .
that &apos;s going to happen in the next april .
so you know , you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change , and it &apos;s only from this abwehrhaltung to yes , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable is true .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a autarkes system .
so , in discussions , there &apos;s always been trying to try and try to get these insulaner , they &apos;re going to have their own little web , which has nothing to do with our verbund .
the question is , very simple , if you &apos;re completely independent by some fossil or uranen , which will be rausgebohrt somewhere in the world , and you &apos;re going to be hingebracht , you &apos;re an island .
then they &apos;re just using the sun and the wind is there , where they live .
and this is kind of a little bit of our vision of a vernüftigen energy supply of energy , and i &apos;m also grateful that they &apos;ve said , use solar power .
and that &apos;s what we do , and that &apos;s in the way , the talk about premium kola , that you can again , you can use a collective and use solar power , here &apos;s a little bit together .
and yes , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can quiet a little bit crazy and have a vision .
and you really have to be quite zäh , but i think it &apos;s going .
thank you .
as steve lopez , kolumnist of los angeles times , one day by the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , sympathisch , homeless , homeless , who played on a violin , that only two strings .
a lot of you will know the story , because from steves , there &apos;s been a book , which was verfilmt , which was verfilmt , and jamie foxx , when steve anthony and jamie foxx als , who was at the juilliard-konservatorium , who was at the juilliard-konservatorium and whose promising career was ended early early early by his paranoide schizophrenia .
nathaniel just left , suffered , suffered , and 30 years later he had lived on the streets of skid row row in the center of los angeles .
so , i recommend all of you to read about reading , or to look at the movie of the movie so you can &apos;t just read the wonderful connection between these two men , but also how the music was making this connection , and how it ended up with the instrument , if that is allowed to get the mithalf , nathaniel away from the street .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , walt walt disney disney hall .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony and came up with the stage to imagine me .
he was speaking in a very heiteren and geselligen sound about yo-yo and hillary clinton clinton clinton clinton and how the dodgers could never make it into the baseball world , and this is all because of the tückischen passage of the last sentence in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
we came to talk to music , and a few days later , i got an email , which was that nathaniel was interessierte for me .
i have to say that nathaniel is a medical treatment , because he was already dealing with electric and thorazin and add , a trauma that has followed him his whole life .
so , as a result , it &apos;s very vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and it disappears for days , in the streets of skid row row , always the horror and the folterqualen of his own mind .
and in fact , in the case , nathaniel was nathaniel , when we started with our first class in walt disney hall , he had this irre flackern in his eyes and worked completely .
he was talking about invisible and smoke and about how somebody wanted to poison him in sleep .
i was afraid , not meinetwegen , but i was afraid that i could lose it in one of his condition , and i could destroy his relationship with the violin , when i started to destroy over a scale and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didaktischen .
so i just started playing .
i played the first set of beethoven &apos;s first sentence .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in nathaniels &apos;s eyes , a total change was happening .
it was like he was under the impact of a invisible drug , a chemical response that was my game .
nathaniels manischer anger turned into understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace .
and as a miracle he took his violin , and he began to play some clips of violinkonzerten and then asked me to get them to the end : mendelssohn , tschaikowski , sibelius .
and then we started talking about music , starting from bach to talk about beethoven , brahms , bruckner and all the other bs , from bartók to esa-pekka .
and i realized that he was not just knowing a enzyklopädisches knowledge of music , but also with her a close personal relationship .
he was talking about her with a passion and an understanding that i know about my colleagues in the philharmonie of los angeles .
by playing music and talked about music , it was from this paranoiden , confused man who had moved to los angeles , a liebenswerter , gebildeter , fine , great , in juilliard ausgebildeter musicians .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means emotional health .
because the music allows him to have his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he zuständen his quälenden states .
i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
this is the reason why we &apos;re doing music : we &apos;re doing something that in all of us , deep inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens lens , through our creativity , through our creativity .
and the reality that expression comes to us all of us , and move , inspired us .
what nathaniel anging , he brought the music back into a community of friends .
the erlösende force of music brought him back into a family of musicians who recognized his talent and achtete him .
and i &apos;m going to keep with nathaniel music , no matter whether disney disney concert hall or in row row , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play a little bit of play the cellisten .
i hope you forgive me .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first one was more like a passionate affäre .
it was a beautiful fish , wohlschmeckend , good consistency , gehaltvoll , a bestseller on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it was grown into aquakultur after the intended highest standards of sustainability .
so you could be able to sell it to sell him .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
and one day , the head of the company called the company , asked if i could give you , i could give you know if i could tell you about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
and here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem for our chefs is , how do we keep fish on our speisekarten ?
in the last 50 years , we have gefischt the ocean how we were kahl .
it &apos;s hard to überbewerten the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the tuna , the lachse , the lachse , they have collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so it &apos;s going to be übel , fischanbau , part of our future .
a lot of arguments . fischzuchtanlagen verschmutzen the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a futterverwertung from 15 to one .
that means , 15 pounds of wildfisch , you need to get a pound .
not very sustainable .
don &apos;t tastes tastes very well .
so , finally , there was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to supported them .
the day before the event , i called the head of öffentlichkeitsarbeit for the company .
let &apos;s call him don &apos;t .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; just to grow the facts right , you &apos;re famous to grow in the ocean that you don &apos;t verschmutzt the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out of the waste of our fish , not focused . &quot;
and then he added it , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
and he said to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.5 to one thing ? what feeds her ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put it up .
and at that night i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day i called off the next day , right before , don &apos;t go .
i said , &quot; don , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know it . he &apos;s going to think .
well , i telefonierte with a couple of people in the company . nobody could give me a ordentliche answer . until i finally telefonierte biologists .
let &apos;s call him don &apos;t .
&quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some fischmehle , and then he said , hühnchen-pellets .
i said , &quot; hühnchen-pellets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , reste , reste , getrocknet and work . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your futters is chicken ? &quot;
maybe two percent of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable to feed fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause at the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i &apos;m entliebte from this fish .
no , not , because i &apos;m a selbstgerechter genießer and gutmensch .
that &apos;s me .
no , i actually habe out of this fish , because , i swear at god who tasted fish after that conversation after chicken .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love of love .
it &apos;s the romantic way that you know , the better you learn your fish , you get the fish the more .
i first ate him in a restaurant in südspanien .
a befreundete journalist had spoken for a long time from this fish .
it &apos;s sort of verkuppelt us .
he came at the table with a bright , almost schimmernden white color .
the chef had verkocht him .
twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish taste as well after he was verkocht ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , it &apos;s miguel .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least on the way that they and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
this is a fischaufzucht in the südwestlichen corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentiniern .
they were raised fleischrinder on what was basically feuchtgebiete .
they did that by entwässerten the country .
they built this complicated consequence of channels , and they kept water out of the country and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make it , not economically .
and climb was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds in which there are many birds .
and so , in 1982 spanish company , this spanish bought the country .
what did you do ?
you have the flow of the water .
they literally have the lever .
instead of herauszudrängen , they used the channels , they used the channels to hereinzuziehen the water .
they fluteten the channels .
they created a 11.000 hektar -- barsch -- barsch , meeräsche , shrimp , aal -- and they have miguel , and their company completely versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all they see is geflutete channels and these density , lush march .
i was not a long time ago with miguel .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and part of &quot; a crocodile for the kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were and fighting through the feuchtgebiete and i keuche and schwitze , and schwitze , i have matsch up to my knees , and miguel .
this is where it lifts a rare gleitaar .
now he mentioned the mineralbedürfnisse of phytoplankton .
and here , here he sees a pattern of concentrate that was reminded him at the tansanische giraffe .
and it turns out that miguel the most part of his career in the mikumi national national national park in africa .
i asked him how to become such a fisch-experten .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes , and it takes more talk about rare birds of rare birds and algae wasserpflanzen .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotische community .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this verkochte piece of köstlichen fish that i had at the vorabend .
so i cut him down . i said , &quot; miguel , how is it that your fish tastes so good ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the algae , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do your fish ?
how is the futterverwertung ? &quot;
well , he &apos;s going to continue to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish would eat what they would eat in the wild .
the vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zoo , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely selbsterneuernd .
there &apos;s no food .
depending from a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
and then , the day i was driving around on this site , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be like that , unlike every farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you do success ? &quot;
in the moment , it was like a director had to have to have a bühnenwechsel .
and we bogen around the corner , and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinker flamingos , literally a pinker carpet as far as far as the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at her bäuche , pink .
they schlemmen . &quot;
schlemmen ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; miguel , don &apos;t you get your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fischeiern to the birds .
now , last year , on this site , 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s become the biggest and one of the most important private systems in europe .
and i said , &quot; miguel , is a good gedeihender not the last thing you want to have on a fischaufzucht ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building extensiv , not intense .
this is a ökologisches network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat phytoplankton .
so the pinker of the belly the stomach the belly . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feeds your animals and a farm that measures your success on the health of your predators .
one fischaufzucht , but also a vogelreservat .
oh , and by the way , it doesn &apos;t even be there .
they breed in a city 240 kilometers away where the bodenbeschaffenheit is better for the nestbau .
every morning , she fly 240 kilometers to a farm .
and every night they fly 240 kilometers .
they do that because they can follow the gestrichelten white line of landstraße .
seriously .
i had imagined some kind of a journey of the penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , &quot; miguel , you fly 240 miles to the farm and you fly 240 miles back on the evening ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me when i was quoted a song from the whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do it because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fischhaut . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this beißende , verkohlte taste .
i almost never cook .
and yet , when i tried it in this restaurant , she didn &apos;t tasted it at all .
she liked cute , and she liked it as if you would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this to miguel , and he nickte .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense footprint before something in the body .
it &apos;s evolved throughout evolution to unreinheiten unreinheiten . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no unreinheiten . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your fish . a farm that measures your success is the success of your predators .
and then i realized , when he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a unreinheiten , he gewaltig massive , because the water that goes through this farm comes in from the river guadalquivir .
it &apos;s a river that leads to all the things that are going on , the rivers of these days , to lead them , chemical pollutants , flow of schädlingsbekämpfungsmitteln .
and when it fought through the system , and this leaves the water is clean than it &apos;s hereingekommen .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that &apos;s erfolg their success on the health of their health , but a farm literally is a wasser-aufbereitungsanlage , and not just for those fish , but also for you and me .
because when the water herausfließt , it versinkt it in the atlantic .
one drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and you should do it , because this love story , like romantic , also , is also aufschlussreich .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about barsch or fleischrindern .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one , in which food is actually good .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit to radical .
we &apos;re not realisten , we &apos;re genießer . we &apos;re lover .
we love wochenmärkte . we love small familienbetriebe . we &apos;re talking about local food . we &apos;re eating food .
and if you claim that the future of good food is someone in the future , and says , &quot; hey , people , i love pinke flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not , because we &apos;re producing calories to feed the world more than only to feed .
a billion people are starving today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of krasser inequalities in the distribution , not the gesamtproduktion .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because it has the logic of our nahrungssystems over the last 50 years .
feed crops , schädlingsbekämpfungsmittel , chemicals on the earth , schädlingsbekämpfungsmittel of fish , and all the time , they just wondered , &quot; when we feed more people , how awful can it be ? &quot;
this was the cause . it was the basic business plan . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a craft in abwicklung , a craft that makes ökologisches capital capital capital that allows this production .
this is not an industry , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our kornkammer is now threatened today , not because of abnehmender zufuhr , but because of abnehmender resources .
not through the latest mähdrescher- and traktor-erfindungen , not through pumps , but by frisches water , not through kettensägen , but by forests , and not through fischerboote and nets , but through fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
so let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create the conditions that enable every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agrarindustrie-modell for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are obenan and it has never made something really good to eat .
now , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is that , in two billion years of arbeitserfahrung zurückgreift .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
in those who are not the worlds for themselves , businesses that are wiederherstellen , rather than aufzubrauchen , farmers who are not just erzeuger , they &apos;re not just erzeuger , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are also experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;m ever going to be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because when the future is good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
so , if i want to illustrate one thing today , the full of data that we consume is that the full of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of your parts and instead of thinking about informationsüberladung , i want you to think about how we can use information about how to make information , and we see the trends that otherwise have never been visible .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical sterbediagramm sterbediagramm age .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pivot , and what i can do with pivot is that i can filter to a certain cause of death , we say .
and i see a different pattern that makes up .
and that &apos;s because in the mittelbereich here , the people are active and they &apos;re over here over here .
we can take one step further away and see the data , and see that kreislauferkrankungen and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
so , if we go on and say , we see 40 years old , we see that accidents are actually the main cause of the leading people to make people care about .
and who is still true , is true at men .
so , you know , look at information and data in this way , this is very much about swimming in a living informationsgrafik .
and if we can do this for raw data , why isn &apos;t content for itself ?
so what we &apos;ve got here is the titelbilder of every single sport illustrated , which has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
they &apos;d like to test it after my zimmern .
with pivot , they can dive in a decade .
they can dive in a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
so when i look here , i see the athlete that appear in this issue and the sportarten .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong a fan , so i click on this , so i &apos;m going to show all expenses in which armstrong recorded armstrong .
now , if i just want to get a gröberen review , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at anything with the theme ? &quot;
so i go a step back and erweitere the perspective .
now i see greg lemond .
and so you get an idea of that if you hit this kind of information , gezielter , wider , rauszoomen , you don &apos;t look for it or not just surft .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it &apos;s changing the way information can be used .
i &apos;d like to do a little bit further about what a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is , we &apos;ve taken every single wikipediaseite and down to a little summary .
the summary is a short in the summary , and a symbol of that she comes from .
i &apos;ll just show the top 500 top of the top .
but even in that limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense about the issues that are at wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to vote the issue .
now , after i &apos;ve chosen government , i know that the wikipediakategorien that are most magazines in the most magazines people .
this is really important , because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single wikipediaseite .
it &apos;s only to see if you go back and look at the whole thing .
so , in a certain of this summaries , i can go to time magazines people of the year , and i can see all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i know that the majority of them are regierungsbeamte . some of them come from science , some of them are coming out of the economy . there is my boss . and one comes from the musikbereich .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize .
so we can jump up and look at all the ted prize .
you see , we &apos;re surfing on the web for the first time , as if it &apos;s really a net , not just from page to side , but much more abstract .
and so i would like to show you what a little surprise could be .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with this -- and we bring these zoom-technologie to every single website like this .
so i can go back to a step , and i can jump directly to a specific sektion .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s important , because you can only look at these websites of websites in this way , that can look at the same way .
so , i can zoom into my course in a particular time .
here &apos;s the state of the whole demonstration that i gave up to here .
and i can kind of look at everything i &apos;ve been looking at today , again .
and , if i take a step back and look at everything , i can neu for my course , and i &apos;ve been looking for the course , i &apos;ve been looking for &apos; , looking for bing , or here , live labs .
and from here i can go back to the site and go back to the site .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over again , and every time it makes it bigger than the sum of the datenteile .
at the moment , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the fluch .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation around and the internet on the mind , so that instead of going to go from one to the other , from many of many things , can be able to be able to be able to have a lot of things that were otherwise hidden from ?
if we can do this , then this past will be datenfalle , maybe a new source of information .
and , rather than just moving in information , we can know that .
and if we know , maybe we can even weisheiten out of it .
i hear that , thank you very much .
i grew up with a gehörigen deal of science fiction .
in my high school , i went to school with the bus every day , an hour .
and my nose always was in a book , a science-fiction-buch science-fiction-buch , which my thoughts in other worlds and in a erzählerische way , in me , my deep curiosity , i think of befriedigte .
and this curiosity also showed that i was , when i was not in school , through the forests , walked around and snakes and snakes and snakes and teichwasser , and looked at all home , and looked at the microscope .
i was completely wissenschaftsbegeistert , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and understand the limits of the kinds of explore .
and my love of science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment , because , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his amazing shows that animals and the places and a world full of wonder that we never had before .
so it &apos;s got to be very good at the science-fiction-rolle .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and because there was neither video games with computergenerierten movies , the whole imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to do that at all the time , so if we read kids a book , we took the description of the autors , and they projizierten them on the canvas in our heads .
and my reaction was to draw and paint from aliens , alien worlds , robots , raumschiffen and all .
in the matheunterricht , i was caught by the teachers all the time , like i was hidden in the back textbook , herummalte .
creativity had to be kind of out .
and what happened was something interesting to me , which was fascinated by jacques cousteaus shows , the thought of a totally unknown world here on our earth itself .
certainly , i would never reach an alien world with a spaceship . it seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i could actually walk out here on the earth , and she was just as fascinating and exotic as all of what i had always imagined when i had read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 to become diver .
the only problem was that i lived in a little village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the next ocean .
but i didn &apos;t let me frustrated .
i &apos;m nervte my father , until finally he finally had a tauchschule in buffalo , new york , right on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my tauchschein in a pool of ymca in the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , the real ocean , i only got two years later when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 15,000 hours under water , and i spent about 10,000 hours of it , 500 hours of it .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flacheren ocean oceans , even as rich as we can &apos;t even imagine .
nature doesn &apos;t know borders , in contrast to our own , kläglichen human imagination .
now , for today , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my tauchgängen .
and my love to the ocean stops , with the same intensity as ever and ever .
so when i got a profession , as an adult , it was the filmmaking .
that seemed the best way to tell my inner urge to tell stories with my need to unite .
as a child , i was drawing comic books and so .
so movies were the way of getting images and stories . that fit together .
of course , the stories that i &apos;m going to get out of the science-fiction-bereich , from the science-fiction-bereich , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
and i could connect my predilection for the unterwasserwelt and das .
so , basically , my two loves .
something interesting happened in &quot; abyss : to solve a erzählerisches problem in this film -- and that we had to create such a kind of liquid animation -- we put on computergenerierte animation , cg , cg , back .
what came out of this was the first computergenerierte soft-surface-figur ever to see in a movie .
the movie didn &apos;t have a money , in fact , he played his manufacturing program , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like hypnotisiert by the magic that came out .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , you know , you know , you can &apos;t be unterscheiden from each other .
so you saw something magic .
and that &apos;s what i found incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , it &apos;s got to be involved in the filmkunst . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , even further .
together with ilm , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success depended on how that effect was going to be .
and it worked . again , we made something magical magical , and the effect in the audience was the same . however , with the movie a little bit more money .
from these two experiences , it was a whole new world , a new world of creativity for filmschaffende .
so , i set up a company , with my good friend stan , who was the best make-up- and creature-designer , which was called digital domain .
the basic idea of this company was , the phase of analog processes with visual printers , etc , etc .
and then we did , and we managed to have an advantage for a while .
but in the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the creature- and character-design -- what we did actually have created the company -- too slowly , too slowly .
i had written this piece &quot; avatar , &quot; which is written in things of visual effects and computergenerierter effects effects of effects in all of new heights , with realistischen human characters , which were made by cg , and the hauptfiguren should be all cg , and the world should be cg .
but the messlatte hit the ganz , and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not able to be able to do that .
so i shifted this and made this other film on the big ship that will fall .
i &apos;ve been selling this as &quot; romeo and juliet and juliet and juliet on a ship , it became a liebesfilm epischen order , a passionate movie .
but i actually wanted to hinabtauchen for the real train of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i did the movie .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i believe it by saying , &quot; we come up to the train . we start the real wrack .
we &apos;re going to show it in the eröffnungssequenz of the movie .
this is immensely important . it &apos;s a good aufhänger of marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but again , again , that &apos;s going back to your imagination that can create a reality .
we actually made six months later a reality where i was in a russian tauchboot wiederfand , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i was looking at the real titanic through a bullauge .
it wasn &apos;t a movie , no hd , that was real .
so that really blew my mind .
and the amount of preparation was enormous . we had to build cameras and light and everything .
and i fell on how much these tiefseetauchgänge , a weltraummission similar .
well , they were also hochtechnisch and bedurften greater planning .
you go up into this capsule , you get into this dark , feindselige environment , where you &apos;re not going to be a hope , if you don &apos;t get back to yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a science-fiction-film .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
anyway , from the part of doing curiosity with curiosity and science , it was all . it was curiosity , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that could not give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the fensters .
in some of the following expeditions , i saw creatures in thermalquellen , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that had never seen before , and for the science , when we saw them , had no words at all .
so that &apos;s really umgeworfen me , and i wanted to get more .
and so i was meeting some unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said to myself , &quot; ok , i want to put my hauptberuf as a filmmaker in hollywood , and put it up for a while . &quot;
and then we started looking at the bismarck , and then we were exploring with roboterfahrzeugen .
we went back to the train of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which had a fiberglaskabel abwickelten .
our purpose was to look at hineinzutauchen , and look at the ship of the ship , which was never been done before .
no one had explored the inside of the wracks . you didn &apos;t have any resources for it . so we developed the technology .
so , here i &apos;m sitting there , on the deck of the titanic , in a tauchboot , in a tauchboot , and i see these brettern here , and i know that once the band was played there .
and i &apos;ll fly with a little roboterfahrzeug from the ship .
so , i &apos;m just bediene it , but my consciousness is in the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically in the titanic of the titanic .
it was the surrealste form of a déjà-vu that i &apos;ve ever experienced . because before i take a corner , i always knew what was going on in the lichtkegel of the vehicle , because i had months of filmset , when we made the film .
because the set was an accurate copy of the ship .
so this was an extremely strange experience .
and she made me realize that you &apos;re going to use such roboterhafte , and so your conscious awareness of the vehicle , in the vehicle that other form of existence .
it was really profound profound .
and maybe a little view of what could happen in a few decades when you &apos;ve got cyborg-körper to do something or do other things , in all kinds of post-humanen zukunftszenarios that i can imagine as a science-fiction-fan .
so after these expeditions , we started what we started to really appreciate what we &apos;ve seen in the bottom , for example , for example , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are sort of alien , but here on earth .
they live with chemosynthese .
they don &apos;t exist in one on sunlight on sunlight , as we do .
and this is the animals that see right next to a 500 degrees centigrade mean they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also interested in weltraumwissenschaft , which was back in my childhood again .
and so , i ended up with the people who are interested in space and right , and right now , they go through russia , they go through the mission in front of the mission , and it &apos;s going through the end of all the time and it &apos;s going to the international weltraumstation , and then they take our 3d-kamerasysteme .
that was fascinating .
but at the end of the end , it was that i took weltraumwissenschaftler with us in the deep sea .
i took them down to the world down there : astrobiologen , planetenwissenschaftler , people who were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources so that they were looking around samples , and they could test instruments .
so , we did this , but we were doing science , actually , in fact , weltraumwissenschaft .
and so the circle of my existence , as a child , as a child , and the practice in reality .
in the course of this voyage , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure now , you know , a director must lead to be a leader like a schiffskapitän or something .
but i didn &apos;t understand much about leadership before i antrat these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what comes out ? &quot;
these blöden films don &apos;t make us a money .
we &apos;re just playing the manufacturing manufacturing . some of fame .
everybody thought i &apos;m between &quot; titanic &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have the nails somewhere on a towel on a towel on the beach .
i &apos;ve all got these movies , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no glory , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it for the sake of the challenge , and the ocean is the most powerful environment that there are . you &apos;re doing it because of the entdeckerrausches , and because of the weird connection that happens when a small group of people form a team .
because we &apos;ve done all of this with 10 to 12 people who are working over for years , sometimes we were two to three months in the sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing that you have to be aware of each other , because you have a task that you can &apos;t explain to anyone else .
now , if you come back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , &quot; we had to do it , the ganze , the human leistungsvermögen , &quot; you &apos;re working on the other , you can &apos;t explain the other thing . this is like policemen or in soldiers who have gone through something together and know that they can never explain somebody .
there &apos;s a connection , a gegenseitiger respect .
so when i went back to turn my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; trying to use the same leadership , which is that you are respected his team , respected your team in return .
this is really changing the dynamic .
so , i stood up with a little team on unbekanntem terrain terrain we made a &quot; avatar , &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t have before .
so exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were a four and a half years to a real family .
so , by changing my way , my way of making films completely .
there were people who thought we were really good at these ozeanwesen , and they were transported on the planet .
for me , it was more a prinzipielle way to do my job , the actual process that changed in the result .
so what can we get out of all this ?
what lessons we learned ?
i think , first of all the curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the achtung of your team is more important than all the lorbeer of the world .
to me , there are young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me some advice i can do . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t you .
you &apos;ll get others for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , bet not against yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such a lieblingssatz : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art and in the arts , failure has to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a vertrauensvorschuss .
no important endeavor , the innovation , the innovation was ever addressed without risk .
you have to be prepared to take risks .
that &apos;s the idea i &apos;d like to give you the way to the way . fail to be an alternative , but not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and that might be surprising to , because my vollzeitbeschäftigung at the foundation of vaccines in the foundation of vaccines , vaccines , to be the things that we invent and deliver and deliver the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than anyone else on the planet .
klimaverschlechterung means that their saaten are not going to grow over many years , we &apos;re going to be too much or less rain . the things are going to change their fragile fragile environment .
this leads to hungersterben . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to unruhen .
so , the climate change will be terrible for you .
also , it &apos;s very important for them .
in fact , if you could just reduce the price of the price , it would be energy to the most effective thing .
well , the energiepreis is like time .
in fact , the fortschrittsgesellschaft is auf .
the kohlerevolution drive the industrial revolution and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the elektrizitätspreis , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , klimaanlagen , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we cut the price -- let &apos;s get the price in half -- we make a new barrier and this barrier with co2 with co2 .
co2 and the equation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
they summieren the ausgestoßene of co2 , which leads to temperaturerhöhung , and this temperaturerhöhung has some very negative consequences . effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the indirekte , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt such rapid changes and zusammenfallen whole systems .
now , the exact relationship between a co2-anstieg and where it &apos;s going to follow the other consequences , there are some questions , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i &apos;ve asked the top-wissenschaftler several times , &quot; do we really have to come down to zero ?
it &apos;s not enough or a quarter ? &quot;
and the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature goes up .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different from saying , we have a 3.5 square truck , which has got a three square bridge , and then you can put it under it .
this has to go down to the bottom , zero .
well , we run a lot of kohlenstoffdioxid every year , over 26 billion tons .
every american is about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and somehow we need to produce change that goes down to zero .
it has been constantly up .
only different economic changes have been affected at all , and we need to go from rapidem rise and go to a reduction to zero to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of a little bit , you have this thing on the left -- a little bit , and it &apos;s going to depend on the number of people , from the service that every person on average , the average energy for service and co2 , which is a unit of energy per unit .
so let &apos;s look at every single factor of each , and think about how we get to zero .
probably one of those numbers have to be very close to zero .
now this is basic algebra algebra , but we go through it .
first , we have the population .
today , 6,8 billion people .
and it &apos;s going to step on nine billion zu. to move on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the gesundheitsvorsorgung and reproduktionsmedizin , we could cut that down 10 percent to 15 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we &apos;re seeing a slope by 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
it &apos;s all the food that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
these are very good things and armutsverringerung means to make almost everyone on the planet almost everyone .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we may be able to use abstriche and use less , but on average , the number is going to go up every year and have more than double , the number of services that will be put together per person .
here we see a very basic service service . is it home at home so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they &apos;re going out and read their schulaufgaben under the straßenlicht .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy a service , there &apos;s good news .
we have something that goes up .
because of different successes in the lichtsektor , by other autotypen , through new ways of häuserbau , there &apos;s a lot of services , whose energy some of them are going to service for 90 percent .
in other service , like making düngemitteln , 105 00 : 56,000 -- &amp; -- &amp; : &amp; -- &amp; : 58,000 or the luftverkehr or luftverkehr , or luftverkehr , is a lot smaller .
overall , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may be able to get a factor of three or maybe even about a factor .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;re now going from 26 billion tons , and we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 per unit of energy .
it turns out whether you can get it to zero .
when you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every herstellungsmethode for electricity today today , except renewables and nuklearenergie .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energiewunder .
now , when i use the &quot; miracle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these wonders .
and usually there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a certain date .
so , normally , you know , you &apos;re just wrong and some of them , others don &apos;t .
in this case , we have to get vollgas and get a miracle in very short time .
well , i wondered , how can i get out of this ?
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that inspired the idea of people here ?
i remember last year , when i got mosquitos and somehow , people liked this .
the idea was really tangible , you know that there are people who live with mosquitos .
so for energy , this is one .
and i decided that , from fireflies , this would be my diesjähriger contribution to the environment .
so here are some natural fireflies .
i told you that they don &apos;t bite . they don &apos;t even be leaving the glass .
well , there are all kinds of spielereilösungen like this , but they don &apos;t get a lot .
we need solutions , either one or and unimaginable for a lot of scale , and even though there are many directions where people look for this , i &apos;m really just five to see that big demands .
i have the tides , geothermal , fusion fusion and biofuels .
and if you can afford to do a moderaten , and if you do better than i expect , you might be great , but my statement here is that we have to work on all of those five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they all have significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , combustion from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do is maybe simple , but it &apos;s not , you know , you would have all the co2 that go from burning out of the schornstein , to capture , to capture the pressure and hope to be there .
there are some of the pilotprojekte that can create it on a 60 percent -- 80 percent of them , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to the lagerung of co2 , is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the lagerzeitfrage .
who will make sure ?
who can guarantee what you can do , literally , many billion times larger than any kind of waste you can imagine from nuklear- and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a hard problem .
next : nuklearenergie .
they also have three big problems , and the cost of the cost of three big problems , and the question of sure that you really feel that you can go wrong , despite the human collaboration , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that you should work on .
i have the last three of the five of the five .
they are renewables as they &apos;re called a lot .
and also , even though it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
one is the energy density that these technologies are generating dramatically lower than kraftwerken .
these are energiefarmen , you &apos;re talking about many quadratkilometern times more land than a normal power station .
also , these sources are unterbrechungen .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all the day , it doesn &apos;t seem to appear every day , and it doesn &apos;t fall the wind all the time .
so you know , if you depend on those sources , you have a way to have energy in times when you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s great preisherausforderungen here . if we say that the energy source is outside the country , you don &apos;t just need the technology ; you have to deal with the risk of where it comes from where it comes from .
and there &apos;s lagerungsproblem .
and i &apos;ve got to show you all sorts of the batteries , and i &apos;ve got to show all sorts of the batteries that are made for cars , and i &apos;ve got a lot of the electronic energy that uses the world , but i found that all the batteries we produce now produce less than 10 minutes of gesamtenergie .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be a factor 100 than the approaches to be a factor .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
that &apos;s what happens if you &apos;re trying to get these unterbrochenen sources over , we &apos;ll say 20 percent -- 30 percent of it .
if you want to support 100 percent of them , you need an incredible wunderbatterie .
now , where are we going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds .
in each of these five areas we need at least 100 people .
you &apos;re going to say , you &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group , there are many that have been engaged in there .
bill big , bill has several companies , among other things called esolar the great solarthermaltechnologien .
vinod khosla invested in dozens of companies that are doing great things and interesting opportunities , and i try to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i funded a company that , maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the nuklearbereich ; modular , liquid .
now , this industry has stopped in this industry a few time ago , so there &apos;s no big surprise that some good concepts around this industry .
the terrapower-konzept means that instead of one percent of the urans , the one percent , the one percent , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking for a long time , but you could never have thought about it , but you could never be able to do it , but then there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that : yes , with the right materialienherangehensweise , it looks like this , it &apos;s functioning .
and because you burn that 99 percent , the kostenprofil is a lot better .
in fact , you burn the garbage , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s reactors as a antriebsstoff .
instead of breaking your head , you &apos;re just burning it . a great thing .
and uranium uses gradually , a little bit like a candle .
you can see , it &apos;s a kind of column , often called the wandernde wave wave of reactor .
this really solves the treibstoffproblem .
here &apos;s a picture of place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part of the 99 , so it &apos;s called aufgebrauchtes uranium .
the u.s. triebe the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re ozeanwasser cheap and just filtriert , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal we have to do , and then we talk about the zwischenschritt .
many are about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent are produced in the poor countries , and there &apos;s still a lot of agriculture , and hopefully to be clean up and cement .
so , to reach this 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , their elektrizitätsgeneration completely .
the other note says whether we &apos;re using the null-emissionen technology , whether it &apos;s in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s going to be a key element .
if we go back from there , what should this look testimony to 2020 ?
it should be the two elements again .
we should use the effektivitätsmaßnahmen to get down to the way to get down . the less we emittieren , the less it &apos;s going to be the co2-summe and the temperature .
but actually , this note is the note that we &apos;re doing , which we do not completely lead to the big reduktionen , just the same , or even less important as the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
we need to use these breakthroughs with vollgas , and we can measure this : in firmenzahlen , in pilotprojekten and regulierungsänderungen .
there are many great books on this topic .
and the al gore book , &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david mckays , &quot; sustainable energy without the hot air . &quot;
they really go through and create a framework that can be discussed across this wide , because we need support of all sides .
there &apos;s a lot of things coming together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very konkreter wish that we make this technology .
if you &apos;re just a wish for me for the next 50 years , i could pick up the president years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love , or i could choose this wish , which is halbierter energiepreis energiepreis without co2 will take that wish .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , it &apos;s going to dig up between the long term , between people , between the u.s. and china , between the poor and rich , and almost all of the lives of this two billion will be much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to use for more forschungsgelder .
when countries make themselves in places like koppenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should talk to those innovationsstrategie , and they would be shocked by the ridiculous small funds that are going to spend in these innovative approaches .
we need marktanreize , cap &amp; amp ; trade something that creates a preissignal .
we need to spread the message .
we need to have dialogue and full and all the things that are being done by government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand a little bit better -- first of all , can you give us an idea of scale of the investment ?
so bill gates : to be able to do the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all of the great scientists that we &apos;ve made , we only need a few 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it works reasonable , you &apos;re only in the 100en million .
the hard step is to build the first reaktors , find more billion , the regularien , and the place of actually building the first of it .
once the first thing is , when the first thing is , when he promised , it &apos;s all clearly clear , because the profit that &apos;s energy density is as different as nuklearenergie , as we know .
in order to understand this is really to build in the ground in the ground in the ground almost like a vertical column , that needed , and then the process starts the top , and it &apos;s working down ?
bg : right . now , you still have to neu the reactor , so there are many people and lots of controls that can go wrong . this thing where you open it up and stuff , or herausbringt . that &apos;s not good .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can take it for 60 years -- think of a column -- you &apos;re buried in , without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there , and it &apos;s done 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
it &apos;s a nuklearreaktor that offers a solution to the trash .
bg : yeah . now , what happens to the waste : you can sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less garbage with this method -- take it and put it into the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the garbage that already exists in those kühlbecken , which are in these reactors , and this is our startbrennstoff .
so what these reactors was a problem with a problem , which is what we put in our own and that it &apos;s going to reduce dramatically during the process .
but as you &apos;ve talked to different people in the world about these possibilities .
where is the most interested in what really to do ?
bg : now we haven &apos;t yet determined in a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting offenlegungsregeln for everything in russia , india , india , china -- i was here , and i &apos;ve talked to the energieminister and talked about how to fit the energieagenda .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the direction .
this is a variation of one thing that was made .
this is a more important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster one of the countries that made a quick reactor , so anyone who has a quick reactor , a kandidatat for our first .
in your imagination , zeitrahmen and more likely to really be in your life ?
bg : now we need one of these skalierbaren , stromgenerierenden things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then for 20 years .
this is basically the deadline that we &apos;ve seen the umweltmodelle that we have to follow .
and , you know , terrapower , if everything works well , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could make it easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of companies , and we need hundreds of them , as if they work for their pilots , they can mitbieten for their pilots .
and it would be best if it can do it , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
about the big possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest one you know ?
bg : a energiedurchbruch is the most important thing .
it would have been without the umweltherausforderung , but that &apos;s the power .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but there &apos;s the modular method , which is another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid reaktortyp that seems a little difficult , but maybe they say that about us .
and so there &apos;s a number of times , but the beauty is that there is a million times a million times as much energy as a , say , a kohlemolekül , and that &apos;s basically the radiation , the footprint and the cost , is the potential to play the potential , so it &apos;s the potential to the land and other things , almost in a eigenen .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we introduce notfallmaßnahmen to try to keep the erdtemperatur stable ?
bg : if you get to this situation , it &apos;s like you &apos;re having too much eaten , and it &apos;s a heart attack , and then what you do ? you might need a herzoperation or something .
there &apos;s a forschungsrichtung that &apos;s called geoengineering , which is nennt with different techniques to verzögern the warming , so that we had 20 or 30 years longer for zusammenzuraufen .
this is just a versicherungsmethode .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you don &apos;t want to work at all , because you &apos;re going to get lazy , so that you eat , because you know , because you know , you know , that one is going to save .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re smart , if you get the importance of this problem of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have that , if things come up faster , or that innovation , when you expect .
klimaskeptiker : do you have one or two sentences for you to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptic are in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there are negative impact to do the clouds that have to do things ?
there are very , very few things that you can tell at all , which is an opportunity in a million .
the hauptproblem here is like aids .
you make the mistakes now , and you pay a lot later .
and so , if you &apos;ve got all kinds of dringenden problems to invest in something that you have to invest in something , in something that you &apos;ve got to do , you &apos;re not necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world that the ipcc look at and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that these uncertainty should make us care .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economically , and you can also say the co2 , it &apos;s going to say that there &apos;s no co2 , i wish it was done , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the most björn argument that , if you use all of this time and energy to solve the footprint , which is , if you &apos;re using all of this time and so on , there &apos;s a dumb waste of resources to invest money while there are better things that we can do .
bg : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
underneath other things shouldn &apos;t suffer .
you get to great geldsummen , and here you can disagree with reasonable people , if you have something that is not economically , and try to fund that , for me , most of the waste .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very quickly in front of the learning curve , and i think we should try to do more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if the abstrich that you get a very high energiepreis , you can only keep the rich up .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing the lifestyle .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even lomborg thinks .
his new masche is now , &quot; why isn &apos;t the research ? &quot;
it &apos;s still going to be because of his former stories associated with the skeptiker-camp , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why he &apos;s going to get the forschungsargument .
and that &apos;s an idea that i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy how little the supported will be supported .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about all of the people here , when i say , i really hope that your wish is true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago at ted , peter skillman hired a design-wettbewerb called &quot; the marshmallow-herausforderung . &quot;
the idea is quite simple . vierer-teams must have to bauen the biggest freistehende structure with 20 spaghetti tape , about a three feet and build a marshmallow .
the marshmallow is up on top .
and , although it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s really hard , because people are pushing very fast together .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned it into a design-workshop .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops in the world with students , engineers engineers and architects , even with ctos , and there &apos;s something about this problem , what deep sensations in the nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them with you .
normally most people start to do their task on their task .
you talk about how it &apos;s going to look like , you know , you know what it &apos;s going to look like .
then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization . they draw and put spaghetti spaghetti .
they spend a lot of their time in the zusammenbau structures .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have a time before you don &apos;t have time , you take the marshmallow and you put it on the top , you get a step back and &quot; ta-da . &quot; they admire her work .
but what happens , almost , almost , is that the &quot; ta-da &quot; is going to be a &quot; uh-oh , because the weight of the marshmallows , because the whole thing is going to bend and einstürzt .
there &apos;s a series of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh than others , and among the worst they are frische .
they lie , they &apos;re cheating , they &apos;re confused and making really dürftige shapes .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more &quot; , and under the best , they &apos;re frische at the best .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us peter , they don &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is : how does this come ? why ? what about those ?
and peter says , &quot; none of the children are spent time to be gmbh of spaghetti . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in machtkämpfe .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that bwl-studenten trained to find a real plan , ok !
and then to realize it .
then what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you have no time more and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s done differently is that you start with the marshmallow and building prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that you have several times a way to repair prototypes .
konstrukteure is this kind of kind of collaboration as the core of a iterativen .
and with each trial , the kids get feedback , which works and what &apos;s not .
so the ability to work with prototypes , essential -- but we see how different teams are operating .
the average for most of them is at about 50cm , bwl-studenten , they create a little bit more , but not much , more than the adults are better than adults .
who is most successful ?
architects and engineers , happiness .
three feet is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because you understand triangles and sich-selbst-verstärkende geometric patterns are the key to build stable structures .
ceos are something about average . but here it is interesting .
you put an exekutive arm on the team , become significant better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see around and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
because they have special skills of prozessbegleitung .
they run the process , they understand it .
and that team that regelt and look at the work , the performance of the teams will dramatically improve .
spezialisierte skills and prozessfähigkeiten and their combination lead to success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical approach , you get about six , the robust structures .
i was trying to do something interesting .
i thought , we get the pokereinsatz .
so i offered a $ 10000 price of software for the winners .
what happened to this design-studenten ?
what was the result ?
this was what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anybody had built a 2,5cm high construction , he would have carried the price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high wetteinsätze have a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same student .
what happened now ?
now they understood the advantage of the design .
that &apos;s the same , bad team one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there are kinds of lessons for us , about the nature of drive and success .
you like questions : why would someone actually invest a marshmallow-challenge to create ?
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help teams , to help cars , video games and &quot; .
and what the marshmallow-challenge does is , it helps to identify them .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a shared experience , a common language , or an grundhaltung , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in you can visit marshmallowchallenge.com .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the marshmallows .
there &apos;s a schritt-für-schritt-anleitung there .
they find crazy examples of all around the world how people das the system and raffinieren .
there are also weltrekorde .
and the basale lesson , i think , is actually a verbindender sport .
it requires that we all have to focus on the task , and we think that we think we &apos;re using our thinking of how our feelings and our do , in the challenge that lies in front of us .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is everything that it needs to take us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment . &quot;
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so , as we could have a machine .
a big machine , a cool machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room needs to .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t go to the future .
and i wonder what you would choose because i &apos;ve asked my friends recently , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america addiction . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
and i &apos;m convinced you know , in some way to wunschdenken .
and i understand .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to be in the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a adventurers .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go ahead .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that has ever been on this planet , no matter how measure it is : health , wealth , mobility , declining krankheitsraten .
there was never been a time like this .
my ur-großeltern died when they were 60 .
my grandparents kept the number of 70. .
my parents are the 80 auf .
so it should be better at the beginning of my todeszahl .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child that is born in new delhi is expecting to expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox was killed billions of people on this planet .
they have shaped the demographics of the earth in a way that no war ever did .
they &apos;re gone . they are gone .
we &apos;ve got them off . stop .
in the rich world in the rich world , the millions of us are still threatened by one generation , barely .
diphterie , röteln , kinderlähmung ...
does anyone know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of the scientific method .
and from my perspective , the scientific method is to try and see if it works , if it doesn &apos;t do it , it &apos;s one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all the good news , because there &apos;s a couple of other problems , and you &apos;ve been mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements a billion people in the world every day hungry every day .
this number goes up , and it goes very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to verwüsten this world .
drinking water , urbares land , the oil , the gas : they &apos;re disappearing , it &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people , without the country that they live to rape rape .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t even destroyed .
i believe that , and no , it &apos;s not a wunschdenken .
but this is holding me up at night -- one of the things that kept me awake at night . we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as well as now .
and we &apos;ve never been able to be able to do it as well as we can today .
we &apos;re at the verge of amazing , amazing events in many areas , and yet , i really think that we &apos;d have to go back to the enlightenment , to find a time where we have progress in progress where we &apos;ve got progress on these things , in more front than now .
people are hüllen in their faith in their faith , and they can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth becomes free .
and listen , everybody has a right on their opinion ; even a right thing in their opinion .
but do you know what you don &apos;t right ?
they don &apos;t have a right on their own facts . &apos; tschuldigung , they don &apos;t .
and i took a while to figure that out .
so , about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccine for the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed at widerstand resistance , resistance to what was the most effective activity in health care in history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i do , i wrote an article and went on .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about genetically food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i wrote an article , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why they thought that molecules are going to be a random kind of a random kind of herumzuschieben in nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i went on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re rich , we &apos;re going to eat , that &apos;s okay .
but these articles made me care , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally i found out .
and that &apos;s because these fanatiker who were mad crazy at all , were not fanatiker .
these were umsichtige people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that durcheinander me .
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress in terms of progress .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re reden ironic , with small quotes , this is &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , so there are reasons , and i think we know what that is .
we have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it should not be .
you can just call a couple of names and people will understand .
chernobyl , bhopal , the challenger , vioxx , mass destruction , the us-präsidentschaftswahl 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we thought they were always right . so be skeptical .
ask the evidence , please , demand , demand evidence .
take nothing to be given .
but it &apos;s like , if you get the evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can say that that we &apos;re now in an epidemic in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story has been published , a terrible story , which is the autismus-epidemie , mumps , and brachte vaccine .
very scary .
tons of studies have been done to see if that was true .
tons of studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , england , from england , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make a difference , because we think of anecdotes what we see what we see what we see what we can see what we &apos;re really feeling .
we don &apos;t believe in a bündel of the documents that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of it was catastrophic .
disaster because of the fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the impfrate is falling down .
that &apos;s skandalös , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what happens is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do that .
because anybody here did ?
is one in the audience ever in the audience in the audience ?
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
it doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , in this country in the last year .
these are a lot of deaths by masern , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not happening here , we can be in denial , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and be messages from platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and you can do that because you can &apos;t connect the cause and connection .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same .
and this is something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he befreite us from one of the worst geißeln of humanity .
not fear , no qualen , kinderlähmung , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul offit .
he just developed a couple of other people .
it can save the lives of 400- , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul trees and talk about vaccines and says how valuable they are , and that people should just stop jammern .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
when paul talks to a public anhörung , he can &apos;t say ohne wächter .
he gets calls home , because people like to tell him that they know where their children go to school .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
take them away , return the diseases , terrible diseases , and terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we &apos;ve got rid of this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon children will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die .
what about kinderlähmung ? do we take it . why not ?
so a few weeks ago , a couple of weeks ago , and i said , i &apos;m a little bit of schrill .
nobody said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her kid against kinderlähmung . no way .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have kinderlähmung . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have a kinderlähmung in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t know , maybe this morning in lagos , someone in a plane , and they &apos;re flying in los angeles , at the moment he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , it ends up and mietet a car , and it comes to long beach beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of those fantastichen tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a lähmenden disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love it to hüllen us in lie . we love that .
did you take all your vitamins this morning ?
echinacea , a little antioxidantium that helps you on the jumps .
i know you &apos;ve done that because half the americans do that every day .
you take the stuff , and you take an alternative , and it doesn &apos;t matter how we often find that they &apos;re useless .
the data is all the time .
they make their urine . more do they do .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay for 28 billion dollars for the dark urine .
i agree with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharmaindustrie industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health care system .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely cold and seelentötend ourselves that can afford to be able to afford .
so we go away from the way , and where are we running ?
we &apos;re walking into the poor .
that &apos;s great . i love placebo-industrie .
but you know , this is a really serious issue , because stuff is crap , and we &apos;re spending billions of dollars for it .
and i have all kinds of little requisiten here .
none of them -- gingko , betrug , betrug , that i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s been .
and you know what ? when i say this , people scream and say , &quot; what does it care ? let people do what they want .
so they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because i don &apos;t care if it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the gesundheitsminister , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to accept the evidence of my experts , &quot; or any krebs-quacksalber that &apos;s going to treat his patients with kaffe-einläufen .
if you go to this way , where i believe and magic we replace science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
he was bringing 400,000 of his people around because he was that the red beete , knoblauch and zitronenöl much more effective than antiretroviral drugs we know that they can get the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of unnötiger deaths in a country that will be worse than any other person &apos;s disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they &apos;ve got them . they always have .
well , the hirnloseste epidemic , in which we are right now is this story kampf battle between the befürwortern of gentechnisch food and the bio-elite .
this is a idiotische debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every single branch , every branch , every branch , has changed by people .
you know , there was no mandarinen in paradise .
there was no cantaloupe-melonen .
there was no weihnachtsbäume . we did it all .
we did it in the last five years .
and some of them doesn &apos;t work and some of them .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can make it more specific . and of course , and of course , we can , and of course , we can do something like vitamin a in rice rice , and the stuff can help millions of people to increase millions of people .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
we reject veränderte food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m hearing all the time : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monokultur , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . we fix it .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge nahrungsproblem , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , patentkram .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes he works and sometimes the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we fear is a dead dead , and it keeps millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? genetically food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this verrottete stuff , for example .
it &apos;s something that is about half a billion people .
it &apos;s like a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it has no nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists are building all this .
and then people could eat the food and they would not be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be chez panisse , but it would be nice .
and all i can say to this is : why do we fight this ?
i mean , we ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to do genes ?
it &apos;s not about the genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insist on greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice krispies , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it will have time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re going to do that so far , we &apos;re guilty about something that we do , i believe , i think , i don &apos;t want to be guilty , very high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy worthy , and we really need to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation conversation , you might say , &quot; don &apos;t you want to still want to go into these ridiculous time time and go into the future ? &quot;
anyway . this is what i want to do .
right now , you &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can hinbewegen them where we want them , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want to .
we need to have these conversations , and we need to think , but when we go to the time machine , and we &apos;re going to go into the future , we &apos;re going to be happy to do that .
i know that we can , and as far as it is , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for a while , i &apos;m interested in the placebo-effekt . it may seem strange that a magician is interested in it , unless you look at it like , &quot; a deception that &apos;s going to be a real thing if someone &apos;s just stuck enough . &quot;
in some studies , zuckerpillen , in some studies , in some studies , in some studies , we &apos;ve shown a measurable impact , in some studies , in some studies , have a measurable effect , or a kind of ... in schmerzmanagement , for example , for instance , if the patient is just solid enough , it &apos;s a measurable effect in the body called the placebo-effekt .
a deception becomes something real , because someone perceives it .
and so we also want to understand each other , i want to show you now a basic , very simple trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has at least since the 1950s in every zauberbuch for children .
i even learned from the cub magic magic magic magic of the 1970s in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to explain it to you and explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain him .
so , look what happens .
the knife that they can study ; my hand that they can study .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my hand .
i push my sleeves back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeves disappears or out of it , i &apos;m just going to get my wrist right here .
you can see , in this way , you can &apos;t move anything . as long as i &apos;m here , nothing can go to my sleeves or get out .
and the goal is quite simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , when everything comes well , the knife will festgehalten by my naked physical magnetism .
in fact , it &apos;s in the way that i can shake it away without the knife .
nothing goes into my sleeves or comes out , no trickserei . and you can study everything .
ta-da !
now , this is a trick that i often care about little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you look closer , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you are here in the room .
he works like this .
i think knives in my hand .
i say that i &apos;m going to make my wrist , to make sure , to make sure that nothing in my sleeves disappears or coming out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i festhalte my wrist is that there &apos;s really the secret to the illusion .
now , at the moment , where i get my hand from you , so you can see from the back in the back of the way , the fingers here , my zeigefinger , just where he was , in a position where he is so ausgestreckt .
great trick ?
there &apos;s anyone sitting in the back there who had no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and if i umdrehe , the fingers changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a delusion , why you don &apos;t recognize that there &apos;s only three fingers at the bottom : because the mind and the way it &apos;s processed information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three , but it &apos;s a group .
but that &apos;s really about now , and then i open my hand .
of course it &apos;s going to be held there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick by my zeigefinger , which is there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing is , i &apos;m going to go through this movement that &apos;s hidden through this movement , the fingers is zurückbewegt .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
you can run this trick your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo-effekt ?
one year ago , i read a study that really was really blown me right .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and therefore it was an amazing thing for me .
and this is what it was : if you offer a placebo in the form of a white pill , in the form , in the form of a aspirintablette , is just a round , white pill that has an measurable effect .
but if you take the shape that you give up to you , for example , in a smaller pill , you can change and color the blue pill , and you see a letter , you can actually measure it more effective .
and that , although none of these pharmazeutische -- they &apos;re just zuckerpillen .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really made me freak out .
but it turns out that that &apos;s not all .
if you take them , you &apos;re more effective than any form of any shape .
a colored capsule that &apos;s yellow at one end and the other red is better than a white capsule .
it &apos;s also a role .
a pill is twice as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the statistics now , i &apos;m sorry .
the key thing is , but ...
... that also the dosierungen play .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo-effekt , you need to reach to a needle .
right ? a syringe with a wirkungslosen -- some milliliter of an wirkungslosen substance of a wirkungslosen substance .
it creates a very powerful picture in your head . it &apos;s much more powerful than a white pill .
this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a system .
so , the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t seem as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t seem as good as a capsule , which doesn &apos;t seem as good as the needle .
and none of them have really pharmazeutische property property . it &apos;s only our belief that makes us a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i guess something that is obviously a deception , and let it look really .
we know from the study that you have to reach to a needle when it &apos;s supposed to go to the thing .
this is an 18 hutnadel . it &apos;s very , very spitz , very spitz , and i &apos;m going to do a little bit sterilisieren .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not damians designed special meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin and take it through them , until she austritt on the other side .
if you &apos;re übel , if you fall off , i showed you a few friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s a woman who was almost powerless .
so i &apos;m going to suggest , if you very quickly , you &apos;ll look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first sensitive part here .
you can see it in the same , but also wegsehen , if you want to .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my flesh starts , the bottom part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little einstich .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you make it crazy ?
and now just a little bit of a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had at the messertrick .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yes .
i know what people think when you see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid and durchsticht itself , just to speak for a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;m going to show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people say , &quot; okay , okay . i didn &apos;t see that right . &quot;
people in the nebenräumen come in now .
so let me show you from close to you .
this is really my skin . it &apos;s not a special effect of hollywood .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can do it .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re bad , look away , don &apos;t look at it .
the people at the back , and they &apos;re going to say , &quot; well , this is pretty impressive , but if it was real , he would -- you see , here is a hole , and there it is if it was really real , it would bleed . &quot;
okay , let me give you a little blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
i usually would take a needle out now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no lesions .
but i think in this frame frame here and with the purpose of doing something real , i &apos;m going to just get the needle in there and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to face a couple of times in the next days .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward . thank you .
everyone is talking about happiness today .
i &apos;ve got a couple of people to count the number of books that have been published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and there was much more .
there &apos;s an enormous wave of interest to happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of glücks-coaching .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these tide of work , there are several cognitive people who are sort of almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly about these cognitive people .
that &apos;s true for laien who think about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just like everyone else .
the first of these would be a widerstreben , complexity .
it turns out that the word is simply not a useful word , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we could narrow it down , but in the big and all of the things that we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to think of the complicated view of what is well-being .
the second case is about experience of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s between happy to be between happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both zusammengeworfen in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the konzentrations-illusion , and that &apos;s the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affects well-being without verzerren its importance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i would like to start with an example of one of my lectures with one of my lectures , who had berichtete a story , after one of my lectures , he &apos;d heard a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and at the end of the recording , there was a fürchterliches kreischendes sound .
and then he added it , really emotional , that ruins the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it ruined was the memories of the memories .
he had the experience .
he had musik music .
they don &apos;t count , because he was a memory of a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had .
what that really tells us is that we &apos;re thinking about ourselves and thinking about other people in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s a erlebendes self that lives in the present and the present , is capable of experiencing the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the erlebende self , which the doctor anpricht -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt if i &apos;m here ? &quot;
and then there is a erinnerndes self , and the erinnernde itself itself is that the mitzählt and the story of our life , and it , and it &apos;s that the doctor where the doctor is saying , &quot; how did you feel lately lately ? &quot;
or &quot; what was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something .
these are two very different units , the erlebende self and the erinnernde themselves , and the two of them is part of the durcheinanders of happiness .
well , the erinnernde self is a storyteller .
and that really begins with a fundamental reaction on our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we &apos;re doing stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we &apos;re allowed to keep from our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who unterziehen a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds of their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who have suffered more ? &quot;
and this is a very simple question .
patient b clearly has suffered . his darmspiegelung was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a patient b had b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question , &quot; how much did those patients think she suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient was a much worse erinnrung to the darmspiegelung than patient .
the stories of the darmspiegelungen were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories are very erbaulich or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is worse than the other .
and the one that &apos;s worse is where the pain at the end was at its peak , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their darmspiegelung , and also much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse than it for a b in erinnrung .
well , this is a direct conflict between the erlebenden self and the erinnernden self .
from the point of view , b is clearly an inferior time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we &apos;ve actually been done experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s going to work , you know , you know , you know , you could just give the darmspiegelung of patient a increase by just putting the tube in there without to shake it .
that will lead to the patient , but just a little less and much less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve been able to do that the erlebende self is a bad off , and you can do that the erinnernde self is a much better off , because now you have given patient a better story about its experience .
what is a story ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that memory gives us and it &apos;s true of the stories that we invent .
so , what a story is changes are changes , significant moments and end .
so , very , very important , and in this case , the end of the end .
well , the erlebende self itself lives his life .
it &apos;s moments of erlebens , one after the other .
and you ask : what happens to those moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i mean , you know , most moments of our lives , and i mean , you know , you know , in a lifetime of 600 million of them , in a month , it &apos;s about 600,000 a month , it &apos;s about 600,000 . most of you don &apos;t leave behind .
most of them are completely ignored by the erinnernden themselves .
and yet , you kind of get the impression that you should count what these moments of erlebens is happening in our lives .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use while we are in the world .
and how we use them to be important , but it &apos;s not the story that keeps the erinnernde itself .
so we have the erinnernde self and the erlebende self , and they &apos;re really different .
the biggest difference between them is to deal with time .
from the view of the erlebenden self , if you have a vacation and the second week is just as well as the first one , then the zweiwöchige vacation is twice as good as the einwöchige vacation .
that &apos;s not how it works for the erinnernde self .
for the erinnernde self , a zweiwöchiger vacation is hardly better than the einwöchige holiday , because there is no new memories to be added .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that &apos;s a erinnerndes itself from a erlebenden self itself , time has very little influence on this story .
well , the erinnernde self makes more than remember and stories .
so , if you have a patient , that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , you say two different surgeons , and you decide how to choose what it is , the one who has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be chosen .
the erlebende itself has no voice in this choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose experience . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future as a vorausgesehene .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of erinnernden itself , and you can think of the erinnernde yourself as one thing as one thing that kind of schleppt yourself through experiences that don &apos;t need the erlebende itself .
i have the impression that if we &apos;re doing a holiday that &apos;s very often , that means we &apos;re weitestgehend by weitestgehend in the service of the erinnernden itself .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we think about our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s given to the dominance of the erinnernden itself .
and if i think about it , i think about a holiday that we &apos;ve ever done in antarctica a few years ago that i had ever had , and i think relatively often , i think about how often i think about other urlaube .
and i probably have the memories of my memories on this dreiwöchige journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
well , if i had ever opened the folder with 600 pictures , i &apos;d spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s more and a half .
there seems to be a disagreement .
now , i like a little extreme , you know , you know , you know , how little bit of your memories , but even if you make more of it , there &apos;s a real question : why do we give memories so much weight in the verlgeich to the weight that we &apos;re given ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the urlaubs , all the images will be wiped out , and you get a amnestisches drug , so you &apos;re going to remember nothing .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you would choose a vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species of the self and you &apos;ve got to think that it &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think about time , you get an answer , and if you think about memories , you could get a different answer .
why we pick the urlaube that we chose is a problem that we pick up with a choice between the two types of self .
well , the two types of self take two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one self .
so you can ask : how happy is the erlebende self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the life of the erlebenden itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re now capable of being able to get a pretty good idea of erlebenden itself over time .
if you &apos;re lucky enough to be wondering , it &apos;s a very different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted the person , when this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
anyone who doesn &apos;t distinguish these terms of happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers about well-being , and so i &apos;m a lot of researchers about well-being .
the distinction between the happiness of the self and the happiness of the erinnernden itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separat .
the gallup organization has a worldwide survey , where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started learning about the happiness of the self .
and the main lesson that we think i learned is that they are really different .
you can know how somebody &apos;s happy with his life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach them a lot about how happy he lives his life and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the connection , the correlation is about .5 .
what that means is that if you would meet someone and you would tell you , oh , dad is a zwei-meter-mann , how much would you know about its size ?
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody &apos;s going to be on a scale on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his erlebenden self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what the happiness &apos;s satisfaction .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly happy to be content with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you &apos;re lucky enough to try to maximize the two types of self , you &apos;re going to do very different things .
the implication of what i &apos;ve been saying here is that we &apos;re lucky enough to think of happiness as a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very quickly , another reason we &apos;re not clear about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things if we think about life , and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy the people in california are not going to get the correct answer .
so if you ask that question , you think that people have to be happier in california when they say , let &apos;s live in ohio .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , in climate .
well , it turns out climate isn &apos;t very important for the most important self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the nachdenkliche self that decides how happy people are .
now , because the nachdenkliche self is responsible , you can finish at the end -- some people could end up to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to the people who go to california , to become happier .
well , your erlebendes self will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think that you &apos;re happier , because if you &apos;re going to think about it , what the weather was in ohio , and you &apos;ll feel that you &apos;ve made the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we have , in the phone a couple of weeks ago , they talked to me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this gallup survey .
is that something you can share with , because you have a few minutes left now ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
i think the most interesting thing that we found in the gallup survey survey is a number that we absolutely couldn &apos;t find .
we found that in terms of happiness .
when we were looking at how emotions vary with income .
and it turns out that under one income from 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a great representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year is people unhappy , and they &apos;re getting more happy , the poorer you become .
we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw the lines .
so what happens is obviously , that money doesn &apos;t buy a erlebnis-glück , but that lack of money certainly beschafft , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the erinnernden self , you get another story .
the more money you deserve the zufriedener .
that &apos;s not for emotion .
but danny , all the american effort is about life , freedom , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people take this befund seriously , i mean , it seems to be all in the head , everything we think , for example , in terms of steuerpolitik and so on .
is there a chance of politicians that the country generally would take a befund like serious , and do politics based on politics ?
dk : you know , i think there is recognition for the role of glücksforschung in politics .
the recognition will be slowly in the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening in other countries and they &apos;re happening in other countries .
the people are saying they should think of happiness when they think about happiness .
it &apos;s going to be a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study erlebnis-glück , or if they want to study lebens-bewertung , so we have to make this discussion pretty soon .
how to improve happiness is very different depending on how you think and whether you think of the erinnernde self yourself , or whether you think about your erlebende yourself .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you &apos;re strengt to measure the erlebnis-glück of the population .
that &apos;s going to be , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistic .
now , it seems to me , that topic , or should at least be the most interesting political debate to pursue the next few years .
thank you for the invention of economics .
thank you , danny kahneman .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing it for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it just as easy to saving the world in reality as it is to save .
i have a plan for it . i want to convince more people , including them all , more time with the play greater and tollerer .
now we spend three billion hours a week with online-spielen .
some of you might think , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we desperately have to solve in the real world .
in fact , in my research at the institute of the institute for the future , is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week , not nearly enough to solve the most problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase this time dramatically .
i &apos;ve calculated that that &apos;s the time for 21 billion hours a week .
this is probably a little bit of abwegig , so again , so again , you know , when we &apos;re going to work on problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think , we need to do games online for at least 21 billion hours per week to the end of the next decade .
no , i mean , really seriously .
why ? this image looks pretty much exactly why i think that games are so vital for survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a tip of the photographers toledano toledano .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play , so he built a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classic expressions in play .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe you get some of the nuances in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also äußerste focus , quite vertieft into solving a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re playing , you see a couple of nuances here , which is the top of gezogenen eyes , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows shows surprise .
this is a player on the edge of a so-called epischen sieges .
oh , you know that . ok . so we have some players here .
a epischer victory is a result that &apos;s so very positive that you didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and if you get it , they &apos;re shocked , they &apos;re actually capable of something like this . this is a epischer victory .
that player is just a epischen victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions faces from problemlösern around the world , when we &apos;re going to get the barriers of the next century , the face of those who are looking at the rande on the edge of a epischen sieges .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;ll see this face of the real life when we face difficult problems .
i call it as the &quot; in life , &quot; i &apos;m bad , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s me , i &apos;m like , &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad .
this is a graffiti in my former heimat , california , california , where i was in my thesis , why we &apos;re better in play than in the real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think that we &apos;re not as good in reality .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that &apos;s heard .
we &apos;re doing more in spielwelten . i mean good at the relationship with motivation with doing something bedeutsames , inspired with each other .
if we &apos;re in a spielwelt , i think that many of us are going to turn into our best version , anytime , any time and immediately to be helpful to solve the problem , as long as much as it needs , it for the fehlschlag .
and in reality , when we &apos;re failing , when we hit obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel ourselves , we feel threatened . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or zynisch .
we never have , when we play games , they don &apos;t exist in games .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible to think of thinking , you couldn &apos;t just achieve everything ?
how can we transfer these feelings from play into reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which offers the ideal environment to the communal problem .
and i found a couple of things that the epic are going to be able to do in online-welten .
so first , when you get into one of these online-spiele , especially in the world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters who are willing to give you a weltrettende mission anzuvertrauen , right now .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfect at the game , right ?
so they create this .
you never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of your skills , so you have to work , but there are no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and turns out . there are always a lot of important to do .
and there are tons of employees .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to finish her epic mission mission .
so we don &apos;t have that in real life , this feeling that there are tons of staff of staff .
moreover , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard of &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + a strength &quot; or &quot; + an intelligence . &quot;
and that &apos;s not in real life .
when i leave this stage , i &apos;m not talking about one and + a crazy idea of a crazy idea , + 20 kooks idea .
i don &apos;t get in the true life .
so , the problem of kooperations-online-welten like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand on the edge of a epischen sieges that we &apos;d rather spend our time in these spielwelten .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of warcraft-spieler have spent millions of years to solve the virtual problems of azeroth .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it may sound bad .
but to see it in context , 5,93 million years ago , our first primatenvorfahren began to walk upright .
so the first is a aufrechte primate primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend now with play , it only makes sense when you hold the time on the scale of human development , what &apos;s extraordinary .
but also , because it turns out that we &apos;re using all these time to play , actually change what we &apos;re able to do .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative , very much creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that .
once you look at this interesting statistic , which was published recently from a researcher of carnegie mellon , the average young person from today in a country with a huge spielkultur spends 10,000 hours of online-spielen to the 21st .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , 10.080 hours , they &apos;re 10.080 hours for me to spend on school , from five school to high school -- if you &apos;re never missing .
so we &apos;ve got a complete parallelbildungsweg , in the young people in the same way , what it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you may have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; überflieger , &quot; read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success for 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of kognitivwissenschaft that , if we spend 10,000 hours with the mühsamen study of one subject to the 21st of a matter , we will be going to appreciate it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what we &apos;re doing as the most significant people in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are meister-spieler .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are gamers meisterhaft ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have never been able to have a gewesenes human potential .
so many people have , right now in the world that we spend at least an hour per day .
these are our meister-spieler . 500 million people who are remarkably good in &quot; something . &quot;
and the next decade we have another billion players who are remarkably good in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the spieleindustrie developed konsolen that save energy and we &apos;re working on mobilfunknetzen , rather than the breitband-internet , that players all around the world , especially in india , in india , in india .
you expect a extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is , which is what these games are doing .
here are the 4 things i found . first of all , dringlichkeits-optimismus .
ok , imagine how extreme selbstmotivierung .
dringlichkeits-optimismus is the desire to do it immediately , to do something , to master , with the belief that we have an educated hope for success .
players always believe that a epischer victory is possible , and it &apos;s worth of trying to try and the same thing .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters of social nets .
there are a lot of interesting studies that show that we might have people more , after we &apos;ve played with them , even if they defeated us miserable .
the reason is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that somebody with us has time to have the rules that we &apos;re going to have the same goal and to the spielende .
so this enables the zusammenspielen to grow from ties , trust and each other .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
glückselige productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the durchschnitts-word of warcraft-spieler 22 hours is playing a week , like teilzeitjob .
the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happy to work hard , when we &apos;re to relax or do nothing .
we know that as human beings work as human beings , when we do hard , significant work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to be part of awe of gebietender &apos;s missionen .
here &apos;s a hintergrundinformation to go back to the right light . you &apos;re familiar with the wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
the second largest wiki of the world , with almost 80,000 einträgen , is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
you &apos;ve collected more information about world of warcraft on the internet of warcraft of warcraft in every other wiki of warcraft .
they create an epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to one single outcome . players are super-mächtige , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is that they think they can change virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward castronova is a volkswissenschaftler .
his work is awesome . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in online-welten .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be less than a massenemigration virtual worlds and online-spielumgebungen . &quot;
and that from an economist . so it makes sense .
and he says ...
not like me , i &apos;m building games , i &apos;m a little bit überschwänglich .
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can reach more than in the real life .
you can employ more powerful social bonds than in the real life , and you get more feedback and rewards in play than in the real life .
so , he says it &apos;s actually completely logical that players are spending more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
i just agree , it makes sense .
but it &apos;s definitely not optimalsituation .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that 2,500 years .
there are these ancient cube , from schafsknöcheln . you know ?
in front of these fantastic spielecontrollern , there was schafsknöchel .
and that was sort of the first people developed .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the alten greek historikers herodotus , you may know this story . the story of how games were invented .
according to herodotus , games , games , more accurate , in the kingdom , invented during a famine .
now , there was such a great famine that the king of lydien decided to do a crazy idea .
people suffered . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented it , according to the herodotus , the würfelspiel and vereinbarten a national strategy , on a day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the würfelspiel , because games are so fascinating and to us with befriedigender , glückseliger productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and for herodotus , for 18 years , it survived these famine famine , by a day and played the next .
in the same way , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we &apos;re playing a games to get out of the real world .
we &apos;re going to play a game to avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real life , everything that is really satisfying , and we get what we need to take out of play .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to 18 years , famine was not better for 18 years . so the king was the king , one last würfelspiel anzusetzen .
they divided shared the kingdom in two .
they were playing a würfelspiel , and they were being able to break into a epischen adventure .
they left lydien , and they were looking for a new home . they just had so many people back to the survival of food and they were looking for the rest of the rest of the rest they could thrive .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but latest dna-beweise show that the etrusker , which , later the roman empire , the same dna as the old lydier .
so scientists have recently come to the idea that herodotus &apos; crazy story is actually true .
and geologists found an evidence of a global abkühlung that took almost 20 years to explain what famine famine could explain .
so this crazy story could vote .
you might have saved your people by playing by playing , by 18 years in games , and then they had these eingebung and then they learned so much about what they &apos;re going to do with each other civilization .
so , we can .
we &apos;ve been living since in 1994 .
this was the first strategiespiel in real time in the world of warcraft-serie . that was 16 years ago .
they were playing würfelspiele for 18 years , we &apos;ve been warcraft for 16 years .
i want to say we &apos;re ready for our own episches game .
so , they sent half their civilization to search for a new world , so i take my 21 billion spielstunden a week .
we should be übereinkommen that half that half of us spend a day with play , until we solved the real world &apos;s problems .
i know you &apos;ll ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world in games ? &quot; and that &apos;s exactly what i have dedicated to the future in the last few years .
we &apos;ve got this flag in palo alto in palo alto , it feels like we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to introduce the best possible outcome , and then people empower to make this idea into reality .
we &apos;re making epic epische siege and giving people the opportunity to reach them .
and i &apos;m going to show you just three games that i designed to try and get people epische siege to their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a online-spiel that you have to overcome a ölknappheit .
and you know , in fact , if you &apos;re in the game , you tell us where you &apos;re living , and you &apos;re in real life , but you &apos;re going to be in real life , so you &apos;re going to tell us where it &apos;s closed . and you know , and you &apos;ve got a real life , and you need to figure out how to make your real life , if it was true , if it was true , and we ask you to pull videos on , video or photographs .
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been getestet them over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change their lives because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epischen adventure and you say , &quot; we &apos;re going to go from oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going on .
find out how they would survive . most of our players have gelernten habits .
so we &apos;ve got a bigger game for the next weltrettende game , more than just ölknappheit .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; superstruct &quot; at the institute for the future .
now , the calculation of a supercomputers point is that people have only left 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global aussterbungs- sensibilisierungs-system , &quot; of course .
the call of gamers , to get on , we &apos;re almost like a &quot; jerry-bruckheimer .
you know jerry bruckheimer-filme , where it &apos;s &quot; dream-team &quot; . you have the astronauts , the scientists , the ex-sträfling , and you can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody is in the dream-team , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , health , health , security and the future of social justice .
so 8,000 players played the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when you &apos;re google &quot; superstruct . &quot;
and the last game we bring out on the third of march . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you close the game , you get from the world bank , &quot; social umgestalter , in 2010 .
we work with universities in all over sub-saharan africa and invite them to learn to learning .
we have a comic book . we &apos;ve got to understand &quot; level &quot; for regionales , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want you all to invite to share this game with young people all over the world , all around the world , especially in entwicklungsgebieten , who benefit from getting their own social social companies to save the world .
i get to end up .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we don &apos;t have the real world yet .
well , i hope you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in the real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have all these superpowers , glückselige productivity , the ability to link close tight social nets , dringlichkeits-optimismus and the desire to epischer .
i really hope that we &apos;re playing meaningful games in this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design and play with me .
in the next decade , in the next decade , i &apos;m sure at two things : that we can create every vaccine future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let the weltverändernden play games .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about a couple of months ago in writing a article for italian magazine .
i &apos;ve always got to write my synonym-wörterbuch , but i was finished with the job of text , and i realized that i had never been in my life , what the word &quot; behindert &quot; means .
i read to you the post .
&quot; , adjektiv , verstümmelt , verstümmelt , verstümmelt , verstümmelt , verstümmelt , verstümmelt , verstümmelt , verstümmelt , abgetrennt , gelähmt , gelähmt , gelähmt , gehandicapt , , aus , aus , aus , erledigt , erledigt , erledigt , erledigt , erledigt , kaputt , kaputt , ausgezählt , ausgezählt , again , whatever , are useless and weak .
antonyme : healthy , strong , powerful .
i &apos;ve got this list out loud a friend loud and had to laugh , it seemed like that , but i only came up to &quot; quit , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t stop reading and have to stop reading , first of all of these überfallartigen wortflut and the verbundenden emotional shock .
of course , this was a ausgefranstes , old synonym-wörterbuch . i just thought that the copy must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy in the early &apos; 80s when i started with elementary school , and i started to build my self outside of my family , and to shape , in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use a synonym-wörterbuch .
let me take this entry seriously , i would be born in a world that somebody like me , as a person who could be positive in any sense of living in any sense of life , but i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the opportunity and adventure i &apos;ve experienced .
and so i immediately would expect the online-ausgabe of 2009 and expect me to make a ansprechenderen contribution .
here &apos;s the aktualisierte version of this eintrags .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , i was the last two words under &quot; near antonyms &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people that we &apos;re talking about with these words .
it &apos;s the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and people around us around us .
a lot of altertümliche societies , including the greeks and the roman , have really believed that the pronunciation has a big force , because what you can do out loud is also manifestieren .
so , what do we actually want to do -- a disabled person or a powerful people ?
in fact , alone , you know , you know , you know , it would be enough to einzuschränken , you know , you einzuschränken them .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open doors ?
a person who &apos;s opened for me was my pediatrician at the a.i. dupont institute in wilmington .
he &apos;s called dr. pizzutillo . a italo-amerikaner whose name of how you can think , most americans don &apos;t tell correctly , and so he was called dr. p. .
and dr. p. was always wearing very colorful flies , and he was just like created for the work with children .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital just great -- up to my physiotherapie .
i had to do an infinite practice , with this thick , with this , in different colors , in different colors -- you know , to build my bein-muskeln , and i hated these down more than anything else . i hated her . i hated her . i hated her .
and imagine , i &apos;ve actually negotiate as a fünfjähriges kid with dr. p. , and so trying to stop these practice , natürllich without success .
and one day , he was watching me at one of my practice -- these practice were just tiring and gnadenlos -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to tear one day one day .
and if you create it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
so , of course , it was just a simple trick of dr. p. , so that i do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to get the richest five-year-old girl in the ward on the second floor , but he actually brought me to see my daily übungs-horror with new eyes , and so it became a new and vielversprechendes experience .
and i &apos;m asking myself , how much his vision of me as strong and powerful girls have shaped my self , and i could imagine that i could see myself as a nature of powerful , powerful and atlethischen .
that &apos;s just one example of many , as adults as adults , can make the imagination of a child .
but as well as you know , examples of the synonym-wörterbüchern example , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to imagine something that we would all wish to allow each one of them to see themselves as powerful people .
our language of the social changes afterwards , which in many cases were caused by a technological change .
so , of course , from the medical standpoint , of course , you can say that my legs , in the laser-chirurgie , of titan , from titan , from titan and artificial the boundaries of titan , of titan , of course , at all of the social systems of sites , people allow themselves to be an identity for their own identity , in their own way , define themselves in their own way , and orientieren to groups that they pick themselves .
so , maybe this technology change is more clearly , because ever that there was a different truth , which is that every person in society can give something completely besonderess and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to be -- it &apos;s an interesting story , because people will always ask me to tell you about widrigkeiten , and i &apos;m going to say a little bit , this sentence for me , and i &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable with thinking about the questions of people , and i think gradually i understand why .
so , of course , the idea of dealing with widrigkeiten lives of the idea that success or happiness is based on the idea of a challenge , as if my life was so successful , because my life would be so successful , because i could drop the kinds of life with a prosthetic , or as well as people can tell me with my disability .
but the truth is that we are changing . , of course , we are the challenge , whether it &apos;s physical , emotionally or even both .
and i want to suggest that this is good .
widrigkeiten are not an obstacle that we need to be able to do better with our lives .
widrigkeiten are just among our lives .
and i tend to be aware of my shadow .
sometimes i can tell that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s barely to see , but he &apos;s all the time .
and i want to do that by no way , or the impact of the kampfs of a human being .
there are widrigkeiten and challenges and challenges , and they are just real , but the question is very different , but the question is not whether we &apos;re clear with widrigkeiten or not , but how we get with it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for that , the people we love to keep schicksalsschlägen , but they also prepare to get good with it .
and we don &apos;t think of our kids , if we make them feel the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate two things : to be the medical medical fact , to be the medical fact , and the social opinion , whether i am disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and permanent disability that i had to put apart with is that the world is all the time , she could describe me with this definitions .
in our desire to protect the people who are the heart of the heart , hard truth about their medical forecast or even a prediction to the quality of life that they expect , we need to pay attention to the way that we don &apos;t make anyone who is actually disabled .
maybe this is a concept that &apos;s just looking for what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we fix it , for each one person , a larger disability .
if we don &apos;t treat a human , and not all of his forces and possibilities , and you can detect , in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to lead , another disease .
we degradieren a person who has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the patologie and focus on all the domain of the human possibilities .
but most important , it &apos;s between perception of our unzulänglichkeiten and our great erfindergeist , a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t be abwerten , or verleugnen , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , we should turn them down in the carpet , but it &apos;s about to recognize opportunities .
it may be more about to think that we don &apos;t necessarily have to get through widrigkeiten , but that we &apos;re open to hug it to put them on the schopf , to put them on the schopf , and maybe even dance with it .
and maybe we &apos;re going to make it , widrigkeiten as a natural , stimmiges and useful , and feel like it doesn &apos;t feel like that in the presence .
in this year we celebrate the 200 . the birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin has suggested , in my eyes , to something very true in the human character .
i would use it so much : not the strongest of its way , and not the intelligenteste of its way , but that can best adapt to change .
it creates creativity .
not only from darwin &apos;s work we know that the ability of people to survive and aufzublühen and aufzublühen , from the struggle of the human mind is to transform through conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest ability of people .
and maybe we don &apos;t know what wood we &apos;re cut from when we really geprüft .
it might be exactly the sense of widrigkeiten , a sense of ichs , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like that .
we can make a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see widrigkeiten as change .
widrigkeiten are a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i think , the biggest damage that we have done ourselves , is to believe that we should be normal .
frankly , who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there are common . the typical , but not the normal . and you would really know that arms , you really want to know about learning , if you really were ?
i think , rather than .
it would be great if we &apos;re going to do this paradigm of more normal versus another , or the strength to create even a little bit more dangerous , and so we can release the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their very special skills into society .
anthropolgen have found out that we &apos;ve always found people from the members of our society to be able to be useful and a contribution .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals have been older years ago , and people with severe physical injuries , and that happened because the lebenserfahrung in the überlebenskampf of these people are valuable for society .
they didn &apos;t have these people who were broken and looks useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i was going to the city in the city i grew up in the city , in a lebensmittelmarkt in this &quot; red zone , &quot; and i stood there with a scheffel tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had shorts .
and i hear how a guy behind me says , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around and see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you &apos;ll barely remember me .
when i first saw her , i was bringing her out of her mother . &quot;
oh , so that .
and then , of course , it &apos;s made click .
this was dr. kean , a man i knew only about this day of my mother &apos;s stories about this day , because i was , of course , of course , to my birthday two weeks to my birthday .
the doctor for pränatale medical imaging record was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world , at all .
and because i was born without wadenbeine , and my feet had been geboren to them , and i just got a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , he was the überbringer , that strangers had to be the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you never would walk , and never be as beweglich as other children , or you could never have an independent life , and then you just gestraft me . &quot;
i actually found that he was raised zeitungsausschnitte of my entire childhood , whether i was going to halloween my entire childhood in the second class , whether i was going to get my scholarship or one of my sportlichen siege , and he used these clips to teach his students , medizin-studenten from hahnemann medical school and the hershey medical school .
and he called this part of his kurses , the potential of the human being the potential .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough out of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of life .
and dr. kean kept telling him , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that if you don &apos;t get anything to say anything , and even if you get a little bit of support , if you get children , you can get kids a lot . &quot;
you see , dr. kean changed his thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how somebody deals with it , two different things .
and i have changed in the course of time if you had asked me about the age of time , if you had asked me about the age of meat and bones , i don &apos;t have a second gezögert .
i really wanted to be normal .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not sure .
and that &apos;s what happens because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite this experience .
and maybe this change could happen , because i &apos;ve been meeting so many people who have opened to the doors , instead of watching the doors that wanted me and wanted to give me an idea .
see , it really takes a single person to show them , how they can manifestieren their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate your own inner forces -- the human mind is so empfangsbereit -- if you create this , and you &apos;re going to open a door for someone in a critical moment , they &apos;re a very good teacher .
they &apos;re bringing them to open themselves .
the real meaning of the worts is rooted in the word &quot; educe . &quot;
it means to produce something that in one is , the potential herauszukitzeln .
again , what potential would we like to call now ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the u.k. was done one case case study , and then gymnasien was transformed into gesamtschulen .
they call this &quot; streaming trials &quot; in the u.s. we call it &quot; tracking . &quot;
students are divided to notes .
and that a student werden schwerer , getting the better teachers , etc .
so , you know , you know , over a dreimonatigen period , the note , &quot; the note &quot; very well , &quot; and they were told they were asse that they were very smart , and after those three months , they really wrote einser .
and of course , it breaks the heart to hear the heart that the umgekehrt was said that they were just enough .
and it was the same time after the three months .
but only those who were still at school -- except from the students who had the school .
the key thing about this study was that the teachers were not eingeweiht .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were just told that the einser-schüler , and they are the students with the note enough , and they have been taught to do something and treated them .
the only disability is a mind of a mind that was broken , has no hope , has no hope . he doesn &apos;t find anything more schön. of our natural , kindliche it , kindliche , and our inherent capacity of imagination .
but if we manage to support the human spirit of the human mind , hoping to hope , and other people around them to find out beautiful , curious and phantasievoll , we make our forces really a positive .
if a mind on these qualities , we can create a new reality and new daseinsformen .
so , i want to end up with a poem , which is written by a persischen poet called hafiz in the 14th century called hafiz , in the 14th century , and the poem is called the god , not the god , but the god who knows just four words , and it all the time , he always says , come on , dance with me . &quot;
come with me . thank you very much .
how would you be better than you are right now ?
suppose i said , through few changes of your genes , you could have a better memory -- more precise , more and faster .
or if you want to be more powerful , you have more power .
do they want to be more attractive and more confident ?
what would it be like to live in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who &apos;ve been on more creativity .
what would you like most ?
what would you like to have , if you could have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably as many as many as there are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to be a doctor .
if you could have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is that all einbildung ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a andauerndes theme here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you a doctor &apos;s view .
the great geneticists in the 20th century , t.g. dobzhansky , who was also a kommunikant in in the russian church , wrote an essay called &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense of any sense of evolution in evolution . &quot;
well , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the biological evolution , this would be a very good time to get the biological evolution -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can take a look at kathryn schultz &apos;s book , which is about being wrong , because nothing over the course of this talk will make sense for you .
but if you accept biological evolution , think about this : is it just about the past , or is it also about the future ?
is it for other geltend , or does it ?
this is another view on the tree of life .
in this picture , i have a bush as a center of the verzweigungen in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree , all the existing parts of those branches have been in evolutionary terms of success : they survive ; it &apos;s got its environment fitness and strength .
the human part of this busches , far at the end is , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
we collected from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees , about six or eight million years ago .
in this period of time , maybe there was 20 or 25 different spezien of hominids .
some have come and left .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130.000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re quite remote from the other parts of life , but actually for the most part , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are quite the same .
is you clear that we can pull out of it and make the mechanisms of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human insulins , which is used to treat diabetiker ?
this is not like humaninsulin ; this is the same protein that &apos;s a chemically ununterscheidbar from what comes from the pancreas .
and when we &apos;re talking about bacteria , is aware that each of us in our gut is more bacteria in our gut than cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , do you think , if antonio damasio asked for her self , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s feucht , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to get all nutrients that you could just want to do without anstrengung .
it &apos;s a really easier to bacteria , with an occasional unterbrechungen unterbrechungen of unintended , jeodch stoß .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they are important for their lives .
they &apos;re helping and they &apos;re going to keep nutrients . and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what &apos;s going to be in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionäres balance in a species ?
or are we going to be something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s take a step back at the big bang at the scale of 14 trillion billion years ago -- the earth , about four and four billion years ago -- the earth , maybe three to four billion years ago -- the first mehr-zelligen organisms , maybe as much as 800 or a billion years -- and then the human species , which shapes over the last 130.000 years .
in this huge unvollendeten symphony of the universe , life on earth is just bemessen , the animal kingdom , as a single takt , and the human life , a little notenverzierung .
we were .
this also provides the unterhaltungswert of this speech , so i hope , d ate .
well , when i was a neuling in college , i had my first biologiekurse .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with evolution , and i put something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in einzelligen organisms , each cell the cell , and all the genetic information of the cell will move into both tochterzellen .
but at the time , as mehrzelligen organisms came around , things started to change .
sexual reproduction comes into the picture .
and importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , that the genome is the genome , the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the unausweichlichkeit of the death of our bodies in evolution at the same moment is to enter as sexual reproduction .
now i have to say , if i was a college-student , i thought , okay , having sex / death , death of sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but with every year , it &apos;s been to my zunehmenden .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , in las vegas , his show his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat at his hotelzimmertür .
he opens the door .
it &apos;s a gorgeous spärlich showgirl bekleidetes .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super-sex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; he says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take soup . &quot;
i came to the realization as a doctor , that i was a goal that was different from the goal of evolution -- not necessarily a contradiction , just different .
i &apos;ve tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to rebuild the health of a disease .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about copying the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they are and i &apos;ve developed how booster rockets rockets to send the genetic fracht into the next level of the orbit to fall into the ocean .
i think we would all think of all the mood that , as he said , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get immortality through my work .
i want to do it by dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily want to be the longest life .
it &apos;s not necessarily the biggest ones , the strongest or the fastest or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution priviligiert the creatures that are best to adapt their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , and the hot steam survive otherwise , if fish were there , it would have a vacuum of gekochte fish , however , yet they &apos;ve managed to make a bewohnbare environment .
so , what happens is that when we look at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the place in evolution , and especially how we &apos;re going to go into the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a number of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reason for that would be that we &apos;ve been managed to get a bunch of the genes of genes that were otherwise rausgewählt and had been removed from the population .
and secondly , as a species of a species , we &apos;ve managed to our environment that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to us , and we &apos;re going to adapt to them .
and by the way , we walk and we mix so much that they can no longer say that isolation is necessary , for evolution , to stattzufinden .
a second possibility is that it will be a evolution of the traditional way , of course , imposed by the forces of nature .
and the argument , here would be the wheels of evolution slowly , but they &apos;re unerbittlich .
and as far as it goes , as a species as a species , it will be isolierung and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third way , a verlockende , fascinating and terrifying opportunity .
i call it neo-evolution -- the new development that isn &apos;t just of course , but it &apos;s led by us as a individuen. in the decisions we do .
now , how could that happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
so let &apos;s look at reality that people are going to make decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family .
so think if it &apos;s not only possible to choose the gender of your child , but you can also make genetic anpassungen that will cure disease and prevent disease .
what if you could do the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or schlaganfälle or schlaganfälle ?
would you not want to do these changes in their genes ?
if we vorausblicken , these kinds of changes become increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2,7 billion dollars .
the following year when it was 2004 , they were able to do the same thing for 20 million dollars in drein until four months .
today , you can take a sequence of the three billion base of the human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and in the room from about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take a long time to be the reality that &apos;s going to be the 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .
so before a week ago , the national academy of engineering for francis and willem stemmer , two scientists , who have developed the natural process of evolution developed the natural process of evolution , to work faster and to wünschenswerte proteins in a more efficient way -- which is called frances arnold evolution .
a few years ago , the lasker-preis of wissenschaftler for his research was verliehen for his research for his research for his research , a fibroblasten , and by the manipulation of only four genes , the cell induzierte to go back to a pluripotenten cell stem cell -- potentially able to be potentially able to get any cell in your body .
those changes are in coming .
the same technology that makes the human insulin produced is able to make viruses that are not just protecting themselves , but also the immunity against other viruses .
if you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in a gang , against influenza , which is grown into the cells in the cells .
can you imagine a good thing that came from ?
this is all reality , and in the future , much more possible .
so just imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if they could change the cells of their descendants ?
what if you could change the sperm and eizellen or the fresh befruchtete , you could change your children a better chance to live for a gesünderes life -- eliminating the diabetes , the risk of the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to healthier children ?
and then the analytischen technology , the same engine of science can allow the change to prevent disease , could allow us to say to adopt super-attribute , hyper-kapazitäten -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t we have the schlagfertigkeit of a ken jennings , especially if you can broaden it with the next generation of watson-maschine ?
why don &apos;t you have fast muskelfasern that are going to allow you to run faster and run longer ?
why no longer life ?
these will be unwiderstehlich .
and if we &apos;re at a place where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we will be transformed by alt-stil evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that needs in the rule of 100,000 years , and we can compress it on a thousand years , and maybe even over the next 100 years .
these are decisions with their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , to deal with them .
do we use these decisions to shape a society that is better than the more friendly ?
or will we get selectively different attributes that we have for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to form a society formen and uniformierter , or more robust and vielseitiger ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to face .
and at the deepest world , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom and the wisdom that we need to need to make these decisions ?
in the good ones like in evil , and as you might think , these decisions are going to be on us .
thank you .
now , i want you to imagine something that gives you an portable robot that gives you übermenschliche skills , or another , that helps to get up again and go up .
and at berkeley bionics , these robots call this robot exoskelette .
they &apos;re not different than something that they put in the morning , and they &apos;re going to make extra strength , and they &apos;re going to help you , for example , keep their balance .
this is actually the true verschmelzung of human and machine .
but not only do that -- together and connect with the universe and connect with the universe out there .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
to show you what we &apos;re working on now , we start to start talking about the american soldiers in the average of the american soldiers on the average of about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the request that you should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- rückenverletzungen , 30 percent of it -- chronische rückenverletzungen .
so we thought we would take this challenge and create a exoskelett that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you here now -- or human rights load carrier .
soldier : with the hulc-exoskelett , i can wear 200 pounds over verschiedenartiges terrain , a lot of hours .
your flexible design enables it to be able to go deep to kriechen and höchst movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then increase my strength and perseverance .
we &apos;re here to introduce to this device of this device of this device , this new exoskelett in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s take a look at the people , something i &apos;m passionate about .
there is 68 million people around the world in the world .
that &apos;s about one percent of all population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we often talk about a lot of young people who are in the height of their lives -- &apos; 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 40s &apos; 40s -- the fate , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , the number of themselves .
and pretty much the only option -- when it comes to a hirnschlag , or for other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so it &apos;s been over for 500 years , by the way i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a whole new chapter in the area of mobility .
so let me introduce you to elegs that amanda boxtel , which is 19 years ago , who had an rückenmarksverletzung , which has been a rückenmarksverletzung , which has been a result that she had no longer been able to run for 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our elegs .
it has sensors .
its completely non-invasiven sensors in the crutches , the signals on our onboard-computer , the signals on your back .
here &apos;s also batteriepackungen , which is motorantrieb on your hips , as well as your kniegelenken , you &apos;re moving forward in this fairly geschmeidigen and very natural blob .
i was 24 years old and in bestform , as a monströser purzelbaum as a skiabfahrt purzelbaum .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement in my beckens .
not for a long time , a doctor , and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he aus hope from my consciousness .
anpassungsfähige technologies have ever since to go back to go back to go back to go back and drive the hands .
but nothing was invented to leave me again , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change life by future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for amanda here , and all the man , but for everybody .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m chef of a nonprofit organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t bekämpfe poverty , i bekämpfe as a gehilfe of a volunteer löschzug , the fire .
well , in our city , in which volunteers , in volunteers , they have to be pretty early on the brandstelle to be mitmischen .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer volunteer brandstelle , so i had quite good opportunities to be in it .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the verantwortlichen hauptmann and figure out what our tasks would be .
when i found the hauptmann , he had just been in a very serious conversation with the hausbesitzerin , which certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , in the middle of the night , and she was in the schlafanzug , and she was sitting under a screen out of the strömenden in flames her house in flames .
the other volunteers that had arrived in front of me -- call him luther luther luther -- the hauptmann as first and was asked to go into the house and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was sprachlos .
there was some lawyer or vermögensverwalter , who could tell the rest of the rest of his life , that he could be able to save a living creature , just because he was five seconds faster than me .
well , i was the next .
der winkte me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go into the house .
you have to go up at the top of the fire , and have to get a few shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
well , not exactly what i &apos;d hoped i &apos;d hope , but i went up -- the stairs , the hallway , which goes along the real &quot; real , &quot; the real &quot; feuerwehrmännern , which at that time they were going to get out of that time , in the bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey down , where i left my erzfeind my erzfeind and the beloved dog dog .
we put our value out to the hausbesitzerin , where , not surprising , his much more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the feuerwache got a letter of the hausbesitzerin , where they bedankte for the brave use of saving her house .
and so one thing about all the measurements for kindness : somebody had taken her a few shoes .
both in my profession with robin hood as well as a volunteer fireman , and i witnessed in my nebenberuf as a volunteer and kindness at the big scale , but i also see the altruism and the muts of individuals .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look in this room in this room and see people who have either achieved a beachtenswerten success or on your way , i want to offer memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t you wait to make a difference in the lives of another , until you get your first million .
if you have something to give , you &apos;ll give it now .
use them in a suppenküche , put a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us a chance to save the lives of a person , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one .
so you put it on ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m coming back from a community that knows the secret of the fortbestands of mankind .
a place where women are running the zepter with sex with sex , and the game , and the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not burning or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their blood .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the jungle of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressivität .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of überbetont in the history of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
during the chimpanzees of big , fear of einflößenden , they &apos;re going to run the bonobo-gesellschaft of ermächtigten female .
they really came up with this , because this leads to a ausgesprochen society in the deadly force .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known under primates .
they live in the depths of the kongolesischen , and they &apos;re just hard to observation .
congo is a paradox -- an extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the scene of a violent argument that has been gefordert for decades and almost as many lives as the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that these destruction are the survival of the bonobos .
fleischhandel and the decline of baumbestandes lead to that you can &apos;t even fill a stadion with the verbliebenen bonobos -- and even there we are not safe to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a verborgenes laugh that the trees .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have häufigen , including bisexuellen sex , with wechselnden partners , and rules and rules and social angelenheiten .
i &apos;m not saying that &apos;s the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because life of the bonobos is from more than the kama sutra .
bonobos -- like people -- love playing their lives long .
play is not just kinderspiele .
for us and it &apos;s essential to the attachment of relationships and the care of the tolerance .
and we &apos;re learning and the rules of the game .
play grows and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you saw bonobos the bonobos , you see the evolutionary origins of human lachens , dance and rituals .
play is the kitt that uns us .
well , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you some unique footage from the wild .
first of all , a ballspiel on bonobo-art -- and i don &apos;t think about fussball .
so here we see a young female and males in a verfolgungsspiel .
look at what it does .
this could be the evolutionary origin of this : &quot; you put it on the eggs . &quot;
just that i think , i like it , it &apos;s not true .
yeah !
so sexspiele are common , both by bonobos bonobos as well as humans .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ideenreichtum that you get new elements into the game -- like the testicles -- and also how the game has challenges both trust as well -- while it &apos;s a lot of fun .
but the game is a formwandler .
play is a formwandler , and it can take a lot of shapes that some of them are quiet up to some of them , phantasievoll , curious -- maybe to find them again .
and i want to show you , this is fuku , a young female , and she plays with water .
i think exactly exactly how they play , and we sometimes play grenzen limitations of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s that playful curiosity that makes us explore and interact , and the unexpected of the wiring that we form is the real breeding of creativity .
this is just a little vorgeschmack on the insights that bonobos give us to our past and present .
but also , you have a secret to our future , a future where we have to adapt to rising challenges , through greater creativity and druch increased cooperation .
the secret is that the game &apos;s game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our anpassungsjoker .
in order to succeed to a unbeständige world , we need to play .
but are we going to make the best from our spieltrieb ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos , for bonobos , we don &apos;t have the lives of their teeth and claws alone .
if it &apos;s barely appropriate , maybe there &apos;s play .
and so , my primatenkameraden , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution and play together while we wiederentdecken creativity and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples , the middle 1979 , in the same day , in the same day , at the same time , every zeugt a baby -- okay .
so two couples , every zeugt a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to use too much time to imagine it , because if you think of the whole time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
just think of it for a moment .
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case , the sperm carries an y chomosom , which is on the x of the eizelle .
and in the other case , the sperm carries an x chromosome that hits x the x of the eizelle .
both of them are überlebensfähig , both light up .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
most of my activities , i &apos;ve got two hats .
i &apos;m on a hat with the story of anatomy .
i am studied historikerin , and in this case , i study people with anatomy umgingen -- meaning human body , animal bodies -- like you with körperflüssigkeiten umgingen , with körperkonzepten , you think about your body .
the other hat i carried with my work is the activist , as a patientinnenanwältin -- or , as i sometimes say , as the u.k. lawyer -- people who are the patients of doctors .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have körpertypen , the social norms .
so , for example , i worked with people who are siamesische twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with zwergenwuchs -- so people who were smaller as usual .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with intersexuellen people whose gender is -- so people who are not the average male male or female körpertypen .
and as a universal term , we can use the word intersexualität .
intersexualität comes in many different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you some examples of the possible type of geschlechtsvarianten , which are not the male or female standard .
in one case , you might have someone with a xy chromosomenbasis , and the sry gene of y leaves the protogonaden that we &apos;ve all got fötalen , growing up .
and therefore , the testicles are testosterone at the stage of testosterone .
but because this individual are missing the receptors to see the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the testosterone .
and this is called androgenrezeptor-defekt .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to that .
as a result , the body has more of the typical female trajectory .
when the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s brought up as a girl .
but it &apos;s mostly until you get puberty and growing puberty and growing their breasts and develop them , but they don &apos;t get their period , until somebody comes to get something different here .
and they make a couple of tests and find out that instead of eierstöcken and uterus , in reality , in itself , they have a y chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could keep that person in fact , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something called adrenalindrüsen in our bodies .
they are in the back part of our body .
and the nebennieren represent androgene , which are virilisierende hormones .
most of the women , as i do -- i don &apos;t know my real job -- i don &apos;t know my real chromosomenaufbau , but i think i probably have the typical -- most of the women like i actually talk about androgene .
we &apos;re producing androgen , and we &apos;re talking to androgene .
the consequence is that somebody like me actually had a brain that was exposed to more androgenen than a woman who was born with testicles and has a androgenrezeptor-defekt .
so gender is really complicated ; intersexuelle are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in one sense , they can be distributed throughout the whole range .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call from a 19 age of the age of a 19 , who was born , he had a friend , he had a friend , he had sex with his friend , living as a man , and he had just found that he had eierstöcke and he had a uterus .
he had an extreme form of an angeborenen nebennierenrindenhyperblasie .
it has xx chromosome , and in the womb , it was so deeply active that they have essentially created a male hormonumgebung .
and as a consequence , his genitalien ausgeprägt , his brain was exposed to the typischeren male part of the hormonenspektrums .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one could see anything .
and only when he became 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he &apos;s inside that the doctors that doctors found that he was inside a female female .
okay , just a quick example of a intersexualität version of intersexualität .
some people with xx chromosomes , they develop something called ovotestis , which is eierstockgewebe by hodengewebe umhüllt .
we don &apos;t know exactly why that &apos;s happening .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s zwergenwuchs or siamesische twins , be intersexuell -- surgeons often be adapted to be adapted to the norm , because this would be for their physical health of advantage .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they often are doing different kinds of surgical surgery is because they threaten our social categories .
typically , our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomische is associated with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is to be called a female identity , which is meant to be a black identity , meant to be a black person , meant to be a black person , meant to be an african anatomy in terms of their own story .
so we have this horrible awful idea .
and if we &apos;re confronted with a body , which is actually something very different to us , you know , in terms of this .
so we &apos;ve got a lot of romantic ideas in our culture .
and our nation really is based on a very , very romantic concept of individualismus .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is , if kids are born , the two people in a body are .
where i had experienced most of the time , the südafrikanische läuferin läuferin semenya last year , whose gender at the leichatlethik world conference in berlin was asked .
a lot of journalists called me to the question : &quot; what do you get to tell us if caster is semenya female semenya female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s no test that test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit nature to us is not a line between male and female , or between male and female and intersexuell , and tastächlich , we are the line , of course , of course .
so we &apos;ve got a situation where , the further our science , we need to say that these categories that we were given for stabile anatomische , which are very simple zuordnungen to create permanent identitätskategorien , much more unschärfer than we accepted .
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
it &apos;s also true of race as it turns out , which it turns out to be more complicated than that .
in our mathematics , we get into all kinds of unbequemen areas .
so , for example , in the fact , we push at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what should we start to do with the fact that we &apos;re just different from them ?
and as we push our science forward , we get increasingly into a zone of unbehagens , where we need to recognize that the simplistischen categories that we have probably had too simple .
we &apos;re looking at all sorts of different areas of human life .
one of the areas that we see in the world today , in our culture today , in today &apos;s united states , are the struggle with the beginning and the end of life .
we &apos;ve got hard conversations about what that point is going to be a body to people , so that he &apos;s a different right now than the fetal life .
we &apos;ve got very tough today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about the question of when someone is dead .
our ancestors used to have never had so hard to fight when someone was dead .
they &apos;ve got to get a feather under the nose , and if they moved , they don &apos;t bury it yet .
if it was not moving , you &apos;re buried buried .
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we &apos;re going to take people on organs and want to put them in other people .
and as a result , we get in the fight with the really difficult question , when someone &apos;s dead , and that &apos;s going to get us into a really difficult situation that we don &apos;t have as simple categories as the early categories .
now you might think that the whole collapse of categories would really make me happy .
i &apos;m politically progressiv , i verteidige people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to realize that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought it makes me .
and it &apos;s a lot of us about thinking of democracy .
so to tell you about this anspannung , i &apos;ve got to first notice that i &apos;m a big fan of the gründungsväter .
i know they were rassisiten , i know they were sexisten , but they were great .
i think they were so tapfer and strong , and so radical , what they did for all the few years to look at the schmalzige musical 1776 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what 1776 happened with the gründungsvätern .
the founding fathers were from my view of the view of the view of the sicht activists , therefore .
what she was zurückwiesen was a anatomisches concept , and they were replacing it by another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our founding fathers refused the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very vereinfachten concept of anatomy .
the ancient world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of geburtsrechts .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the idea that people who had political power had to have the political power , because of the vererbten blutlinie from the grandfather to the father to the son , and so on .
the gründungsväter wiesen turned back to this idea , and they were replacing them through a new anatomisches concept , and this concept said that all people were created by the time .
they nivellierten the field of the field , and they decided that anatomisch , the common count , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now , they did that , because they were part of a system of a system in which two things were together .
democracy grew , but at the same time , the science grew .
if you look at the story of the founding fathers , clearly many of you are very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistischen world .
they went away from explanations of explanations , and turned out , like a true concept of power , back , where the transmission is based on a very vagen concept of geburtsrecht .
they moved to a naturalistischen concept .
and if you look at the unabhängigkeitserklärung of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature of god .
you talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of them , it gave us a concept that was about anatomischen similarities .
and so they &apos;ve been prepared for the future civil rights .
they didn &apos;t think about it that way , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened years after ?
for example , women who said the wahlrecht , the concept of the founding fathers , which says that , in common , the concept of the founding fathers , the concept of the founding fathers , which says that , in common , we don &apos;t have a difference that we should not have the wahlrecht that we should have to have a full of the law of full citizenship , etc , etc . &quot;
and women are successful .
so the successful civil rights civil rights movement , where we see people like sojourner truth , who are spach , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the marschierenden line of the bürgerechtsbewegung , saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people of different skin colors that are berufen to anatomische differences , again , again .
we see the same thing in the behindertenrechtsbewegung .
of course , the problem is that , as we start looking at all the common similarities , we need to start to ask why we &apos;ve gotten certain trennungen .
well , mind , i would like to maintain certain trennungen , anatomisch , in our culture .
so , for example , i don &apos;t want to make a fish like a man .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take the anatomy away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that 5-jährige should have the right to sex or get married .
so there are some of these anatomische who make sense for me , and we think , i think .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is , and why we keep them , and whether they make sense .
so let &apos;s get back to these two creatures that are gezeugt at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both the middle 1979 in the same day .
so , imagine that one of them , maria maria , three months was born , so she &apos;s born on 1980 .
heinrich , on the other hand , it &apos;s born on the other side , so he &apos;s born on 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria was born three months of verfrüht , they get all of the rights three months ago -- the fairly einvernehmlichen sex , the right to choose the right .
heinrich has to wait for all of this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the zeitpunktes of his birth .
we find other merkwürdigkeiten on what their rights are .
heinrich , because you think he &apos;s männlich -- although i don &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s xy -- because you think he &apos;s male , he can now move into what maria maria doesn &apos;t worry about .
maria , on the other way , in all states , the same sense , the heinrich , the heinrich in all the states , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
heinrich can marry a woman in every state , but maria can get married today in a few states today .
so we have these permanent anatomischen categories in many ways that are problematic and questionable questionable .
and for me , what &apos;s the question is , what we &apos;re going to do , because our science is going to progress in the anatomy that we have to make a point where we have to admit that a democracy that is based on anatomy , it could be auseinanderfallen ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , sometimes it feels like the science is power .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture would take a kind of pragmatic attitude : &quot; well , we need to pull a line somewhere , so we &apos;re going to pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught themselves in a very strange position .
so , for example , texas at a point , texas decided to get married a point that to get married a man that you don &apos;t have a y chromosome , and to marry a woman that you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i told you about the androgenrezeptor-defekt .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he tells us in his , &quot; i have a dream . &quot;
he says we shouldn &apos;t take people to &quot; their skin color , but after the quality of their character , &quot; judge , and go beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , it sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you do people from their charaktereigenschaften ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we &apos;re going to be sure , because i have to admit that i know a series of golden retriever , which probably benefits are probably more likely than some people who i know .
i want to be dazusagen that i &apos;m likely to know that i know , you know , you know , intelligentere , more and more and more mature decisions about their sexual relationships than some 40-jährige that i know .
so how do we ask the question of the character of character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
and part of me wonder is what if the content of personality would be something that would be maschinenlesbar in the future -- that could be made visible in an fmri visible ?
do we really want to go to this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is really leaders to make thinking about questions about questions of democracy .
in our endeavor for democracy , we did really well , and i think we would make our things well in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like the case in iran , where a man who is drawn to other men with death , unless it be punished with death , because he &apos;s willing to participate in the case , where he could stay alive .
states of these kinds we don &apos;t exist .
i &apos;m happy to say that we didn &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i talked about a few years ago , who had twins a few years ago , who had had zwillinge twins to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i was telefonierte with him , and he asked him why he did these surgeries -- it was highly riskante surgeries -- was his answer , that in his country , they would be treated very bad , and so he had to do it .
and i said , &quot; well , have you moved for political asylum from a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states offer incredible opportunities to allow people to be that they are , without going to change the will .
that &apos;s why i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to finish , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like , or looked like democracy , if we had the mothers involved .
and i want to say something that is sort of radical , which is something radical , and i think that there could be different ways that there might be different kinds of insights that could be herrühren by different types of anatomy , when people apply a gruppendenken .
since years , because i &apos;ve been interested in intersexualität , i &apos;ve also been interested in research in the field of research .
and one of the things i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and operate in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from kulturübergreifenden studies is that women , on average -- not every , but on average -- they tend to be complex social relationships and the care of people who are vulnerable within the group of vulnerable to give a lot of attention .
and that &apos;s why we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i did a graduate school , when i went to graduate school , one of my favorite mine who was interested in my interest -- i looked as a feminist , i was doing it -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what is at feminism female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about aufzulösen stereotypes about gender , so that &apos;s why not a female .
but the more i thought about his question , in order to be able to be able to be an feminism .
it might mean , it could be something , on average , what women &apos;s brains are different from a male beziehungen social relationships for hochkomplexe social relationships for the schutzbedürftige .
so where the founding fathers were extremely bedacht to figure out how individuals were protected in front of the state , it &apos;s possible that , if we have more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re more an idea of a concept of not just how to protect , but how to make each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go into the future , if we need democracy to think about anatomy -- less about the individual bodies to think about what identity is about and thinking about relationships .
so , when we &apos;re trying to make a perfektere connection , we &apos;re thinking about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with outfits .
i love every opportunity to find a different kind of crazy outfit , to find crazy outfit , and i &apos;m on the last time , and on it .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of flohmärkten and in second-hand-shops .
ooh , thank you .
second-hand-shopping allows me to reduce the impact of my garderobe , and also to the environment .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually is a good purpose ; i look pretty unique , and it &apos;s going to make my personal schatzsuche .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers is yes , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i &apos;ve been packing for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does someone do with so many outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought you .
i brought seven unterhosen of unterhosen , and that &apos;s all .
unterhosen for exactly a week , all i did in my suitcase .
i have bet that i &apos;d be able to find anything i would find , if i first came up after palm springs .
and since you haven &apos;t heard of me as the woman here at ted in your underwear -- that &apos;s what i found a few things .
and i really want to show you my outfits for this week .
sounds good ?
as i do that , i &apos;m going to leave you with some of the lessons that i think you believe it or not , from those abenteuern , have learned nothing .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the shining tigers .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always be great for less than 50 dollars .
all of this kind of kind of outfit , including , including , including me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this whole week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiological impossible to be bad gelaunt if you wear hellrote pants pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you make other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation is totally überbewertet .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my life trying to try and adapt to the same time .
just be who you are .
if you surrounded with the right people , you will not only appreciate it , they &apos;ll estimate it .
wednesday : hug her inner child .
sometimes people say i saw people , i saw &apos; games , or i remember that i remember them .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think that you don &apos;t look at something well , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i got 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to wrap this up for a minute .
if you believe that it &apos;s a wonderful person in the outside , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t do anything you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for anybody here in this audience .
we should be able to rocken everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden pailleten .
and ultimately , saturday : one of my own unique to develop a unique way of developing the world is a great way to tell the world about a word without saying a word .
it &apos;s been proven to me and again , and again , if you get people in this week , just because of what i was wearing . and i had great conversations .
obviously that &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;ll give all this back .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn for this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to get these things emotionally anhaften , because in the same way , it &apos;s going to be a different kind of crazy , farbenfrohes , strahlendes , which just wait for me when i love a little bit of love in the heart .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as bildpunkt as flying bildpunkt .
this is what we call in our lab , wahrnehmbares design .
let me tell you a little bit about this .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy in italy in italy in italy , but the reason i &apos;m going to show you this is what happened in the past decades something very interesting .
so , some time ago , if you wanted a formula to run a race , you took your budget and put your money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver was good enough , they won the race .
now , if you want to win a race , there &apos;s something like this -- something like this -- something like this -- something like this -- something like this -- something like this -- something like this -- something that information is going on to the system , and then process it , and then you use this car to make this car , and we use things in real time , in real time , it &apos;s going to change information .
this would be you , in ingenieurteams , call a echtzeit-kontrollsystem .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that made out of two parts -- a spürenden part and a reagierendenteil .
what &apos;s interesting today is the echtzeit-kontrollsysteme start in our lives .
our cities have been equipped in the last few years , just equipped with networks with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to be the computer in free .
and as a computer in free , they start reacting to other ways , they &apos;ll be seen and driven .
if we herrichten cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
just by the way , i want to say that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energiekonsums -- cause 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something about cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
beyond the cities , it pulls all of this sense and power in objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition , the paola individual for moma later , during the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
now , all of our objects , our environment , begin to talk to us back .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom out there in the outside , a sensor and a sensor .
and this is transforming the interaction that we humans are out with the environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , it means that he was going to end up the hammer and took him to moses -- you can still see a little bit of a little bit of a new place -- and said , &quot; perché non parli ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
well today , our environment starts to the first time to respond to us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , to perceive and power our environment .
let &apos;s start with it .
now the first project i &apos;m going to give you is actually one of the first of our labs .
it came up and a half years ago in italy .
and what we did was to use a new kind of network , which was used around the world -- this is a mobiltelefonnetz -- it &apos;s a mobiltelefonnetz -- and anonymous and aggregierte information from this network that will be collected from the operators to understand how the city works .
summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was the fußball-weltmeisterschaft won .
some of you will remember it was being played against france , and then at the end of zidane , the kopfstoß .
and no matter , in italy , in italy .
now , look at what happened on that day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see the kolosseum , the fluß , the fluß tiber .
the morning , the game .
you see the timeline time .
early afternoon , people here and there , and they &apos;re making calls .
the game starts -- silence .
france makes a gateway . italy , a gate .
halbzeit , people make a little call , go on toilet toilet .
second halbzeit . the end of the normal .
first sample , second .
zidane , in a moment of kopfstoß .
italy wins . yeah .
now , in that night , all the night , everybody went to celebrate .
they looked at the big key .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the siegerteam and the prime minister at the same time .
and then they went down .
you see the picture of the space of space circo , where since the roman time , people are going to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the key to the end of the day .
well , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
again , another example , another example , here is not about people , but about things that we use and consume .
well today , we know everything about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that a mac computer is how they got together .
but we just know little about where things go .
so , in this project , we actually designed some little markers to track the trash as he goes through the system .
so we started with a few volunteers , which were helped us , something more than a year in seattle seattle to tag the things that they wegwarfen -- different kinds of things you can see -- things that they would throw away .
and then we have the little chips , the small brands , on the garbage and started tracking it .
here are the results we &apos;ve just got .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of ineffizienzen in the system .
we can do the same thing with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of unnützer transporte and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we throw away , not just disappears that it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw away every day .
and if we were showing people , then we can push a behavior forward .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could give you a lot more about this , and the many other wonderful things that you can be able to tell , but i want to talk to the second part of the second part that we talked at the beginning , and this is the betätigung of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in zaragoza , spain .
it started with a question of the bürgermeisters who came to us and said that spain and südeuropa have a beautiful tradition to use the public places as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to connect new technology ?
and one of the ideas that became in a arbeitskreis ermittelt was imagine , imagine these tubes , and valves , magnetventile , work that open and close .
they &apos;re doing something like a wasservorhang with bildpunkten from water .
if they fall down , they can write patterns , they can have patterns , images , text .
and you can approach it , and it &apos;s going to open up to let them open up as you can see in this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor belloch .
it loved him very much .
and we got the assignment to design a building at the eingang expo .
we called it the digital water .
the entire building was made of water .
there are no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open up and make it in .
the roof was covered with water as well .
and if it &apos;s windig , if you want to cut it down , you can even make the roof down .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , that days , if you get the roof , you get images of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t destroyed the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person who &apos;s going to ask what happens inside .
and here you see me when i was trying to test the sensors that opened the water , not get wet .
now , i should tell you what happened one night when all sensors stopped working .
but actually , it was a greater fun at that night .
all the children from zaragoza came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to open , but a building that &apos;s still silence and holes in the water , you had to jump jumping without wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , as designers , we always think about how people who are using things that we design .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and this is the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical bildpunkten , the bildpunkten of water and the projections on it .
and this is what took us to think about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine those bildpunkte could actually start flying .
imagine if you could have small helicopter that fly through the air , and every one of them , and each one of them with a little bildpunkt with wechselndem light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the one you saw earlier that moves with others , totally in synchron .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexiblen screen or an ad , like this -- a gleichmäßige formation in two dimensions .
or irregular , in three dimensions , in three dimensions , where what changes , the light is not the position of the bildpunkte .
they can play with different types .
imagine the screen could just appear in different ways or sizes , in different auflösungen .
but then the whole just could be a 3d cloud from bildpunkten , which you can see and through that they can move through that they can look at many , many , many directions .
this is what you see a real flyfire-steuerung , the herabsinkt in order to form a gleichmäßiges v .
if you turn the light on , it looks like this . so , as we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people are being run .
it could have a impulse that can have a impulse that comes from people , from the movements of people or anything .
i want to show you something about this .
we &apos;ve worked with roberto bolle , one of the best balletttänzer in the metropolitan theater theater in new york in new york and the scala in milan -- we &apos;ve taken his movements in 3d to use them as a impulse for the flyfire .
here you see roberto dancing .
on the left side , you see the bildpunkte , the different eingefangenen sensations .
it &apos;s at the same time a echtzeit-3d-scan and a bewegungsaufnahme .
so they can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we all have bildpunkte , you can play with this and play motion and play motion and play motion .
that &apos;s what we want to be able to use as a possible impulse .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is , imagine that we &apos;re going to engage with people to do something and to change the environment -- almost like that we call it , as you can do a scheunentor , but with a cloud .
imagine that everyone can give a small donation for a bildpunkt .
i think that the remarkable thing that happens over the past years , the last few years is that we are changed from a physical world to a digital world .
it has digitized everything , knowledge , and it makes it accessible through the internet .
today , we can for the first time -- and the campaign has shown this -- we can change the digital world from the digital forces of the networks to the physical world .
that can be , in our case , we &apos;re using it to design and create a symbol .
that means something built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can to ask us the next challenges -- think of climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we change the digital world from the physical world .
so the idea is , actually , we &apos;re actually going to engage the people in which they &apos;re doing things together , collective .
the cloud is back again , again , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud from bildpunkten .
it &apos;s a physical pattern in london , but it &apos;s covered in bildpunkten .
you can do make yourself and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at them at the bottom , the most important moments for olympia 2012 and other parts , and it &apos;s kind of connection to the community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something at the top they can go to , like london new berggipfel .
you can walk in .
and a kind of digital leuchtturm in the night -- but as a allerwichtigstes , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , it &apos;s very important to me .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express people are not separated by nature , and that everything is connected .
the first time i was , almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first eisberge .
i ergriff awe awe .
my heart , i was schwindelig , while i was trying to believe what i was .
the eisberge around me almost 60 feet from the water , and i just could wonder that this was a snowflake on another snowflake , a year .
eisberge are born as a calf of a glacier or by breaking out of eisschollen .
every iceberg has his own personality .
they &apos;re interacting in clear way with their environment and their experiences .
and some refuse to give up and the klammern , as the bitter end , while others don &apos;t stand up and get a lot of passion in a anfall .
if you look at a iceberg , you &apos;re easily going to be isolated , separate from alone , just as we see people often .
but the truth is far away .
so , as a iceberg melts , i have a atme atmosphere .
so during the iceberg , he &apos;s putting mineralstoffreiches drinking water , which feeds a lot of life .
i &apos;m going to go through my photographs of this eisberge , as if i was going to do portraits of my ancestors in the mind that they exist in these individual moments of this way , and never exist again .
it &apos;s not a death , if it melt ; it &apos;s not the end , it &apos;s an end of your pfades along the life cycle .
one part of the ice that i &apos;m photographiere is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last images i &apos;d like to show you is a clip i &apos;m going to show up in kekertsuatsiak in greenland .
very rare , you actually witness a rollenden iceberg .
so here you see it .
on the left side , you see a little boat .
this is about five meters long .
please look at the form of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the wasserlinie .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man stands there .
this is the average size of a grönland-eisbergs .
it reaches about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is real time .
and just like this , it shows you the iceberg a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really blessed to work through the work in some amazing projects .
but in the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was about this guy .
his name is tempt .
tempt was one of the leading graffitikünstler of the &apos; 80s .
then one day , he came back from walking and said , &quot; paps , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of it .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood up to him .
i have a company that makes design and animations , so is inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the world &apos;s world .
so we decided tony , and tony -- and to support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk to tony .
i just want to go back with him and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t communicate all the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard about a higher gesellschaftsschicht and some remarkable insurance , you can actually do that .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
does anybody see the film &apos; butterfly and taucherglocke ?
and so they communicate -- they &apos;re walking along their fingers .
i staunte , &quot; very archaisch , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need , just a check , and instead i put a check , from which i didn &apos;t know the slightest idea of how i was supposed to do it .
i &apos;m verpflichtete at the place and his father , and his father , &quot; well , my proposal is this way : tony &apos;s going to talk , we &apos;ll get a device , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can make his art again .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s carrying all this , it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i was talking about a few months later at a conference .
i met these people from grl , recorded research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on each surface , and then draw with a laserpointer that will just recognize the negative the negative .
so they go around and make kunstinstallationen like this .
they say that all the things that are shown up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the geschlechtsteilen , and then the schimpfwörter , and then the bush-verleumdungen , and the people are actually doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in her presentation .
so , i went home , and she said , &quot; well , second , if there &apos;s the technology that you can use your eyes to control things , you should be able to find a way to control a laser , so that he can make a graffiti again , that would be great . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot and forth and forth , we &apos;ve reached some things .
first , we have versicherungen the doors , and actually have a device for tempt a device that he can communicate with -- a stephen hawking-maschine .
that was incredible .
and it &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him yoda , because you talk to him , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m like , &quot; i &apos;m so unwürdig , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and we also have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children , and i moved to the garage and have these hacker and programmers and anarchisten , and anarchisten our house .
many of our friends thought that we were pretty stupid to do that , and we were zurückkämen and all the images on the walls were graffitis gewichen .
but for two weeks , we &apos;ve been programmed , we went to strandpromenade in venice , my children were involved , too , and we created this .
it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap sonnenbrille that we &apos;ve bought on the strandpromenade of venice , something kupferdraht and some things from the home and a few things .
we took a ps3-kamera , they set up to a led-licht , and now we have a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it yourself , we &apos;re putting the code for free , the software can be able to download free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely freely from constraints .
no insurance can be querstellen .
no hospital .
every paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes alone or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back in tempts room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and this is his room .
so there &apos;s all this rummel in front of the great unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks , nudelparties and durchgemachten nights , tony drew tony for the first time after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life .
we tend to be tilted to see it outside .
we &apos;ve got a projektor set on a projektor on the hospital .
and he drew back for the first time , in the beisein of his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a feeling that was on the parking lot .
we also had to deal in the parking lot , so we felt like a part of sprüher-szene .
by the end , he would send us an email with the content , &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve drawn something .
i feel that i was pushed underwater , and i got somebody down in the bottom , and my head up to my head , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
this is something like our kampfschrei .
that holds us on the shelf , and let &apos;s go forward .
and we need to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s an amazing device .
and somebody who has a künstlerisches potential potential , deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to do it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves .
it &apos;s all from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong twitterte about us and then , in december december , has honored us to be honored when one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
the coolste of this -- and this is the whole circle -- and that &apos;s all the circle -- that &apos;s the entire circle of los angeles , in the middle of los angeles .
and there will be quite the hardest representative of the straßenkunstszene present -- banksy , shepard , shepard , caws -- all these guys are going to be there .
tempt will be part of the show that &apos;s pretty wild .
so , basically , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , you can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , the computer , this microphone , the eyewriter -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i never had anything to do with augenerfassungstechnologie , but i &apos;ve just got something and i &apos;ve found with amazing people so that we could put together something on the legs .
and this question should every one of you , and it &apos;s going to be a single day where you have something that has to get done , if you &apos;re not going to do it , if you &apos;re not now , if you don &apos;t , and if not me , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably meist kinderbuchautor kinderbuchautor .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to get a scientist like this .
you can have a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever elected farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and offenbarungen .
well , an epiphany is usually something that you &apos;re found because you &apos;ve dropped it somewhere .
you &apos;re about the block , and you take it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard bollingbroke .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at the back of high school in stow , ohio where i was the klassenschwuchtel .
i was the one who &apos;s beaten every week in the jungentoilette green and blue until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using me to use the toilet in lehrerzimmer .
she tat .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and i got to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i was going to be interested in aids-organisationen .
about three or four years ago , i was given a call from this teacher at night , who said , &quot; i have to sehen you .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned to each other as adults as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come along with the man who i know , you &apos;ve found it now .
and i should mention that i have bauspeicheldrüsenkrebs , and i want you to go . &quot;
well the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew she would have to be in hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them down , and we took them , and we gave them eight , and we gave them eight .
it was something that we knew .
and just as the woman who was going to know me as adults , they wanted to get me out , they turned into a box full of asche and was placed into my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation i &apos;ve been talking about .
the revelation is that death is part of the life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved yours .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that the rest of life needs .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is so often mentioned today .
he needs the same -- he needed , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a great explosion , as you go up to 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a engine , the klack , klack , klack , klack , klack , klack , klack .
that sounds angst .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on 1d .
i was the only one who could talk to the flugbegleitern .
so i looked at them right , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve probably caught a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had already gewendet , and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later happened three things at the same time .
the pilot set up the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
it turns down the triebwerke .
imagine a geräuschloses airplane .
and then he said three words -- the emotionslosesten words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; bereitmachen to the ground . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the bordpersonal .
i could see it in your eyes , there was horror , life was at the end .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned on this day .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have this lebensplan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought to all the people i wanted to get a hand , and it didn &apos;t do , all the fences that i wanted to do , all the experiences i wanted to do and never made .
while i was thinking about it later , i realized a saying , &quot; i &apos;m collecting bad . &quot;
because if the wine is so far and the person is there , i open him .
i never want to move more in life .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and this was when we thought of the george washington bridge , so pretty much about haaresbreite -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really bereue .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i &apos;m going to get better into everything i &apos;m going to do .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my ego .
and i bedauerte the time that i wasted for bedeutungslose things , with people who mean something .
and i was thinking about the relationship with my wife , to people .
and after that , when i was thinking about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t have two years more with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have it anymore , i decide to be happy .
the third thing that i learned -- and that &apos;s the inner clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 .
you see the water .
i said , &quot; please flieg into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to do in 20 parts , how you know it from a documentary .
as we abstürzen , i had this feeling , man , dying is not enough .
almost like we &apos;re preparing for our lives for life .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and the sadness formierte really , in a thought , is that i just want one thing .
i just wish i could see my kids growing up .
so , about a month after that i went to my daughter -- erstklässler , not a lot of künstlerisches talent ...
not .
and i feiere , i &apos;m crying like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made a sense of me .
i was clear at the time when i realized that it &apos;s just about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else , is my only goal in life to be a good father .
i was given the miracle of dying on this day .
and i received another gift , which is to see the future and come back and live differently .
my call to everybody who &apos;s flying today is imagine that the same thing happens on your flight -- don &apos;t -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
what would they do to do , because they think they would be there forever ?
how would you change your relationships , and the negative energy ?
and more than anything else are you the best parents you can only be ?
thank you .
and the idea behind the stuxnet is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post in the development of nuclear weapons is the uran-anreicherungs-einrichtung in natanz .
the gray boxes you see here , these are echtzeit-kontrollsysteme .
now , if we &apos;re working to kompromittieren the systems that control and control , we can actually do a lot of problems with a centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with windows-software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we do it , an effective industry is verwendet on a laptop , which is used to be used by a wartungsingenieur that &apos;s used for this gray box box , then we &apos;re in the business .
and this is hinter behind stuxnet .
so we start with a windows-dropper .
the nutzdaten are transferiert into the gray box , damage the centrifuge and iranian kernenergie-programm in verzögert -- mission .
that &apos;s a kinderspiel , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started to stuxnet our research in six months ago , i was completely unknown , which was the point and purpose .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated , in terms of the most , very complicated part , the most interesting part , he made by thousands of zero- day- .
and it seemed like a little bit of vorzuhaben boxes boxes boxes , this echtzeit- kontrollsystemen .
the erregte our attention , and we started a labor- project that we were infected with stuxnet , and we were looking at this .
and then something weird happened .
stuxnet was like a laborratte that didn &apos;t like our cheese -- schnüffelte , but he didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we were experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i went to me that this is an gezielter attack .
gerichtet completely at a particular goal .
the dropper streift active on the gray box , if one particular configuration was discovered , even if the special program which is trying to get infected on this goal .
and if it doesn &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t do anything .
so , that really became my interest , and we started working with this , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
we could say , for example , for example , american power power , or in germany .
so we should soon find out what the goal is .
so extrahierten , and we found the angriffs- code , and we found that he &apos;s in two digital sprengköpfe -- a smaller and a larger one .
and we also noticed that they were very professional designed by people who were obviously all insider- information .
they knew all of bits and bytes they had to attack .
probably , they knew the schuhgröße of the maschinenbedieners .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already noticed that the dropper of stuxnet is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the nutzdaten are a science .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here &apos;s a clip from this angriffs- code code .
we &apos;re talking here about -- about 15,000 lines .
it looks pretty old .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code .
so what we were first looking for as the first was systemfunktions- aufrufe , because we know what they do .
and then we were looking for timern and datenstrukturen and trying to make this with the real world -- potential aim in the real world .
so we needed to share about these targets that we could prove or wrong .
so to make these theories , we call ourselves into mind that it &apos;s definitely hochgradige sabotage , it has to act a hochwertiges goal , and very likely to iran in iran , because most of the infections are reported .
now , in this area there are not several thousand goals .
basically , it goes out on the buschehr nuclear nuclear power nuclear nuclear power and urananreicherungsanlage .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all the experts for zentrifugen and power plants from our kundenstamm . &quot;
and i called them up and you know , you know , to compare to what we &apos;ve found in the code and into the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to get the little digital sprengkopf associated with the rotorsteuerung .
there is this moving there , there &apos;s a moving part of the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulated the speed of this rotors , you &apos;re actually able to crack the there , and eventually , to explode a centrifuge .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually going to make it happen and make it happen -- obviously in the attempt to try to work , so that they &apos;re not going to be able to go quickly to it .
the big digital sprengkopf -- we got a view by looking at very closely data and looking at datenstrukturen .
so , for example , the number 164 is going to be sehr out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started to make scientific literature about how these zentrifugen are being built in natanz , and found that they &apos;re being a strukturiert in what &apos;s called kaskaden , and every kaskade contains 164 zentrifugen .
so that made sense , it adapted .
and it got better .
these zentrifugen in iran are divided into 15 so-called levels .
and guess what we &apos;ve found in the angriffscode ?
an almost identical structure .
so again , this fit really well .
and this gave us great confidence for that that we studied here .
well , don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s not just like that .
these results were achieved through several weeks .
and we often ran in a sackgasse dead , and we had to neu .
but what we found that both digital sprengköpfe are actually on one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little sprengkopf takes over a kaskade , and überdreht the rotors and slowed them up and down and down the large sprengkopf , and the large ventile with six kaskaden in interaction .
so , in big and all of us , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have , in fact , what the goal is .
it &apos;s natanz , and it &apos;s just natanz .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other targets could be hit by stuxnet .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- has really gehauen me .
down there is the gray box , and on top of it , you see the zentrifugen .
now , what this thing does is that it &apos;s the forces of sensors -- so for example , from drucksensoren and vibrationssensoren -- and it &apos;s legitimen code , which is still in the attack with the wrong forces of data , running .
and in fact , this false forces data from stuxnet before .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywoodfilmen , where the verfolgungsjagd is fed the überwachungskamera with vorher aufgenommenem .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
now , the idea of this is obviously not just that maschinenbediener the maschinenbediener .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to überlisten a digital sicherheitssystem .
we need digital sicherheitssysteme there , where a human being can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so , in a power station , if you &apos;re going up too fast , you have to open up entlastungsventile within milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human maschinenführer .
so this is where we need digital sicherheitssysteme .
and if they are at risk , then really bad things can happen .
the power station can explode .
and neither the maschinenführer , the sicherheitssystem will notice .
that &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m going to say is very important now .
think about it . that attack is generisch .
he has nothing to do with zentrifugen , with urananreicherung .
so , for example , he would work as well -- in a power station or in a automobilfabrik .
it &apos;s generisch .
and you don &apos;t have to -- when the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to put the nutzdaten on a usb- stick , as we saw it in stuxnet .
you could also use ordinary wurm- technology .
you just have to spread it as much as possible .
and if you do that , you eventually get a cyber- massenvernichtungswaffe .
that &apos;s the consequence that we need to ask ourselves .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals are not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the zielreichsten environments .
we need to ask the consequences , and we &apos;re getting better to prepare .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it &apos;s been a lot of it reported that people assume that the mossad is the hauptorganisation .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yes . okay .
i think it &apos;s mossad involved , but the driving force is not israel .
and so the driving force is the cyber- superpower superpower .
there &apos;s only one , and these are the united states -- happiness , for happiness .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for having a heidenangst eingejagt . thank you ralph .
i &apos;ve spent the last couple of years where they are in situations , usually , very difficult , and at the same time .
i went to prison -- hard .
i worked in a kohlebergwerk -- dangerous .
i filmed in kriegsgebieten -- hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days of doing nothing here -- fun at the beginning , a little bit of hard in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve exposed to the most part of my career looking at fürchterlichen situations , and this is all just for trying to study the social issues that they &apos;re very compelling and interesting , and hopefully in a way to understand what they make for the audience fun and doing it .
so when i knew that i &apos;d come here to look at a tedtalk the world of branding and sponsoring , i knew i would do something a little bit different .
some of you may have heard that i had put an ad on ebay a couple of weeks ago .
i sent out a few facebook-nachrichten , some twitter-nachrichten , and i gave people the opportunity to erstehen on my tedtalk in 2011 .
so , some happy people and companies , for-profit and non-profit , had a unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never allow you to buy the namensrechte on the talk that at the time , neither a title had a lot of content , and not many evidence of what the subject would be .
so what you &apos;ve got was this : your name here presented : my tedtalk , which you don &apos;t know what the subject is going to be , and the eventually would eventually fly to the content for the ears , especially when i just left her company for their involvement .
but besides , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
this is just the arbeitstitel .
so despite that warning warning , i knew anybody could buy the namensrechte .
so if you asked me this a year , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you to say this with certainty .
but in the new project that i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve gone into some pretty horrible situations , but nothing could be prepared for me , nothing could be so hard to me , to do something so hard and as dangerous as with these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is a film about product placement , marketing and advertising , using the whole film is being funded by product placement , marketing and advertising .
and the movie will be called &quot; the greatest movie ever . &quot;
so , what happens in the greatest movie ever , is that everything from the beginning to the end , from the beginning to the end of the titelsponsor , which you can see in the movie , this is the brand x. .
now this brand , the qualcomm stadion , the staples center ...
these people are going to be connected to the film in eternity -- forever .
and so the film will look at this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a redundante person .
that was more to word .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have x as titelsponsor , but we &apos;ll make sure we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the movie .
so maybe we sell a shoe , and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever worn ...
the greatest car that you &apos;ve ever driven from &quot; the greatest movie movie sold &quot; the greatest drink that you &apos;ve ever had , &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are part of the life , actually to get them to fund the movie ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of statten .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to the end .
and i would be happy if ceg was going to help this happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how empfänglich people are going to be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective because it &apos;s got a negative konnotation -- but you know how to evolve that ?
how much money is needed to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet , but i think , but i think it &apos;s worth of a really famous brands .
who knows when the film comes out , we might look like a tribe of vollidioten .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
the answer is probably likely to be &quot; no .
but is it a difficult thing about the film , or a difficult thing about me ?
jk : both .
... so , not so optimistic .
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about that brands .
yes .
if you look at the people who you have to do it ...
there are some places that we can turn to .
put the camera out .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera , &quot; would mean that we wanted to take a hintergrundgespräch .
it turns out that it meant in fact , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do anything with your film . &quot;
and just as all of these companies disappeared , one after another .
no one wanted to do something with the movie .
i was amazed .
they wanted to have absolutely nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising is to present your product so many people as possible as many people as possible as possible .
especially in the world today , on this interface of new and old media and the zerstückelten media media -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting , that the mass of this message brings .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a fatalen mistake , and that was this .
actually , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
you see , if you &apos;re eingeben transparency , this -- this is one of the first images that appears .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free from deception and tücke , and instantly to understand , and immediately , by charakterisiert and the access to information , especially , in terms of geschäftspraktiken -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a whole amount of transparency right now .
our politicians say it , our president tells it , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes to that , it &apos;s going to be implemented .
but why ? well , transparency is angst -- like this strange bear , who still brüllt .
it &apos;s unvorhersagbar -- like this strange landstraße .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is risky ?
a whole bowl of cool food .
that &apos;s very risky .
so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell the story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a child , and my father caught me -- and he &apos;s sitting there , and he &apos;s looking at me with this look -- he would say , &quot; my son , there are three versions .
there is your version , there is my version , and there &apos;s the true version . &quot;
so , you see , with this movie , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there &apos;s only one company that was willing to help us -- and that &apos;s just because i &apos;ve known john bond , and richard kirshenbaum for years -- i realized i had to do it alone , i had to deal with the mittelsmann and right with my team to the companies .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start talking with these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , is a broad problem .
i have friends , the big , giant hollywood-filme , and i have friends who are little independent-filme like me .
and my friends , huge hollywood-filme , say that the reason their movies are so successful is that their movies that they have that they have .
and then my friends who are doing little independent-filme , &quot; well , how do we compete with these big , giant hollywood-filmen compete ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever . &quot;
so what are we going to see in the movie ?
and whenever i do that way , and whenever i open the medizinschrank , you &apos;ll see deodorant .
and every time i interviewe somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough to this interview ?
are you here ? you look a little nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so maybe you should before the interview a little bit of this . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great düfte .
either &quot; floral fusion &quot; or a &quot; paradise winds &quot; , you &apos;ll have a choice .
we &apos;re equipped to be equipped for men for women -- solid , roll-on , or a stick , whatever .
this is the kurzfassung .
now i can answer all your questions and give you a ausfühliche version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand herausforderer .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so , doing these things -- you know , people remember ban -- that &apos;s kind of , why we &apos;re interested .
what are you going to describe ban ?
ban is blank .
that &apos;s a great question .
überlegene technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone is doing under the achseln .
we talk about kühn , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really does a positive power , in contrast to a positive , geruch smell and humidity .
it keeps you fresh .
how can we hold them more fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , more fresh , three times .
these things have a positivere effect .
and this is a millionen-konzern .
what about me ? what about the druchschittstypen ?
i have to talk to the man on the street , which is like me , otto-normal-verbraucher .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really love beautiful clothes .
&apos; 80s revival hits skaterpunk , except at the waschtag .
well , what is the brand ?
unique .
i think the genre , the style i have is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of grautöne and so stuff .
but i usually have a accessoire , like sonnenbrillen , or a jewelry and such stuff .
if dan would be a brand , it would probably be a classic mercedes .
mann 2 : the brand i am , i would say , lässige fly .
women 2 : partly partly , partly , partly brooklyn-mädchen -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the schmusetyp .
i sell schmusetiere across the country around the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , verzerrten industry .
mann 4 : my brand is fedex because i were ausliefere .
mann 5 : brand gescheiteter alkoholsüchtiger .
is this ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a anwaltsmarke .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t be all the tom-marke , but i &apos;m often looking at the interface of dark glamour and lässiger fly .
and what was noticed was that i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could go into my head , someone who could really help me understand what &apos;s called the &quot; markenpersönlichkeit . &quot;
and so i found a company called olson zaltman in pittsburg .
they have companies like nestle , febreze , hallmark , helped discover these markenpersönlichkeit .
if you could do it for anything , they could also help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
that &apos;s what i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how that with your thoughts and feelings about it .
these are the people who shapes my worldview .
tell me about the world .
md : this world ? i think the world is the world that you live -- like people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live life , the work and like this .
all of these things come and starting from a place , and for me , they start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what &apos;s the relationship to the mind and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like strange things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; -phase -- what does it bring us ?
what is the machete ? what are you doing right now ?
why is it important , neuzustarten ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about you that you &apos;re not .
what else did you go through ?
do you have to be a fear . what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
eeeeee ! no , thank you !
thank you very much for your patience .
yes . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be .
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their markenpersönlichekti are two separate , but ergänzende pages pages -- the morgan spurlock-marke is an achtsame brand .
they &apos;re very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with this .
and i think some companies are going to focus on a strength , rather than both of them .
a lot of companies -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- and that &apos;s the human nature , and they &apos;re going to be afraid , and they &apos;re going to make them welcome , and they actually turn them into something positive , and this is a geschickter schachzug .
what other brands are doing ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can also see here , target , in the wii , you can get , you know , mini , you can do .
now , there are verspielte brands and achtsame brands , these things that come and go , but a verspielte , achtsame brand is a pretty strong thing .
a achtsame , verspielte brand . how is your brand ?
if someone would ask you to describe your markenidentität , your markenpersönlichkeit , how would you ?
it &apos;s a up-attribut ? are you something that brings blood into wallungen ?
or are they more like a down-attribut ?
are you something that you quiet down a little quiet , more conservative ?
up-attribute are things that are all fresh , fresh like the fresh prince , zeitgemäß , abenteuerlich , abenteuerlich , abenteuerlich , abenteuerlich , ausgefallen and agile and agile , profan , profane , magical , magical and mystisch like gandalf .
or are they more like a down-attribut ?
are they achtsam and mondän like 007 ?
are it established , traditionally , pflegend , mitfühlend , compassionately like oprah ?
are it reliable , stable , familiär , secure , bedacht , bedacht , bedacht and the way of the dalai lama or yoda ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies that were up and down-firmen , and the &quot; no , &quot; no , &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they wanted to do nothing with this film , because they didn &apos;t have any control , no control over the finished product .
but i found 17 markenpartner who were ready to do business with someone who wanted to do business , and makes us verspielt like me , and that we ended up with stories to tell stories that don &apos;t have been able to tell -- stories that usually never want to support .
they befähigten us to tell the story of the neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this film , that you &apos;re using these days today , to anzupeilen the lustzentren of the brain , both to advertising and films .
we went to sao paulo where außenwerbung had been banned .
in the entire city for five years , there &apos;s no anzeigentafel , no poster , no poster , no flyer , nothing .
and we went to school in school where companies have their way in their way schools , in all america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i could get most of the feedback , or where i had the biggest success , those are where i interacted with things .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they umgingen the mittelsmann , they umgingen the agencies , and they said that the agencies may not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artists right .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people are going to challenge for to think of our world .
and how was that for them ? what do it succeed ?
now , since the film was on the sundance film , we can look at this .
and the premiere was the first one in january , and then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- about 900 million aufrufe of this film .
it &apos;s actually only a period of course of two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film was not ausgeliefert .
it &apos;s not even online . no streaming .
it &apos;s not come out in other countries yet .
well , the film has gained a very big momentum .
and this is not bad for a project where almost every single werbeagentur we were talking about , telling her clients , the fingers of it .
what i find is that if you &apos;re taking his chance to take risks , you &apos;re taking risks in these risks .
i think when you keep people from it , you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you train his employees to avoid risks , you &apos;re prepared the whole company to get a profit .
i feel that we &apos;ve got to encourage people to go forward to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of what they might be verängstigen .
finally , we should actually welcome the fear .
we should be the bear in the cage .
if you welcome fear . you welcome the risk .
each one of them , so we say , welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than before , it gives us a little bit of honesty .
and i said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; i &apos;m going to welcome to you from my good friends of emc , who paid $ 7100 for the namensrechte for ebay .
big data is transformed for organizations around the world in large opportunities .
emc presents : &quot; hot transparency . &quot;
thank you .
well , morgan , in the name of transparency this : what &apos;s happening right now with $ 7100 ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i &apos;ve got a check in my pocket , in my pocket , on the oberorganisation of the ted-organisation , the sapling-stiftung -- a check at $ 7100 to fund my ted-auftritt in the next year .
my name is amit .
so 18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i regte to do something about museums and art , my chefin , which is also today , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of spaßiger negotiations and stories , i can tell you , 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and your access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education in common -- i don &apos;t beschwere myself -- but i had to many museums museums , and i didn &apos;t have access to this artwork .
so when i went to visit those museums , i started to learn a lot .
and as i worked on google , i tried to try to do this desire -- make art accessible -- to lead to technology .
and then we trained a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you &apos;re just going to googleartproject.com. .
you can look around these museums here .
there &apos;s the uffizi that uffizi , the hermitage , the hermitage , the rijks , van .
i actually come to one of my favorites , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you come in two ways -- very simple .
click , and wumms , you &apos;re in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you go around and amüsiert .
you want to be in the museum ?
open up the map , jump out with a click .
they &apos;re in , they want to go to the end of the gangs .
only further . a lot of fun .
through it .
thank you , but the best thing is .
so i am in front of one of my lieblingsbilder , erntearbeiter from pieter breugel in the met .
i see this pluszeichen .
when the museum gave us the picture , you click on it .
now this is one of the images .
this is all metadaten .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i &apos;m going to click it now .
this is one of the images that we created with the so-called gigapixel-technologie .
this image , for example , is about 10 billion bildpunkte , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion bildpunkte ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can be very easily in and rauszoomen .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unbezahlbar .
but then you really want to do it deep .
and so i started playing around , and it turns out there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close to the record , and i went back , slowly that these children actually beat up something .
and i worked on a little bit about a little bit , in the met with some of the met in the met , in the met with a game called squail , where a gans is beaten with a stick on a stick .
it seems to be very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned something about it .
to go really close , you can go to the rissen .
and just to give you the track of , i think that you can see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is , but again , in a second .
let &apos;s go quickly to moma , again in new york .
another lieblingsbild of mine , sternennacht .
the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the pinselstriche ?
and the only if you want to see , van gogh has created this masterpiece ?
you go in . you can really go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom in one of my lieblingsteile of this picture of this picture until i really am at a time .
this is sternennacht , probably never before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are still many other , but i &apos;m missing the time .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called the collections .
every one of them , everyone -- whether rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go ahead and get your own museum online -- all of these images , you can put your own collection .
simple , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of zoom -- you can umherzoomen .
that &apos;s the gesandten , in the nationalgallerie .
you can put it all the things , send your friends , and so a conversation about what you feel if you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , is the main thing that the most amazing things that don &apos;t get here from google .
i think it &apos;s not even from museums .
i might not say that .
they come from the artists .
and this was an experience in humility to me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to represent this digital medium of art , and it &apos;s pretty online .
that &apos;s the biggest question that i asked for recently , &quot; did you do this to replicate the experience of a museumsbesuchs ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it should add the experience .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided up into two camps .
this is the left half , the logical side , and then the right half , the intuitive side .
if we had a measure to measure the aptitute each hemisphere , we could be able to measure your brain .
for example , this is someone who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you positionieren your brain at this scale ?
some of us may have decided for one of these extremes , but i think that , for most people in the audience , your brain looks something like this -- with a high aptitute , which is at the same time in both hemisphären .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both exclusive or so forth .
you can be logically and intuitive .
and so , as one of the people , with most of the experimental experimental quantenphysikern , that need a good fraction of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good percentage of the experiments to actually carry on the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love playing with things .
so we go out and play , and we &apos;re going to start to develop , and then we start to develop our intuition there .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing at the same time can be in a place .
i mean , it can sound strange to think that a thing at the same time in two different places , but they didn &apos;t be born with this idea , they evolved .
i remember seeing a child playing on a bodenschwelle .
he was still a kleinkind and not very good at it , and he fell .
but i bet it was going to play a very valuable lesson , which is the big things that don &apos;t just leave you , and you &apos;re going to stay in a place .
and this is a great konzeptionelles model of the world , so long they don &apos;t have a teilchenphysiker .
it would be a terrible model for a teilchenphysiker , because they &apos;re not playing with bodenschwellen , but with these little strange particles .
and when they play with their particles , they &apos;re all sort of different weird things -- how they &apos;re flying directly through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
and so they were writing all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the physics of physics a few years ago ; you need to describe quantum mechanics to describe the small particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the great objects around us .
that doesn &apos;t enjoy my intuition , and maybe because i don &apos;t very often enjoy particles .
well , i &apos;ll play sometimes with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side doesn &apos;t enjoy it .
because if all of these things are made of particles , and all those particles are going to follow the rules of quantum mechanics , then not just should you all follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see a reason why it should not be .
so i would be able to feel better with all of the thing that if we could be able to show the rules of quantum mechanics .
so a few years ago , i took myself to do this .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in the quantenmechanischen superposition .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see that green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
this is where i zoom into it . we &apos;re looking at the center .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a small piece of metal , and it &apos;s shaped like a sprungbrett , and it stands over the edge .
so i made this thing on the kind of a computer chip .
i went a clean room with new siliziumscheiben , and rackerte for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this kind of a swimming pool of the geformte pool and the thing .
this thing has the ability to be the ability to be in quantenmechanischen , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m just at the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then i get other people to do all these things , and i &apos;m listening to do all these things , because i didn &apos;t want them to do it , or frankly , they verschrecke .
so quantum mechanics says that unbewegliche objects are just the same .
the mitfahrer for unbewegliche objects are not just people , but also the light that seems to them and the wind that appears to you over and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is quantenmechanisch , we had to raus out all the mitreisenden .
and then we did .
we turned out the lights off , put it into a vacuum and saugten the whole air , and it &apos;s going to almost for me to just the elevator alone , on the elevator the piece of metal , as it wanted to do .
so we &apos;ve measured the movement .
we found that it &apos;s really strange .
rather than that it &apos;s just quiet there , it &apos;s vibrierte , the way it was like this -- like this -- like a ausdehnender and together ziehender .
in which we gave him a little push , we were able to crack it at the same time , and not vibrate -- something which is only allowed in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is what truly fantastic .
what does it mean to vibrate for an object at the same time and not vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillions of atoms from atoms from atoms are still there , and at the same time they move the same atoms and down .
they just agree with precise zeitpunkten .
the rest of the time are delokalisiert .
that means that every atom is at the same time in two different places , which means that the entire piece of metal is two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth it for all this year in the clean space , because , check that , the massstabsunterschied between a single atom and this piece of metal is about just as much as the difference between the piece between the metal and you .
so if a single atom can be on two different places in two different places , the piece of metal can be two different places , why don &apos;t you ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine you &apos;re at the same time in multiple places , how would that feel ?
how would your mind deal with it that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we aufwärmten it , the light anschalteten and the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece .
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks as if all the objects at the elevator are actually just quanten objects that are gefercht in a small room .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s still deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections , with all of the things around them , literally define who they are , and this is the tiefsinnige and strange quantum quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should think we need to think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about where they live and work , you &apos;ve given the opportunity to pick up between at least one hand of different cities that are all in competition around new residents .
at the moment we are far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t even have a single city that they &apos;re going to say .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re much more value than building it .
so we could be able to see the world very simple with duzenden , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now that may be absurd to you , unless you have never thought about new cities .
but just share the construction of apartments against the cities .
imagine , half of the people who want to live in homes did this already ; they don &apos;t do yet .
you could try to extend the capacity of the existing apartments .
but you know what you &apos;d be about to be involved in these apartments and their environment to avoid the laws and their environment to avoid the beschwerden and ausbau out of the way .
so it turns out to be very hard to keep up all this .
but you could go to a whole new place to build a completely new block , assuming the laws that the laws there would support and support it .
so i suggested that governments create new surfaces that provide enough space for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
and then i found that , about the same time , about the same time , javier and octavio about the challenge of reform .
they knew that every year , about 75.000 their land , in the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and be able to do exactly the same .
now , in this place , javier javier , what happens when we put it up with a message of the american message , what happens , if we &apos;re just going to get a message in the middle of the country , there &apos;s a part of the kanadischen rules , or the united states , or the united states , you can work there , and you can do this on the surface of these messages that they have to go to canada or america ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , proscenium suffered under a major verfassungskrise .
in the next planmäßigen elections , pepe lobo won pepe lobo in a shift whose program basically promised both novelty .
he asked octavio to become stabschef .
in the meantime , i was doing a talk at tedglobal .
through improvement , try and through the study of consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter city of the charter city .
the first point is the importance of the laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t care .
we &apos;re giving up new technologies , but for the progress , it takes technology and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws for us back .
in the fall 2010 , in 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent to the tedtalk .
again , again , he showed him .
they were calling me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s give us the vorsitzenden of our country . &quot;
so we met in december sitzungssaal of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , as valuable cities , how much more valuable they are .
and i used this graph chart to show how valuable rohland is in a place like new york , and remember that one area in some cases of dollars is worth of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a point when there was a pause , he said , &quot; paul , we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk was in very simple form that a charter city is a place that is a charter city , which is the laws of the laws that determines the laws that are there and the people who provide the opportunity to decide either of these rules or not .
so i was asked by the president of honduras , who said that we need to make this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way of bringing our country forward .
i was asked to come to tegucigalpa and just once again on the fourth of january and the fifth of january .
so , i &apos;ve given another talk to you , which has a graph like this has been trying to show that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it must be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and this sketch represents the new airport , which was built in denver .
this airport alone has an area of 100 quadratkilometern .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince you , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 quadratkilometern .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
polite all applaudiert .
the faces of the audience were very serious and paying attention .
the leader of congress came up on the stage and he said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and you played the tedtalk .
and i came to the punch line that a new city gives people new possibilities .
there would be an opportunity to live in a city that would be , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also includes new opportunities for leaders .
the leaders of the government , in honduras , would benefit from partnerländern , they could benefit from their partnerländern , they could benefit from the laws of the laws for this charter , that everybody could be able to be able to get the charter .
and the realization of president lobo was that the sense of the durchsetzung that i was thinking about as a way to bring the foreign investors here and build this city , could be the equivalent for all the parties for all years , and mistrust for many years of fear and mistrust .
we &apos;ve driven in an area .
this picture is from this place .
it fasst a thousand square miles .
and shortly after that , in january 19th , you have voted for congress for a change of the constitution to have a verfassungsgemäße policy that is special entwicklungsgebiete .
in a country , that &apos;s just a strong crisis of crisis , in congress was elected for congress to a voice to a voice .
all parties , all the parties of society , supported this .
to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved by congress twice .
in february 17th , it was approved to a voice for the second time .
immediately after this choice , between the 21st and january of february , a delegation of about 30 hunduranern on the world that were most of the world that was most interested in the business of städtebaus .
the one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large , new urban center , which was built in south south korea as the urban bostons .
all you can see in this picture was built within four years , after four years after four years , after four years after four years .
the other place that was very interested in städtebau , is singapore .
it &apos;s built two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you think about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
you &apos;ve already got a baugrundstück ; you &apos;ve already consider this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already been working on a legal system that managern allows you to participate , and it will be working on a external system .
a country has already offered the supreme court , as a dish for the entgültige appeal of the system .
also städtedesigner and -bauer are very interested .
they actually get funding with one .
one thing , as you know , was understood , there &apos;s a lot of mieter .
there are a lot of businesses that would like to be in america , especially in a place with a freihandelszone , and there &apos;s a lot of people who like to live there .
around the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to live in a permanent place .
a million people are leaving latin america every year and traveling into the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to leave their families to work , and sometimes it &apos;s single mothers who have to make enough money to eat and afford clothes .
unfortunately , it &apos;s sometimes even kids who are trying to find their parents who are trying to find their parents , in some cases , in some cases , for a decade .
so what is it an idea for an idea to think about this whole new city ?
or even duzende of these cities , or hundreds of people around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to insist on that every family has a choice between several cities that are about new residents ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
my friends , i have asked to say , thanks to ted .
do you know how many decisions do you make in a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions do you meet in a typical week ?
i recently made a survey with 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that are doing is a typical american american americans on a day .
it was also a study of ceos recently , where they were watching the ceos for a week .
and these scientists just documented the different topics with which these ceo are beschäftigt , and how much time they spent making decisions that relate to topics .
and they found that an average ceo of average in the week with 139 tasks .
each of these issues was , of course , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were hit within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions needed an hour or more their time .
think of your own decisions .
you know how many decisions do you make in the nine minutes of category at the nine minutes of meeting at an hour ?
how good , do you think , are they making decisions ?
today , i want to talk about one of the greatest entscheidungsprobleme of our modern time , the entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem .
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise you , because i &apos;m blind , just if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , please , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , my first question for today : are you ready to hear something about the entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem ?
thank you .
and when i was at stanford university at stanford university , i went to this very very very exklusiven store , at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called draeger .
this business , it was almost like a vergnügungspark .
they had 250 different kinds of obst and oil , and over 500 different kinds of fruit and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we actually drink leitungswasser .
i loved to go to this business , but at a time i &apos;ve asked myself , well , how does it come out , you know ?
here &apos;s the olive towel .
they had about 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those who were locked in boxes that came from a thousand years old .
so one day i decided to visit the leader , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model work that you really offer people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up the busladungen of tourists that came every day and usually had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose marmelade for our experiment .
this is her marmeladen gang .
they had 348 different kinds of marmelade .
we set up a little verkostungsecke right at the eingang .
we &apos;ve got six different tastes , or 24 different tastes in there , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first of all , what would more people stand and try and try and try to ?
there are more people standing if it was 24 percent , about 60 percent when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then , after that , we looked at the case , in which people were like a glass of glass .
now we saw the opposite effect .
by the people who were left when they were 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of glass .
from the people who stayed there when they were six , well , we saw that 30 percent of them bought a glass of glass .
now , if you calculate it , the people bought six times a glass of glass , when they had six , when they had six , when they had six .
now , not to buy a glass of marmelade is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem is influenced us in very konsequenzreichen decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even when it comes against our own best interests .
so the subject of the day is saving financial resources .
now , i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m going to describe with gur huberman , emir kamenica , wei jang , where we spend the decisions for fast for almost a million americans of 650 plans plans plans in the entire united states .
and what we were looking at was whether the number of fondsangebote that have been able to be able to be able to be able to have a rentensparplan plan , the probability of whether more for tomorrow .
and we found that there was a correlation in fact .
so in these plans , we had about 657 plans that offered people something between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund has been offered , that , in fact , that , in fact , in fact , it was geringer .
if you look at the extremes of the extremes , the plans that offered two fund , a teilnahmerate in the &apos; 70s &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that offered almost 60 fund , the teilnahmerate now fell on the sechzigsten .
now it turns out , even if you &apos;re going to participate in your mind , if you get more possibilities , even then , it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate in the fact that the more opportunities to give them , the more avoided to choose to vote and to choose it .
the more possibilities to give them , the more they all put their money in pure geldmarktkonten .
none of these extreme decisions , belongs to the choices that someone would recommend , if you care about the future financial well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we have seen three essential consequences that provide more and more and more choice .
you move the decision on -- push them , even when it comes to their own best interest .
they make more worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to ask themselves for things they ask themselves less , even if they make an objective objective .
the main reason to do this is that we might enjoy these giant shelves full of the voller , mustard and essig and marmelade , but we actually don &apos;t in the way we can draw , and then we can pull boundaries , and then actually choose something from the fantastic offer .
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways of forschungsorten -- they can just apply them in their business .
the first thing .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true as today that less is more .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; narrow . &quot;
they &apos;re always concerned that they lose regalfläche .
but actually , in fact , we see more and more that if you &apos;re willing to be ready , and the unwichtigen gleichartigen possibilities are going to be done , well , there &apos;s a rise of sales , it &apos;s going to cost the cost , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s a verbesserung improvement .
as a proctor and gamble , the various head of head and gamble species of 26 at 15 , they had a rise of sales to 10 percent .
when the golden cat corporation sold her 10 at the least sold by the worst sold to her percent , they had a profit , a result of the two , a result of the rise of sales and the reduction of cost .
you know , the average supermakrt today gives you 45,000 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart is offers to you today .
but the neuntgrößte supermarket , the neuntgrößte supermarket in the world today is aldi , and they &apos;re just offering them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in a dose .
now in the world of sparens , i think one of the best examples that have recently been on the market , about how to the best choice , was something that david laibson has very strong , it &apos;s a program that is offered at harvard .
every single harvard employees is automatically taking a lebenszeitfond .
the ones that really want to make a choice will be offered 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to narrow it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i asked the employees is , &quot; tell me how the opportunities are different from each other .
and if their employees can &apos;t auseinanderhalten them , they can &apos;t do it . &quot;
now , before we have lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be ready to be ready to all the people in this audience in this audience to the most beautiful straße holiday of the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i &apos;d like to read you .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read her , and i would ask you , if you &apos;re willing to embrace gary &apos;s .
okay . everybody &apos;s ready to embrace gary &apos;s .
are all that ?
well , let me show you some more of it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i may have heard more hands .
good .
the fact is the fact that she had to look at the first time , when the first time had more information , when the second time , but i would make it in the second , it would be real in the second time .
because the pictures that made it for them .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of entscheidungsüberlastung , is the konkretisierung .
it &apos;s about the fact that people to understand the difference between opportunities understand what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that the consequences need to feel vivid and concrete .
why do people spend on average to 30 to 30 percent more if they use a ec-karte or a credit card than in cash ?
because we didn &apos;t really feel money .
and it turns out that if you make it that something feels a little bit more concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people to save more .
so in a study that i &apos;ve made with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero , we &apos;ve done a study with the people in ing -- employees who have been working for ing -- and these people were all in a meeting in a gathering where they signed their participation for their rentensparplan .
and during this meeting , we &apos;ve got this meeting this meeting , just like she was , we just added a little thing .
the small thing that we have was that we have was that we were asked people to think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they were saving money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation about 20 percent , and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or a rise to four percent of the amount they were willing to pay for the sparkonto .
third technology : kategorisierung .
we can do better with more categories than more than more than more choice .
here &apos;s for example , a study that we did in a zeitschriftengang .
it turns out that it turns out in the wegmans supermärkten and down in the northeast area , the number between 331 verschiedenen has been variiert by zeitschriften magazines .
but you know what ?
and when i show you 600 magazines and i &apos;m going to show you 400 magazines , and i think of them in 10 categories , and you believe that i &apos;ve given you more choices and a better auswahlerfahrung , when i had given them the 400 , if i had given them the 600 .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different schmuckauslagen .
one is called jazz , and the other is called &quot; swing . &quot;
if you think that the left display is swing and the ad on the right jazz , you &apos;re clapping in your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
if you think that the one on the left is jazz and that &apos;s on the right side of the right , you &apos;re clapping .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
and the one on the left is jazz and the right is swing , but you know what ?
this is a highly unnützes kategorisierungsschema .
the categories have to say something that doesn &apos;t have to tell the selection .
and this problem is often when you look at the long bullet points of points .
who do you really know ?
my fourth technique : assumption for complexity .
and it turns out that we can do more information with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to increase the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a german autohersteller who gives you the opportunity to konfigurieren your car completely itself .
you have to meet 62 different decisions to create your car completely .
now these decisions are different from the number of choices that offer them a decision .
autofarben , außenfarbe of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
so what i &apos;m doing now is changing the sequence of the decisions .
half of the customers is going to go from the many possibilities , 56 autofarben to the small possibilities , four gears .
the other half of customers goes from the small possibilities , four gears , to the 56 autofarben , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
what they &apos;re interested .
if you use the standardauswahl of the decision , that means that they become overwhelmed by the heisste , i &apos;m losing them .
what you find is that the people who go from the many of the many to the low auswahlmöglichkteiten , over and over and over again .
we lose them .
let &apos;s go from the little choices to the many , you stay .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing that i did is to change the order to change this information .
when i start with the simple start , i &apos;m learning like i auswähle .
even though , even even though the gears choose , nothing about my preferences in the interior says , i &apos;ll still choose to pick up .
it also versetzt me in excited about the big product that i &apos;m going to do , and so i &apos;m willing to get ready to do with interest .
let me summarize .
and i told you about four techniques , which is the problem of entscheidungsüberlastung mildern -- narrow -- they &apos;re going to make the überflüssigen alternatives alternatives ; konkretisieren -- make it real -- we can do better with more categories , less possibilities , in complexity .
each of these techniques i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help them manage the possibilities -- good for them , they can use them for themselves , good for the people they provide service .
because i think the key to the best way to the best choice is capable of being wählerisch .
and the more we &apos;re auswählen , the better we &apos;re going to be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allocca , trends-manager at youtube , i &apos;m looking at youtube-videos .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are going to be , and then that &apos;s why it &apos;s important .
we all want to be stars -- berühmtheiten , singers , comedians -- when i was young , it seemed so infinitely difficult .
but webvideos have enabled us all , or all of our creative activities , in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be on the internet to next saturday .
but on youtube , more than 48 hours of video the video per minute .
again , only a tiny percentage ever viral , and it &apos;s going to look at thousands of times and the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : tastemaker , teilnahmecommunities and the unexpected .
well , we want .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
woah !
ohhhhh , wowwww !
last year sendete bear vasquez , this video that he had in the yosemite park of his house park .
in 2010 , there was 23 million times .
this graph is what it looked like as the video became popular for the first summer .
in fact , bear didn &apos;t want a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing this , when you &apos;re yosemite high mountain bear .
he had uploaded a lot of naturvideos .
and this video was actually sent in january of january .
what &apos;s happened here ?
and there came jimmy kimmel .
jimmy kimmel sendete den den the tweet that the video was so popular .
because tastemaker like jimmy kimmel are asking us new and interesting things and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday to get down the weekend , everybody , everybody gets down , everybody , everybody , weekend , friday . you didn &apos;t have thought that we would have these conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
rebecca blacks &apos;s &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was looked at almost 200 million times .
this is what the graph looked like .
it seems like &quot; the &quot; double rainbow &quot; seems to be out of nothing .
what happened on this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
if you want to know , these other spikes are also freitage .
but what about this day , that particular friday ?
well , tosh.0 gabelte , and a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael j. theater theater was a first one who did a joke about it on twitter .
it &apos;s important is that one person or a group of tastemakers took a point of view with a big audience , and damit the process .
then this community was formed by people who shared this big insiderwitz , and began to talk about it and playing with it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 parodien of &quot; friday &quot; on youtube .
already , in the first seven days , there was a murderer for every single week .
unlike the einseitigen conversation conversation in the 20th century , the community of the community is part of the community to become part of this phenomenon -- either we &apos;re going to spread it or make something new .
&quot; nyan cat &quot; is animation and music in endlosschleife .
it &apos;s , very simple .
this year , almost 50 million times .
and if you hold that for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a dreistundenversion that has been looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats who are looking at this video .
it &apos;s important , the creativity that &apos;s in the internetkultur of the techies and geeks .
there was remixe .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole remix-gemeinde shot from the ground that made it made by a stupid joke to something that we all participate in .
today we &apos;re not just finding pleasure to something , we do .
who could have voraussehen everything ?
who would have predicted &quot; the &quot; double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black or nyan cat .
what drehbücher would be able to write in which such drinsteht ?
in a world where every minute two days of video , it can just be a unique and unexpected hervorstechen , like that .
i &apos;m not interested in , i was not very interested when i had a friend of mine , i should be looking at this great video , of a guy in new york against fahrräder .
i got a ticket , because i was not on the radweg dangers , but often there are disability that are not going to be able to drive .
because it was completely surprising and humorous , it became a casey &apos;s funny idea , and his argument five million times .
this approach is true of everything we &apos;re creative doing .
and that &apos;s all going to give us a big question ...
what does that mean ?
ohhhh .
what does that mean ?
tastemaker , creative teilnehmergemeinden , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that everyone has access and popularität in the audience .
as i said , one of those are the biggest stars -- justin bieber -- made his beginning on youtube .
nobody needs to give your ideas green .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as well as owners of our culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they don &apos;t meet the media from today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
now , how can i talk about the relationship between women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of connectedness is in a small boat in a small boat , and the amazing strength in a small boat in the chinese sea , in the life of that little girl in the life of this little girl fest and never disappeared -- this little girl , which is now living in san francisco and talks to you today ?
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzlestückchen .
imagine the first piece : a man that burn his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life of the very simple hope of oneness and freedom was stuck together .
keep him in the einmarsch of the kommunisten in saigon , as he must say that his life was a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , it &apos;s spotteten .
he went back to silence .
he died , broke through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
i had to worry that it was not for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to zerdrücken us , but we passed it .
the next puzzleteil shows shows how a boat in the early morgenrot ausläuft in sea .
my mother was 18 , when her father died -- in a arrangierten marriage , with two little girls .
for her , life had asked her a task : the flucht of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that she could fail .
after a four vierjährigen and filmreifen saga glitt , a boat on the lake , as fischerboot .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
the most afraid of pirates , rape and death .
as most of the adults on the boat , my mother was wearing a little giftflasche .
at a gefangennahme , only my sister would have my sister , and i , you know , and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the systematic tuckern of the engine , the clapping of each wave on the bug , the vast and empty horizon .
i remember the pirates that i don &apos;t remember the pirates of times , but the todesmut of the men on our boat on our boat , or on the ausfall of the engine , for six hours .
but i remember the lights in front of the ölplattform of the coast of the coast , and at the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and at the taste of the first apfels that gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple ever tasted again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we ended up in melbourne .
and the next puzzlestück is about four women in three generations , building a new life together .
we made ourselves down in footscray , one of the working , bewohnten , whose population is from immigrantenschichten .
unlike the alteingesessenen mittelklassevororten , whose existence was completely unknown to me , there was no anspruchsdenken .
the smells of ladentüren came from the rest of the world .
and the fetzen broken englischs were given between people who had one thing in common : they started neu .
my mother worked on farms , then on a line line , in a autofabrik , six days , twice .
it could somehow find the time to find english and it-qualifikationen .
we were poor .
every dollar has been given , and has been put into more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to get on for . mostly the new things that came out of the second hand .
two strümpfe for school , every one to cover the holes in the other way .
it &apos;s an schuluniform to den , because she had six years enough .
and there were these rare ones , and there were these rare , &quot; and there &apos;s wandmalereien , &quot; and there &apos;s wandmalereien , go home . &quot;
after home ?
something versteifte in me .
there was a meeting for the reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go from the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we were telling each other from our day , and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from the boat .
and it was my job to wake up every night , until her alpträume came up , so i could get it up .
she opened a computergeschäft , and then had a kosmetikerausbildung and opened a business .
and the women came with their stories of men who don &apos;t change the change , angry and unflexibel , and sorgenerfüllte children , are trapped between two worlds .
loans and donors were looking for .
centers were built up .
i lived in parallelwelten .
in one , i was the classic asian student , the unerbittliche demands of himself .
in the other way , i was involved in uncertain life , the tragic scars of violence wore , the drogenmissbrauchs and the isolierung .
but so many got the years of help .
and because of this aid , i was auserwählt in my last year as a young australierin of the year .
and i was katapultiert by a puzzlestück for the next , and the edges didn &apos;t fit .
tan le , anonymous bewohnerin of footscray , now war bewohnerin le , and social activist , who was invited to speak of places that she never heard of , and in housing , whose existence could never have imagined .
i was not familiar with the etikette .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the besteck .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to be in the routine and the comfort of the life of an unknown vororts -- an grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who were so abschlossen in her days for 20 years , by the stories of her day and einschliefen , we &apos;re still in the same bed .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old at the time when we climbed climbed the boat .
no one has been an opportunity .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; don &apos;t you what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about jugendarbeitslosigkeit and education , and the neglect of the marginalisierten and entrechteten .
and the more open i spoke , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the lebenslagen , so many of them did what they loved were living in the limits of possible .
and even though i graduated , i realized that i could not expect a career with a career .
there had to be another puzzlestück .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a outsider , a neuankömmling , new in the picture -- and not just okay , but what you have to be grateful for , maybe a gift of boots .
because dazuzugehören can be so easy to collapse in the horizons , it can mean , you &apos;re accepted the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve gone to know now enough from my bequemlichkeitsbereich to know that , yes , the world , but not like you befürchtet it .
opportunities that would not have been allowed to have been allowed .
there was one energy , a unerbittlichen optimism optimism , a strange mixtur of humility and wagnisses .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i &apos;d collected a little team of people around me , which is not &quot; a unwiderstehliche challenge .
for a year , we had no cents .
at the end of one day , i was cooking a huge physical physical soup that we shared .
we worked late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a brilliant brilliant , and we managed to get the breakthrough .
i met the decision to go to the u.s.
after just a journey .
my gut feeling again .
three months later , i went to moved and adventure .
before i abschließe the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time , the social norm , the social norm and the local was the most important person .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother moved her alone .
with 17 17 , she got the second woman who was she suggested her .
with her man , she was worried for her man , and she brought him on trial , and she was in her own case , and he was even more sensation than she won .
&quot; didn &apos;t be &quot; turned out to be unwahr .
i &apos;m in a hotel hotel hotel in sydney when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the duschtrennwand and looked at them on the other side .
i knew she was coming to pass .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in footscray , and sat around her .
we told her stories and versicherten her we were still at her .
so to midnight the monk came and said he had to close the sarg .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you don &apos;t left it . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s going through the women .
you see who we were , and how life has shaped us , we can see that the men who were maybe in our lives that would come in our lives .
it was too easy .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i think about the boat .
who would ever wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , leichtigkeit , berechtigungsanspruch .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous of every wave of trotzt , the unbeirrte of the engine , the vast horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could be able to do this , i could do it , i would do it .
also , tans mother today is in the fourth or the fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it at all photography ?
because this is , of course , a picture you can &apos;t pick up with your camera .
but i was interested in photography when i got my first digital camera , at the age of 15 years old .
i put it with my former preference predilection , but it was a little different , because at the use of the camera , the process was in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , end of the process , the process of the process of the process .
so for me , photography seemed more like to go to the right place at the right time .
i thought everybody could do that .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts with the process of the process is going on .
photos like this : a construction site along a much befahrenen road .
but it &apos;s got a unexpected twist .
and behaltet still a realistic level .
or photos like this -- dark and farbenfroh at the same time , but everyone with the shared goal to keep a realistic level .
when i say reality , i mean foto-realität .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can actually capture , but i want to leave it as well as if you could have that , in a photograph .
photos you have to think about a brief moment to find the trick .
so it &apos;s more about capture an idea of an idea than a moment .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made on a two-dimensional area .
it &apos;s not what is realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and sit together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we &apos;ve got three perfectly perfekt objects that we can all identify in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , they can do something that looks more sophisticated than if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we überlisten our brains , because our brains really simply don &apos;t make sense that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process with photos .
it &apos;s really just to combine different realities .
so the things that make a realistisch realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they &apos;re just kind of wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to obey a realistisches result .
as you can see , that &apos;s not three special images .
but , you can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
secondly , putting together the same beleuchtungsart .
and these two pictures meet these two demands -- just shot out of the same altitude and the same beleuchtungsart .
third , it &apos;s not possible to make it impossible to be able to do where the individual images start and end it together .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photograph was actually put together .
so by looking at color , contrast and light on the edges of the individual images , photographic mängel , wie colors and disorders , we &apos;ve got the limits between the different images and let them look like a single photograph , although a picture can basically contain hundreds of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that &apos;s just a landscape , and the lower part of manipulated .
but this picture is actually composed , from photos of different places .
i personally believe that it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to go into compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew i needed a couple of months to do the different places to find the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been taken on a anglerausflug .
the shore comes from another place .
the unterwasser-teil is from a quarry .
and yes , i even have the house up on the island of red umgefärbt to make the mouth look .
so , to get a realistisches outcome , it &apos;s going to be seen from me .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s a very good plan .
and then if you do a good footage , the result can be pretty beautiful and also quite realistic .
so it &apos;s all the tools there , and the only thing that we can see is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic gesundheits-projekte fail .
and i think the most important thing about this is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced on the radboud-universität was to look a haupt-zuhörer .
it &apos;s not a particularly scientifically -- you put a cup of coffee or tea , and you ask the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how are it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all -- perhaps most of the electronic gesundheits-projekte fail : because we stopped listening .
this is my wlan-waage . this is a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got a button .
and i jumped every morning .
and yes , i have a problem , as you might recognize .
i &apos;ve got my job at 95 pounds .
it works very simple : every time i get on the scale , it &apos;s also sending my data to google health .
and they &apos;re also going to be there from my allgemeinarzt , so he can see where my gewichtsproblem lies , and not just at the moment where i need kardiologische support or that i need to look at the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 follower on twitter .
so every morning , i turn on my wlan-waage and people talk to me , before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; for lunch , &quot; for lunch , &quot; for lunch . &quot;
but this is the thing that can happen , because this is the gruppenzwang , gruppenzwang to help patients , because that could be used by obesity , or it could abgewöhnen patients .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and to bring them to play any kind of play , to control their health .
next week , this is the market .
there &apos;s going to be this little blutdruck-messgerät that you &apos;re going to put on an iphone or so anschließt .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from home to be able to share it , for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , patients come into the game . they can &apos;t only take care of their own ship , but they can also help us public health care , in the face of the challenges that are in front of us , and the kostenexplosion of health , twice twice the demand , and so on .
make ways to use the things that are easy , and start to hug patients in the team .
and you can do that through these techniques , but also crowdsourcing .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we have all navigationssysteme in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all of these atms are around maastricht .
we still know one where all the gas stations are .
and clear , we can find fastfood-ketten .
but where would the next aed to help this patient ?
we have herumgefragt , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where to find the next life-saving aed in that moment .
so what did we do ? we &apos;ve done crowdsourcing in the netherlands .
we built a website and asked a menschenmasse , &quot; if you see a aed , please share with where he is , when he said , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during geschäftszeiten , of course .
and over 10,000 aeds , the netherlands have been reported .
the next step was to find the apps for it .
and we &apos;ve designed a ipad-app .
we &apos;ve developed an app for layar , realität reality to find these aeds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like maastricht , and somebody &apos;s zusammenbricht , you can use your iphone , and within the next couple of weeks , your microsoft-handy to find the next to the next couple of those who can save life .
and so today we don &apos;t want to be just as a aed4u , like the product is called , but as a aed4us .
and we want to put this on a global level .
and we ask our colleagues all over the world , from other universities , about helping us behave like knotenpunkte , to crowdsource these aeds around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and you &apos;re zusammenbricht , it &apos;s your own verwandtschaft or anyone else , you can find a aed .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies around the world are helping us in bestätigung .
these could be kurierdienste , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the gemeldete aed is still on its place .
please help us and try to make the health thing not only a little bit better , but to take the hand .
thank you .
today , i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
i work in the solartechnologie-branche .
and my little startup would want to force that we want to force ourselves by changing ...
... it &apos;s beachtung .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take it to be charged .
now -- we can just skip that -- i &apos;m just going to skip the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
solartechnologie is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a couple of years ago , i started a program to take the star in technology and get a year off , and get to work a year and work in an environment that &apos;s pretty much what they actually hate , we &apos;ve got them work in government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the friedenscorps for geeks .
we choose some fellows every year every year and we &apos;re going to work with stadtverwaltungen .
instead of sending them to the third world , we send them into rathäuser .
and they developed a great apps apps , working with urban employees .
but what you really do is to show what technology is possible today .
so you meet al .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
it looks like he looks for a date , but what he really looks like is somebody who &apos;s looking for him when he &apos;s eingeschneit , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at the brandbekämpfung when he was zugedeckt by a meter .
how did he get to look for this particular way ?
we had a team of fellows last year in boston , the code for america for america .
they were in february , and it &apos;s got a lot of geschneit last february .
and they found that the city never saw these hydranten .
but one particular fellow , a man named erik michaels-ober , even another one , and that was that the people are free the sidewalks free , right in front of these parts .
so he did what every good developers would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire fire .
you stimmst to him , when it &apos;s schneit .
if you &apos;re doing that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it off .
so there &apos;s a nice little game game .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest apps that have written the fellows in the last year .
but she does something no other regierungstechnologie .
it &apos;s rapidly spreading .
there &apos;s this guy in the city of the city of the city , who has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but to adopt the citizen &apos;s citizens .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami-sirenen work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to test them .
and then he decided to use seattle to use the app to get the citizens to clean up the verstopften .
and chicago has just introduced them to the people who freischaufeln the buergersteige when it &apos;s schneit .
we now know nine cities that plan to use this app .
and it has verbreitet reibungslos , organic , of course .
if you know something about regierungstechnologie , you know it doesn &apos;t work that way .
the beschaffung of software is usually a few years .
we had a team that worked on a project last year in boston , for three people a half months .
it was about a way to find out the parents who can find out the right public schools for their children .
we told us that if it was about the normal channels that would have taken over two years , and it cost about two million dollars .
and that &apos;s still nothing .
there &apos;s a project in the california now , which has paid two billion dollars before , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading from selbt , is a kind of shot in front of the bug .
it shows how the government could work better -- no longer like a private company , how many people think she should .
and not even like a technik-unternehmen , but more like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , it is that it represents a new generation , which is the problem of government -- not as the problem of a verknöcherten institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we are very good in collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people making the tools that we need to make things effectively together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fellows , there are hundreds of people in the entire country to get up and write every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they fix them .
and these people know something we &apos;re lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you &apos;re all about your feelings about politics and all the other things that we really upset about , government is government , in the core , in the words of tim o reilly , &quot; what we do in common that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people gave up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i ask you that you that , because things are changing .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government eventually schöpft their power -- erinner you -- &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it will affect how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
and like a lot of people , i thought that the government is mostly about choosing people in a office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s mostly communities in order to beutelratten .
this is the call call service and information .
you usually come out when you get out of your city .
and if you &apos;ve got to have a chance to work in your städtisches center center , as part of the program , like our fellow scott silverman as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re going to see that the people , the government for many different problems , including that there &apos;s a beutelratte in your house .
so scott gets this anfruf .
he type &quot; beutelratte &quot; into the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the tierfänger .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is abhaut ? &quot;
and that worked . a round of applause .
but it wasn &apos;t the end of the beutelratten .
it &apos;s not just a call call .
it has an app , a web- and handy-app , called citizens connect .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work very smart people in the office of the new urban mechanics in boston .
one day -- that &apos;s an actual report -- it came in , &quot; beutelratte in my mülltonne . can &apos;t tell whether it &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; citizens connect is different . &quot;
scott unterhielt from man to man .
but on &quot; citizens connect &quot; is all public , so anyone can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next thing we got was , &quot; i went over there , found the mülltonne behind the house .
beutelratte ? yes ? yap ?
turned the mülltonne on the side . went home .
good night , cute beutelratte . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital problem .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is getting into this crowdsourcing .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m going to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government was played a central role .
it connected these two people .
and you would have been able to connect them with government , if they were needed , but a neighbor is a far better and billigere alternative to government services .
if a neighbor is helping the other , we strengths our communities .
call out the tierfänger , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution for the system is for the system .
how often do we choose a political leader -- and sometimes we lean back a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we lean back and expect that the government , our values and needs our needs , and then not much changed ?
this is because the government like a further ocean is and politics are the top 15cm .
and what &apos;s underneath that is what we call bureaucracy .
and we &apos;re using this word with these contempt .
but it &apos;s the contempt that we own , and we &apos;re paying for to be something that we have to do , which is working against us , something else , and then we entmachten ourselves .
people seem sexy to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the actual regierungsarbeit is happening .
we need to be about the machinery of government .
so the occupythesec-bewegung did it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a more concerned citizen that has written a very detailed 325-seitigen report , which is an answer to the sec-memo of the gesetzesvorlage .
it &apos;s not politically active , which is bürokratisch active .
well , for those of us who have given government , it &apos;s time that we think about it , about the world that we want to leave our children .
you &apos;ve got to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to ask .
do we really believe that we have to reach what we need to do without improving an institution that in the name of us all act ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of government fundamentally umzudeuten in a way that can actually achieve something by stärkt society .
and there &apos;s one generation that grew up the mitdem internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to just build the really systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up to see her voice for granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this struggle that we all fight , about who can speak ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
they can make their opinion , in every channel every time , and they do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care so much about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the work of government .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
it could be a fire called a fire to jäten , a mülleimer mülleimer .
and sure , we would have been able to have these hydranten out of all the time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers the government who receive taxes and receive performance .
we are more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all been here for you : if it &apos;s about the big , important things that we have to do together , all together , we &apos;re going to be just a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
so , my role in how wonderful the new technologies that are going to be , and i thought , because i &apos;m among friends , i &apos;m going to tell you what i really think , and also trying to understand what &apos;s going on here , with these incredible sprüngen on the front of that quickly , that we can hardly keep up with it .
i &apos;m going to start to show you just a single boring slide .
... maybe you could just show the slide .
this is a slide that i &apos;ve chosen from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , it &apos;s actually about the general form .
this slide shows a data from an analysis about the performance of risc processors compared to the performance of an area of an area of an area .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like , how many others , which we find often in our field , is a kind of a semi-logarithmischen curve .
in other words , every step here corresponds to a potency in the leistungsskala .
and this is a novelty that we need to use this type of scale on semi-logarithmischen curves in the field of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
so , if you could turn the light back again .
even a little bit better , because i &apos;m going to draw something on paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in the technology on semi-logarithmischen curves ?
the reason is , if i could draw it on a normal curve , which is , if i &apos;m going to draw it on a normal curve , the zeitachse of a way , and this is a common measure of the technology that i want to represent with a graph , then the graph becomes silly .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record a different technology , let &apos;s say a transporttechnologie , then it would be a very unvernünftig scale , in the form of a flat line .
but if something like this , it changes the qualitativen conditions .
so , if the transporttechnologie went to the mikroprozessor-technologie , then we could get übermorgen into a taxi , and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but it &apos;s not so fast .
there was never before in the history of technologie-entwicklung , this kind of rekursivem growth of growth , by which the scale the scale is increased .
so the question i &apos;m going to ask you about is , if you look at this exponential exponential , you can see , you don &apos;t go forever forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything lasts forever as soon as fast as now .
there are two options .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic s-kurve like here to get something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
it &apos;s about it .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
it &apos;s like that , it means that we are right now in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world to a new kind of world .
so the question i &apos;m going to ask you , and i &apos;ll often ask myself , is how this new world will be ?
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing , when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was still a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we &apos;ve got a conference where people talk about the future , and you find that the future is still the year 2000 .
more than we don &apos;t go .
so in other words , the future is since a year since i &apos;ve been in the world every year .
i think the reason is that we realize that something is happening .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we know that there &apos;s just no sense of trying to get 30 or 50 years to look at the future , because everything will be so different is that a simple hochrechnung of what we don &apos;t make any sense .
now i want to talk about what that might be , this transition in which we are right now .
so to do this first , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really don &apos;t do with technology or computers .
because i think to understand this really , we have to take a step back and look at the thing on a longer zeitskala .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at on the zeitskala of life on earth .
i think the picture makes sense , if you split it up in some milliarden-schritte .
so let &apos;s go back and be 2.5 billion years . the earth was a big , steriler steinklumpen with a lot of chemicals .
now , if you look at the way that chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of what you &apos;re doing .
and i think there are theories that start to understand how everything started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a vereinfachte story of what is that at this time , at this time , little öltröpfchen herumschwebten , which are different types of chemicals for chemicals .
some of these öltröpfchen contain a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and to grow .
they were all like , aufzuteilen .
these little öltröpfchen were the primitivste zellenform .
however , these öltröpfchen are not about living in the same sense , because every one of them was just a little , zufälliges recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , it has befindlichen chemicals around the more unequal amount of chemicals .
so that was a little bit different .
in fact , the tröpfchen , which grew up for growth is faster than others and integrated more and more chemicals on the outside of the outside and divided faster .
so these tend to survive longer longer , and it exploded into grösserem degrees .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interestingly , if this tröpfchen is a trick about abstraction .
in any way that we don &apos;t quite understand , this tröpfchen is the ability to niederzuschreiben information .
you &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , in a certain chemical chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , you &apos;ve found a way in this geistlosen , evolutionary species that allowed them to be niederzuschreiben what they were made , so that this information could be stored and get copied .
the amazing thing is that this kind of information is to store information over time over the time of 2.5 billion years where they were born , right .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is the exact same code , which is exactly the same code and the same notation .
and each creature uses the exact same code and the same code .
we &apos;re as far as we can , just to be able to write in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 mikrogramm of a white pulvers , which i try to keep in the airports away from sicherheitspersonal .
now , what i &apos;ve done is , i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code consists of normal letters , which we use to symbolisieren -- and i &apos;ve written my visitenkarte on a piece of dna , and i verstärkt it 10 ^ 22 .
so if someone wants a hundred million copies of my visitenkarte , i have enough for everyone in this room and even for everyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
in fact , i would have been a egoist , i would have written it on a virus and released in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
and the dna of dna was an interesting step .
and the veranlagten of these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened , a very interesting step where things were completely different , which is that they started to communicate these cells and share information information , so that communities came from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually replace their dna .
that &apos;s the reason why the consistency of antibiotics grow .
some bacteria have figured out how to go away from penicillin and have this information together with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria , which are resistant to penicillin , because the bacteria communicate with each other .
this communication is now allowed for communities of communities that were in some sense in the same boat ; they were synergetisch .
so they could either survive together , or they went down . that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community have been repeated more repeatedly and by evolution .
so the übergangsstelle is where these communities are so close to the prescription that they decided to write the recipe for the entire community in the dna .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at that point , we have mehrzellige communities , communities of a lot of verschiedlichen , which together as a single organism .
in fact , we are one such community .
we have a lot of cells , which is not on themselves .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started weiterzuentwickeln , so that the level that the evolution was happening is no longer the individual cell , but the whole zellengemeinschaft that we call .
the next step is now in these communities .
the zellengemeinschaften started to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures that made nothing else to process as information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the informationsverarbeitungsapparat that have built these zellengemeinschaften .
they started to train specialists within the community , in particular structures , which were responsible for learning and understanding information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that moment , one individual -- learning happened in the time of the lifespan of a single organism , rather than this evolutionary period .
so one organism organism could learn how to eat a certain fruit , not to eat and made him sick , the last time he was eating her .
now , within the life of a single organism , if there were hundreds of thousands of years ago , because of hundreds of thousands of years , because of this information had learned from the individuals who died because of these fruit , because these informationsverarbeitungsstrukturen were not there yet .
so the nervous system has the evolutionsprozess system in this particular system , because evolution could take place within an individual .
it could take place within a time .
what happened after that was that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
so , for example , the raffinierteste version of this kommunikationsart is the human language .
it &apos;s a fairly amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , unordentliche and verwirrte idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting there , and i &apos;m basically going to give sound sound from me to create a similar idea of the way in your head that has a sense of similarity with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , it turns out to sound a sequence of sound sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to be a unified organism again .
and what we &apos;ve actually made , we , of course , is we started to abstract .
we go through the same steps that have gone through -- the abstraction of our methods , as we can capture data .
so , for example , the invention of the language was a small step in this direction .
telefonie , computers , videobänder , cd-roms , and so on all of our spezialisierten mechanisms that we built in our community to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something that &apos;s much bigger , and also able to develop faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today , evolution can happen at the time of mikrosekunden .
you &apos;ve also seen tys little evolutionsbeispiel , where he showed a little bit of evolution in the convolution program , right in front your eyes .
so we have verschnellert the zeitskalen again .
the first step steps of the story i told you about , dauerten a billion years .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , is a few hundred million years .
then the nächstens steps , like language and so on , less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , they seem a few decades .
the process is feeding itself , and it &apos;s going to be , i think auto-katalytisch is the word for it -- if something verstärkt it .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explosionsartigen curve curve .
we see the process that lives on themselves .
i live a living living for living in computers , and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism that i &apos;m using to build computers , not using computers , without using computers , without having been able to work on computing .
my current practice is to start designing objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design this in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every transistor in the verbindungsmaschine does .
it has billions of them .
what i do , and what i do , and what i think , in the designers of thinking of thinking , we think , in a certain abstraktionsebene , and the machine is doing something that makes our skills far better than we could ever do .
and it makes it partly with ways that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
a method which is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve used in the last time is evolution itself .
so , we install a evolutionsprozess in the machine , which is going on in the mikrosekunden-bereich .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can make a program that evolves from random instructions .
and we say , &quot; computers , please , a hundred million , like the instructions of the instructions .
now , please take all these randomly chosen the instructions , take all the programs , and pick the ones who are the ones who are the next . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to sort of sortieren numbers , which would be a simple example that i &apos;ve been using before .
so find programs that can the most sortieren numbers into the numbers .
of course , a chance for random , the instructions that they happen to be very small , that they just sort of sortieren numbers , so probably none of the instructions will do this .
but one of them might have two numbers of the two numbers in the right order .
now i &apos;m saying , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences that have come to my vorgaben .
they store them , lösche the rest .
now , all of the übriggebliebenen that the numbers have best in .
and this is with a way of rekombinierens , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their subroutinen , and the kids vererben the properties of the subroutinen of the two programs .
so i &apos;ve got a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that came a little closer to vorgaben than others .
tell , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
bewerte them again .
maybe some mutations .
and try and do this with another generation .
all these generations need a few milliseconds .
and so i can go through evolution over millions of years in the computer within a few minutes , or more complex times , a few hours .
and finally , i get programs that can get numbers perfectly consistent .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write by hand .
so if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t say how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s verworrene and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , and i &apos;m sure that you do the job because they come from a series of hunderttausenden programs that have done the job .
because their lives depended on whether they did the job .
i sat there in a 747 with marvin minsky , he ale a map and he says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
it says , &quot; this plane is from hunderttausenden kleinteilen , which work together to make your flight safer . &apos; don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
we know that a entwicklungsprozess is not optimal when it becomes too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers , for a process which is really different from classical engineering engineering .
he allows us to make things with a much higher complexity than the normal methods would allow us to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the possibilities of it .
so , gewissermassen überflügelt us .
we use these programs now to make the computer much faster , so that we can explain these processes faster .
so it creates a rückkopplung .
it &apos;s going to be faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all of these new technologies today are feeding themselves .
we run up .
we &apos;re at a point where analog is at the time when einzeller-organismen evolved to mehrzeller-organismen .
so we &apos;re the amöben , and we can &apos;t really make up what the hell we &apos;re doing here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this übergangpunkt .
but i really believe that there is something else .
i think it &apos;s very hochmütig from us to say that we &apos;re the final product of evolution .
and i think , all of us here are part of the creation of what comes next .
now , the lunch is before and i think i &apos;m going to hear here now before i &apos;m going to hear .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert with sufi-sänger mukhtiar ali .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the time of ancient indian epos . &quot;
if we wanted to travel then , we left in a car and schwirrten on the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
at the time , when the big indian durst , he took a bow , he took a bow , shot in the ground and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with bohrern and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
it really made me sad .
i got some fear of technology .
i was afraid i could lose the ability to be able to enjoy the sunset without a camera , and without tweet to my friends .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silberne taschenuhr .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the magischste thing for me .
it became an goldener access to a world of pirates and verunglückter ships and pictures in my mind .
i was like , when we were holding our send clocks and cameras from it to dream .
they kept us being inspired by this .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use them , rather than killing magic .
with 16 , i started illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling that can connect readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it takes images and text , and animation , sound and touch .
the story used more senses .
but what do we do with this ?
i &apos;m just going to go to khoya , an interactive ipad .
it says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here says , &quot; this box -- &quot; this box -- &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to get a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down for me -- and the ipad knows with gps where i live -- it &apos;s really addressiert to me .
the child in me is really excited about these possibilities .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean the magician and kites , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i was always exciting .
you &apos;ve got to blow the ipad ipad and make these fireflies fireflies .
and the light on the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can be in a single murmel .
and so here &apos;s a book , and every world &apos;s going to be a little bit of a book , and every one of the world that i take here to the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
fantasybücher had always been maps , but these are static static .
this map grows and it &apos;s shining and serves in orientation the rest of the book .
it &apos;s also showing you other places in the book .
i &apos;m going in here .
it &apos;s really important for me to make something that indisch is also very zeitgemäß .
these are the apsaras .
we all heard of feen and nymphen , but how many people outside of india know their indian colleagues , the apsaras ?
the poor apsaras were trapped in indras chambers , in an old muffigen book .
and we bring them back to a more contemporary story for children .
a story that terms of new issues , like the umweltkrise .
the issue , a huge problem of the last 10 years is that children are sitting in their rooms , on their computers , without out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search for a search , you &apos;ve got to go out and raise the ipads images of the ipads pictures of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of stöckern , rocks , rocks and muscheln .
somehow , children don &apos;t do anymore .
this is going to be zurückgebracht . you have to go out to make a picture of a flower and tag .
in another chapter , you have to fotographieren a piece of baumrinde and tag .
so you actually , you create a digital collection of photographs that you can put online .
a kid in london shows the picture of a fuchses and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
it creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of ways to connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction where you use the video of the ipads and through augmented reality , you see an animation that looks at a plant in front of the house .
in a place , the screen füllt with leaves .
you have to do the sound of the winds , you blow and read the rest of the book .
we all move into a world where the natural forces of technology are closer and closer in the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and closer to the natural world and make the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of history .
thank you .
this is really a extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in untersuchungshaft , prisons or todeszellen .
i spend most of my time with the social weakest and in places in places that there are a lot of hopelessness .
being here at ted , to see , to see , is given to me very much .
in the short time here , i got an obvious one : ted .
you can say things here that have influence worldwide .
and sometimes , when something comes to ted , it gets a meaning and force that else wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher &apos;s words , but the words of a dedicated teacher are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . but as a fürsorglicher doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i was big in a family , a traditional afroamerikanischen household , who was dominated by a matriarchin dominated , and this matriarchin was my grandmother .
she was a taffe , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every familienstreit .
it was also the origin of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a sklavenfamilie .
their parents were born in the 1840ern in virginia as a slave .
it was born around 1880 and the experience of slavery formed their world .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also liebevoll .
when i met her as a young boy , she came up to me and umarmte me .
she pushed me so that i couldn &apos;t breathe . then she made me go .
one or two hours later , if i came across her , she came up to me and said , &quot; bryan , you feel about my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , she umarmte me . if i said , &quot; yes , let me go .
to her was something that was that you wanted to be near .
the only problem was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins walked around everywhere .
i remember , i must be eight or nine or nine that i woke up in the morning , and all my cousins walked around .
my grandmother was at the end of the zimmers and staring at me .
first , i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and smiling , but she looked very seriously .
this was about 15 or 20 minutes , and she stood up and came over . she took me over , and she said , &quot; come on , bryan . you and i , we need to talk . &quot;
and i remember it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out and said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you &apos;re not weitersagst . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; ehrenwort ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to give me three things , bryan . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; as the first versprich me , you &apos;re going to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to do with promise that you &apos;re always going to care . &quot;
i verehrte my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; as the next versprich me , you &apos;re going to do the right thing . &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , and i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise me is &quot; you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old and so i said , &quot; yeah , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old south , rural south , and i have a brother a year older , and a year older .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home , and i got this sixpack beer , and he took my sister , and he went to the forest .
we &apos;re just alberten around like otherwise .
and then he took a drink of beer and offered my sister &apos;s sister , and she took me , and then offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no . it &apos;s all right . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do that today , you &apos;re going to do everything we do .
i had what , your sister had a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . do you just do . &quot;
my brother staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? now trink . &quot;
and he looked at the face , and he said , &quot; oh no , no , you don &apos;t still do you &apos;re still crazy about the conversation with granny ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother tells all the grandchildren that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to tell you something .
i should not do that .
this may be übertragen .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i gestehe that i &apos;d never drink a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s tugendhaft . i say that because it means identity .
if we can create the right kind of identity , we can tell people things around us that they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they are something special .
my grandfather was in the prohibition in prison .
my uncle died of alkoholinduzierten diseases .
and she believed that these are the issues that we had to care about .
i tried to say something about our justizsystem .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were 300,000 people in haftanstalten and prison .
now , there are 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest inhaftierungsrate of the world .
seven million people are discharged or bedingter strafaussetzung .
and i think of the world has fundamentally changed our world .
in social and black parts of the population of the population of the population and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male black black between 18 and 30 is in prison in prison , in prison or bedingter or bedingter .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles , to washington to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all the black men in prison in prison , in prison in prison or bedingter .
but our system is not just formed by questions that have to do with rassenzugehörigkeit , it will also entstellt by poverty .
we &apos;ve got a justizsystem in this country that they treat much better if they are rich and guilty as poor and innocent .
wealth , not verschulden , affect the result .
yet we seem to be satisfied with it .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost in touch .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there are some hochinteressante developments .
my home in alabama in alabama , in alabama , ihnen , if you &apos;re strafrechtlich .
here and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male population is lost their wahlrecht .
we prognostizieren that in 10 years , in 10 years , the death of the civic ehrenrechte will be as high as high as high as the verabschiedung of the wahlrechtsgesetzes .
the silence is ohrenbetäubend .
i vertrete children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world , dreizehnjährige children in prison .
in this country , there are lebenslängliche haftstrafen without diseases .
we &apos;ve already got a lot of operations .
the only country in the world .
i vertrete people in todeszellen .
the death rate is an interesting question .
we believe that because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is , does it make a human dying for one of him ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other perspective is not : does somebody deserves a crime for a crime , but did we make it to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
death sentence in america is defined by error .
in nine people we &apos;ve been executed , comes to one that we had for innocent , who was released for entlastet .
an amazing fehlerquote . one of nine unschuldig .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let someone fly with an airplane when for nine planes , the answer , one .
but somehow we &apos;re going to make it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question of whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m going to talk to my students afroamerikanische , i &apos;m going to talk about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time at the end of rekonstruktion , until the beginning of the world war war .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
but for the black men in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynchmobs .
or before bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
and these older people come to me and say , &quot; mr , stevenson , you &apos;re talking to me , you &apos;re talking to me , you &apos;re talking about saying to say that we have to do it for the first time in the history of our nation , after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after that terrorism , of course , the rassentrennung and decades of rassistisch motivated and apartheid .
and yet , in our country , in our country , we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what we did in the historical context .
we &apos;re all the time .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to get us to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we are not willing to be willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the rassentrennung is not to overcome , without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , it was those willingness , but not in this country .
i have a couple of talks in germany about the death .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply verstörend to hear that way . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death sentence .
and of course , they can never give them more in germany . &quot;
it was a silence , and then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever kill ourselves for the systematic killing of people .
it would be gewissenlos by us , aware and target people . &quot;
i thought about it .
how it would feel like to live in a world where the german state made humans , especially if there were a lot of jews .
it would be unerträglich .
it would be gewissenlos .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old südens , we &apos;re going to get people &apos;s risk , and here &apos;s the risk of the risk of the age of the old , and there &apos;s 22 times more than it &apos;s black , and 22 times higher when the angeklagte is black and the victim knows -- in the same states , where the body is gelynchter people .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental abkopplung .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with this , with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are affected as well .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but eventually , these realities are going to be überschattet of suffering , abuse , herabsetzung , ausgrenzung .
it seems to be important to me to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about that that we need more hope , more commitment , more commitment to pass in a complex world .
for me , it means to produce time , and talk about the poor , the benachteiligten , the ones who will never be at ted .
but think of a way that is embedded in our own lives .
we all need to believe in the end of things we can &apos;t see .
we &apos;re doing that . so we &apos;re as much as we &apos;ve also appreciate .
innovation , creativity , and development doesn &apos;t just come from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s these kopf-herz-verbindung that i think they &apos;re driving us not just to be open for all the bright and begeisternden things , but also for the dark and problematischen .
vaclav havel , the great tschechische politician , once said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe , we wanted to do all sorts of things , but what we needed most , was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be sometimes in hoffnungslosen places , to be witness . &quot;
this spiritual orientation is the core of what i think you need to get involved for .
there &apos;s no distinction about technology and design that allows us to be human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , ausgrenzung and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity requires much more of us than if we didn &apos;t take care of it .
she &apos;s going to touch it deeply .
as a young lawyer , i hatt hatt the great privilege .
woman kept coming back to montgomery , where they were two of their oldest friends of their oldest friends , traf. these older women , johnnie carr , who organized the montgomery-busboykott -- an incredible afroamerikanerin -- and virginia durr , a white one whose husband , clifford durr , dr. king vertrat .
so these women came together , and they were einfach .
and then , as a woman called me and he said , &quot; bryan , lady parks comes into the city . we want to talk .
do you want to listen and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , very like . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and just stopped .
it was always so inspiring , so beflügelnd .
one day , i was sitting there , and after a few hours , and after a few hours , woman &apos;s parks to tell us , &quot; well , bryan , tell me what the initiative initiative is right .
what are you trying to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to work against injustice .
wr want people to help people who were convicted .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in strafvollzugssystem .
we want to eliminate lebenslängliche haftstrafen for children .
we want something about the death penalty company .
we want to reduce the number of deaths .
we want to eliminate masseninhaftierungen .
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; mhmm . mhmm . &quot;
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to make you very , very tired . &quot;
and then woman lehnte in front of me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why they have to be very , very tapfer . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be tapferer .
we need to make ways to ask this challenges : these problems , that .
because ultimately our humanity depends , of our humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i learned some very simple things .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
if somebody lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear him , it &apos;s not just a plant .
even who kills someone is not just a murderer .
and because that &apos;s so , there &apos;s a basic human dignity that has to respect the law .
i think in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t believe that .
i think that in many places , the opposite of poverty justice .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so inspiring , we &apos;re not at the end of the technology , not to the things that we develop , not to our intellect and minds .
ultimately , a society is not going to measured how they &apos;re being treated and powerful and powerful and privileged and privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the verurteilten , the verurteilten .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us up .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story to end .
sometimes i push too much .
i &apos;m going to get tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas are ahead of our thinking , in the very important way .
i vertrete these kids who were convicted of very hard punishment .
i &apos;m going to untersuchungsgefängnis and visit a client who &apos;s 13 or 14 years old , and it might be as an adult .
then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn someone into something that he isn &apos;t ?
the judge is looking at him as adults , but i see a child .
and one night i stayed up too long and i thought , my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he must have zauberkräfte .
right , bryan , the judge has zauberkräfte .
you should have a wish .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think really properly , i started working on a bill .
i had a 14jährigen , poor black boys as a client .
and i started to with this . the headline , and the headline said , the headline , my poor , 14jährigen clients like a privileged , white client .
in my quest to me , i explained that fehlverhalten fehlverhalten and the police and verfahrensfehler .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , there &apos;s nothing more rechtens that there is still error .
the next morning , i woke up and i didn &apos;t know if i was just dreamed of these crazy , or actually had written .
and i didn &apos;t just write him on my shock , but sent him to the court .
a few months pass and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i &apos;ve got to the court and this crazy case .
i went into the car , and i was really overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
finally , i went from my car and went up to the court .
when i was the staircase to the court , there was an elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and umarmte me .
and then he flüsterte me .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of it . &quot;
and i have to say , there was force .
it touched something deeply deeply in me , identity , the ability of every single person , to contribute to a community , to a community of hope .
well , i entered the gerichtssaal .
as soon as the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , did you put these crazy bill ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
i wrote these crazy things .
polizeibeamte came in and stellvertretende staatsanwälte and office workers .
in the handumdrehen , the gerichtssaal was full of people who were angry , we were talking about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my augenwinkel , i saw the janitors and down .
he kept looking through the window and he could hear the whole tohuwabohu .
he went up and down .
finally , this older black man came up with a very besorgten gesichtsausruck in the gerichtssaal , and i sat down right behind me , almost at the verteidigungsbank .
ten minutes later , the judge quit a pause .
during the break , there was a polizeibeamter in the pause that was the janitors in the gerichtssaal .
this deputy ran across to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the gerichtssaal ? &quot;
the old black man stood up . he looked at the deputy , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to say , &quot; i &apos;m here to say to this young man , lose the goal . don &apos;t give them . &quot;
i came to ted because i think a lot of you understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far ausschwingt , but it &apos;s justice .
that we &apos;re not fully developed as humans , unless we care about human rights and grundwerte .
so our survival of all the survival is to survive each individual .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity with humanity , pity and justice .
and most of all , i want to tell those of you who &apos;ll just say , just saying , you don &apos;t lose the goal of the eyes . don &apos;t give up .
you have the audience in this audience , this community , you &apos;ve seen an obvious wish and to help you to do something .
what else can we do ?
bryan stevenson : well , there are possibilities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a volksentscheid in this spring , in fact , in fact , a effort to do something about the geldstrom , which is otherwise in the politics of punishment .
here , in california , in california , you &apos;re going to get a billion dollars for the death sentence for a billion dollars .
and yet 46 percent of all tötungsdelikte doesn &apos;t end with a verhaftung .
56 percent of vergewaltigungsfälle are not in court .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
this referendum is going to be able to invest in more sicherheitskräfte and safety .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
over the last three decades , the verbrechensrate is gesunken in america .
this is a lot of the fact in a context with increased inhaftierungszahlen .
what would you tell someone who believes this ?
well , in fact , the number of gewaltverbrechen doesn &apos;t change very much .
most of the masseninhaftierungen in this country wasn &apos;t really found in the class of gewaltverbrechen .
it was the fehlgeleitete kreuzzug against drugs .
that &apos;s why the dramatic numbers are in prison .
we have hinreißen from the rhetoric from the rhetoric .
now , we &apos;ve got &quot; drei-verstöße , &quot; -gesetze , the people who get on bars , for a fahrraddiebstahl , for the theft of good , instead of doing it , you forces the things to give back the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a straftat , not less .
and i believe that our current don &apos;t help anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
bryan , you really have brought a string to schwingen .
you &apos;re an inspiring personality .
thank you for ted . thank you .
bin laden is taking an increased gefahrenrisiko .
two : famine in somalia . there are three : spray spray of the police .
there are 4 : bösartige . there &apos;s five : dangerous kreuzfahrtschiffe .
number 6 : social decline . there are seven : 65 dead .
8 : tsunamiwarnung . 9 : cyber-attacken .
different speakers : drogenkrieg . tornado .
recession . a standstill . syria . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so this is just a couple of the clips i collected over the last six months -- but it could also have been the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative subjects because our minds are getting attention to these issues .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second , every day , our senses begin to process much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because there &apos;s nothing more important than our survival , the first stop for all the information is a part of our temporallappens , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our frühwarnsystem system , our gefahrendetektor .
it sortiert all the information on the search for any andeutung of danger in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage , when it blutet , is going to go up , is very true .
well , with all of our digital devices , the week for us seven days , the day of all the time all the week , all the week , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is always worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the enormous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century , through a series of forces that we &apos;ve done in the last century , in the next three decades , is to create a world of abundance .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we have no big problems -- climate crisis , artensterben , water and energieprobleme -- we already have .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at solving problems in a very long view , but ultimately , to get through .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , which is inflation angepasste angepasste the world &apos;s population has tripled .
child mortality has verringert for a tenth .
and it comes out of the ernährungs- , elektrizitäts- transport- and communication communication .
steve pinker showed us that we &apos;re currently living in a very peaceful time of life .
and charles kenny has gone from 25 percent over the last 130 years from 25 percent to 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
in fact , we &apos;ve neu poverty .
remember that a big percentage of americans who live under the poverty line , access to power , water , toilets , kühlschränken , mobile phones , mobile phones and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the imperatoren of the earth , could never be able to dream luxusgüter .
the basis of a lot of these are technologies , and these are growing expotentiell .
my good friend kurzweil kurzweil has shown us that every tool that is going to be with information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law law , and the preis-performance-quotient all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less and more thousand times less than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
notice two things about this curve .
first of all , how geschmeidig it is -- in good times , war or peace , recession , depression and hochkonjunktur .
this is the result of faster computers to build faster computers .
it doesn &apos;t slow down for neither of our big problems .
also , despite her logarithmic verlaufs on the left , it &apos;s verläuft .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a bunch of extraordinary technologies that are available to everybody .
&quot; cloud-computing , &quot; something that is called my friends , &quot; infinite-computing , &quot; nennen , 3d-drucker , &quot; etwas , 3d-drucker , that allow to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , fuels , vaccine and food , digital medicine , nano-materialien and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have the victory of ibms supercomputer watson at risk ?
that was big .
i &apos;ve been looking for the newspapers and looking for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson bezwingt human enemies . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence would be available every owner of a mobiltelefones .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i &apos;m here at ted , a new university called &quot; singularity university . &quot;
we bring our students at all of these technologies , so focused on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we asked the students to create companies to create products and services within a decade positive that makes life affect billions of people .
think about that that a group of students today can affect the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
today , we can be able to have dozens of companies that did exactly this .
if i think of creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of opportunities .
it &apos;s about creating überfluss gütern .
now scarcity is kontextbezogen , and technology is a ressourcen force force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of napoleon iii. in the mitte century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
napoleons soldiers got silber-besteck , napoleon selbst himself .
but the king of siam had aluminium-besteck .
aluminum was the most precious metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and platin .
this is why the dome of the washington-monuments was made of aluminum aluminum .
even though aluminum is starting from erdmasse percent , it doesn &apos;t get a pure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silikate .
but then the technology of elektrolyse became developed and made aluminiumherstellung so cheap that we use it with our wegwerf-mentalität .
then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we think about energieknappheit today .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re filled on a planet that is filled with more energy than we use a year .
16 terawatt energy prasseln all 88 minutes on the surface of the earth .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is .
and there &apos;s good news .
this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time , the cost of solar growth in india to 50 percent of the diesel-stroms -- 8.8 rupees , compared to 17 17 rupees .
the cost of solar panels in the last year to 50 percent .
last month , this is published with a study that shows that up to the end of this decade , the united states is six cents six cents a kwh , compared to 15 cents at national average .
and if we have a energieüberschuss , we will also have water .
let &apos;s talk about wasser-kriege .
do you remember , as carl sagan was the voyager-raumfahrzeug in 1990 , when it was saturn , back to the earth ?
he took a famous picture photo . how did it be ?
&quot; a pale of blue . &quot;
because we live on a wasserplaneten .
we live on a planet that is 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s 97,5 percent saltwater , two percent , two percent are vereist , and we &apos;re struggling to fight percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope .
and there are new technologies , not 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new nanotechnologien on the way , nano-materialien .
and from a conversation that morning with dean kaman , one of the innovators of doing it , i &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me permission -- his technolgie , who &apos;s called &quot; slingshot , &quot; and the many of you may have heard already . it has the size of a kühlschranks in studentenheim .
it can generate a thousand gallons of clean drinking drinking drinking water a day -- whether water , verschmutztes water , verschmutztes water , verschmutztes water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents a liter .
the president of coca-cola has just eingewilligt to start a large test-projekt with a hundred units in the developing world .
and if everything works well , and i &apos;m very optimistic , then coca-cola will apply this technology globally in 206 countries around the planet .
this is technologieunterstützte innovation that exists today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones too .
you get my goodness , we &apos;re going to reach the 70 percent of mobile phones in developing phones to the end of 2013 .
just think that a massai-krieger with a mobile phone in the middle of kenya in the middle of kenya , when president reagan were 25 years ago .
and if you search for your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in its abundance , as nobody could have ever predicted .
and it &apos;s still better , the things that you and i have spent several thousand dollars -- gps , hd-video and photograph , of books and music , technology to medical diagnostics -- literally literally entmaterialisiert and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best part of this is maybe what we expect in health .
so in the last month last month , i had the pleasure , &quot; $ 10 million qualcomm tricorder prize .
we demand team all over the world to connect all these technologies together in a cell phone so that you can talk to the device because it &apos;s equipped with ai , you can have reinhusten or your blutwerte .
and to win , the device has to be a better diagnosis than a team of hochqualifizierter doctors .
imagine this device , in the middle developing world , where there is no doctors , but 25 percent of the krankheitslast and 1.3 percent of the staff of healthcare .
if this device is a rna- , or dna-virus , which is not known , it calls to focus care and prevent a pandemic by an outbreak .
but now to the biggest force that &apos;s going to lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the 7-milliarden-marke .
and just by the way , the largest absicherung against one population explosion is a better education and food around the world .
so in 2010 , we had two billion people connected to each other .
by 2020 , we &apos;re steigen from two to five billion internetnutzer .
three billion new minds that we &apos;ve never heard before , will become the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what will you want ?
and instead of seeing economic gridlock , i see one of the greatest economic anschübe of history .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars in the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be getting healthier through the use of the tricoders , and they get trained by the khan-akademie , and by making the way that they have the opportunity to use 3d printers and make a lot more productive than ever before .
so , what can we get three billion growing , healthy , productive members of menschengemeinde us ?
what would it be with a set of new , never before .
how would it be , the oppressed , wherever they are , to give a voice to pay attention and create change change , the first time ?
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
how about beiträgen that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i learned by the x prize is that little teams that are inspired by passion and focus , that can create extraordinary things , things that have big companies and governments could create only in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some maybe you know .
it &apos;s a game called solved solved .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to evolve .
according to his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the medizinforschung .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university professors .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that the human pattern pattern is better than the best supercomputer supercomputer supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who was the best part of the world , it wasn &apos;t mit-professor , it was not an caltech-student , it was from england , manchester , woman , who was working in the day when he was working in a reha-klinik , and the best protein-ordnerin of the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me incredible trust in our future is the fact that we have more power today as individuals to confront the great challenges of our planet .
we &apos;ve got access to tools with an exponential technology .
we have the passion of a diy-innovatoren .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropen .
and we have three billion new minds with which we can work online for the new challenges , and to do what is necessary .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something about a verändernswertes piece of medical culture .
and i think it &apos;s with a medical doctor , and i am .
and maybe i &apos;m a long enough in the business , as i &apos;m able to give up a piece of my own false falschen to give you this .
but before i get to the real subject of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the saisonende close to the world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; moneyball &quot; seems to come and turn about statistics statistics and turn to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to get to a statistic from which i hope most of you have heard of .
it &apos;s the durchschnittsleistung of the schlägers .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a bat is 300 .
that means that the player will beat up three of 10 beats .
this is called the ball into außenfeld , he &apos;s going to be stuck , he &apos;s not getting stuck , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the first base , didn &apos;t have done it in time , and läufer was safe .
three from 10 .
do you know how to call a 300ter in in baseball baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a all-star .
do you know how to call a 400ter ?
this is someone in the rest of it is safe .
legendär , like ted williams legendär -- the last major league league player , during a regulären season , he met over 400 times .
so let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little bit less likely i &apos;ve talked to you about it .
suppose you &apos;ve got a blinddarmentzündung , and you &apos;re going to get to a operateur , whose durchschnittsleistung 400 is in terms of blinddarmentzündungen .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine living in a certain remote area , and you have a beloved people with verstopften herzkranzgefäßen and your hausarzt überweist this to a kardiologen , whose durchschnittsleistung is in 200 .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better this year . it &apos;s on the aufsteigenden branch .
and she beat a 257 .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you believe like the durchschnittsleistung for a kardiologen or a nurse or a nurse , or a geburtshelfer , should be a rettungsassistenten .
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in all of the medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor should be .
but what we &apos;re doing though is that we &apos;re eingeschlossen each of them , including me in the world to be entitled to be entitled perfect .
never make a mistake , no one does the details of how to be able to do this .
and that &apos;s the message i had in medical school .
i was a zwanghaft student student .
in high school , a mitschüler said that brian goldmann would learn goldmann for a bluttest .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little dachstube in the sisters on the toronto general hospital , unweit in the sisters .
i learned everything .
i met the origins , i learned the origins and the tail of every branch , every branch branch of every artery , which from the aorta , obskure and ordinary differentialdiagnosen .
i even knew the differentialdiagnose to classify renale tubuläre azidose .
and i &apos;ve got more and more and more .
and i was good , i schloss laude .
and i left medical school school with the idea that i knew if i knew everything and knew everything , or at least as much as possible as close to vollständigkeit as possible , i would be immune to do that from mistakes .
and it worked for a time until i met a printer .
i was residierte in toronto lehrkrankenhaus here in toronto as a woman in the notfallabteilung printer of the hospital in the hospital .
at that point , i was zugewiesen schicht layer in kardiologischen .
and it was my mission when the notfallpersonal kardiologischen piece of advice was looking at the notfallpatienten .
and feedback to my oberarzt .
i studied a printer , and she was in atemnot .
and when i listened to you , they made keuchende sounds .
and when i abhörte her breast , i could hear a knackendes sound on both sides , which told me that she was suffering under kongestiver heart failure .
this is a state that fails in the heart , instead of breaking all the blood on to pump a part of the blood in the lung , and then look at this gradually , and that gradually came up .
and that was not a hard to stellenden diagnosis .
i put her and made me on the treatment .
i gave her aspirin . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call diuretics , water , so that it ausschied the liquid .
and over a year and a half to two hours , they started to feel better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent them back home without my oberarzt .
i didn &apos;t take that up and do what i should have done , what i should have been , what was a phone call at my oberarzt , so that he had an opportunity to have a picture of his own image .
and he knew it , he would have been able to get more information .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the hilfsbedürftige doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take over that i was so successful , and so i would be able to worry for my patients without having to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
so i sent her home , i missachtete a little voice in me who was trying to tell me , &quot; goldman , no good idea . do not . &quot;
in fact , i was missing the nurse that i asked the nurse , who was taking care of the nurse , &quot; do you believe , &quot; do you believe it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about this , and the nurse said , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to go well . &quot;
i remember that as it was yesterday .
so i unterzeichnete the entlassungspapiere and an krankenwagen and rettungsassistenten , and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day i had this nagende feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , dungeon the hospital and went to drive home with the car , when i did something that i didn &apos;t do else .
i went home to my way home .
and there said another nurse , not the sister that had seen after woman , but another three words , and these three words , most of the most notfallärzte that i know .
other medical scientists are frightened of this as well , but the notfallmedizin is particularly special because we just see the patients .
the three words : remember , remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient they were sendeten ?
asked the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular tonlage .
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
about an hour after she arrived at home , after i sent it home , she collapsed , and the family called 911 , and the rettungsassistenten brought them back to the notfallstation with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous schockzustand .
they almost hardly breathe and was blue .
this notfallpersonal all strands .
they gave her blutdruckerhöher .
they schlossen them on the beatmungsmaschine .
i was shocked and i was shocked .
and i lived through this rollercoaster , because she came to the intensivstation intensivstation , and i hoped that she would recover .
and after two , three days , realized she would never be an awakening .
she didn &apos;t have a behandelbaren gehirnschaden .
their family got together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they led to the geschehenen .
on the neuten day , she liesen her -- woman , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say you &apos;re never to forget the names of people .
and that was the first time i learned that myself .
so the next couple of weeks , and i found the first time , and i was able to be isolated shame , which exists in our medical culture -- i felt isolated alone , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you &apos;re all familiar with the great friend of shame , even though you have a mystery of the best friend , and you &apos;re going to get it to the best friend , and the best friend , and the best friend and a terrible discussion , when one at the end of the end , the bad conscience , though , you know , you can never make such a mistake .
if you do wiedergutmachung and never make the mistake again .
this is the kind of lehrreicher shame .
the most unhealthy things i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you sick .
it &apos;s the one that tells you which is not what you did , it &apos;s bad , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t on the bottom of my oberarztes , he was very sweet .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure that he was the wogen , and i &apos;m sure that i couldn &apos;t get a verklagt .
but i asked these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the oberarzt ? why do i sendete them home ?
and then in my worst , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why did i go into medicine ?
but it certainly put it on .
i started feeling better .
and then in a bewölkten day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun , and i would say i could feel better again .
and i was that if i was doubling my efforts for the perfection and never again , again , the voice could be verstummen .
and she did .
and i kept working .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the notfallstation hospital in a kommunalen hospital north of toronto , and i begutachtete a 25 year-old man with gereiztem rachen .
it was a lot of us , and i was in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked at the rachen , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and when he went out of the door , he showed him on his rachen .
two days later , i came to my next notfalldienst , and my chefärztin asked me to talk to her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the gereizten ? &quot;
it turned out to be a streptokokken-infektion .
he had a potentially lebensgefährliche disease called epiglottitis .
you can google that , but it &apos;s not an infection of rachens , but the top of the top of the atemwege .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got intravenöse antibotica , and he recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same tortur of shame and selbstzweifel , felt me and went out of the work to work and again and again and again .
in a notfallschicht , i have a blinddarmentzündung übersehen .
there &apos;s a lot of things about this , especially when you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital at that time only 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there were probably no mängel in their treatment .
in one , i thought he was nierensteine .
i &apos;m going to ordnete the röntgen of the kidneys . when it was without befund , my colleague at the wiedervorstellung of the patient had a verhärtung in the lower right sector , and fest the operateure .
the other one had really strong .
i was ordnete to rehydrieren him and asked my colleagues as well as well .
and he did it and when he was in the right in the right in the right sector , he called the operateure .
in both cases , operierte , and it was good .
both of me nagten on me , fraßen me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues in my colleagues , but a total nonsense .
some of my klöpse happened happened in the last five years .
alone , ashamed and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t close with my mistakes and talk about them , if i agree with the quiet voice i can &apos;t find what really happened , what i can do with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i had a room -- like now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you have the last time you talk about fehlschlag about fehlschlag over fehlschlag ?
oh yes , you go to a cocktail of party , and you might have heard about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear someone about your mistakes .
if i had a room full of colleagues with colleagues and to tell you what i &apos;m telling you , i would not get to the end of the second story before you would really uncomfortable to you , anyone would get a joke , you would change the subject and forget the rest .
and in fact , if i would know , in fact , if i knew that a orthopäde in my hospital , you would have lost the wrong leg , you believe me , i would have trouble looking at the eyes .
this is the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two fundamental positions -- those who make mistakes and the ones that don &apos;t do . those who don &apos;t do it , and the ones that are schlafmangel and the without einschränkung , which are bad results with bad results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response as well as antibodies that attack people .
and there &apos;s the idea that when we make the mistakes from medicine from medicine to make us a safe system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of medical school and journalism , i &apos;ve been creating a personal study about medical errors and falsche treatments , so i could do anything for one of my first article that i was making for the toronto star of my show , &quot; white art , &quot; writing .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely unumgänglich .
we &apos;re working in a system that happens in a system that happens in a system which is either a wrong or wrong or wrong in which , over and more and more and more and more and more and more and devastation or dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians in umgänglichen mistakes .
in the united states , the institute of medicine ended up with 100,000 100,000 .
both of them are starke , because we don &apos;t see the problem as well as we should .
and is the crux .
in a krankenhaussystem in the medical school , every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
schlafmangel is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we own have a cognitive mistake , so we can take a perfect krankheitsverlauf for a patient pain .
then i take the same patient with brustschmerz , make it verschwitzt and geschwätzig and give it a very easily alkoholisierten breath , and suddenly the story is durchsetzt with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me about their symptoms .
all of these will be fehler .
so if you take the system , like i &apos;ve been taught , and all the fehlerbehafteten gesundheitsexperten , then there &apos;s no longer one left .
and you know the leier of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
so , in my show , &quot; white coat , black art , &quot; and i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about her ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show you with the microphone .
and then they extend , they &apos;ve come across the head , and they &apos;re looking down and schlucken , and they start telling their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes . &quot;
what they need is an environment that versetzt them .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
and the neu defined doctor is a human doctor , in fact , to know about his humanity , is not proud to make mistakes , but put everything out of them to learn so that it can be passed on .
you share your experience with others .
it supports the support of their mistakes .
and it shows others their mistakes , not about bloßzustellen , but in a liebevollen , supportive way all of them benefit .
and she works in a medical culture that recognized that people fill the system with life , and when that &apos;s so , people also make mistakes at time .
so that the system is going to develop backups , which people are going to be able to find out the way that we have to find the system that we have to find , in fact that the system is able to find out of potential , which is what &apos;s potential to do , and it &apos;s actually rewarded for people like me to make mistakes for the begradigung of these reward .
my name is brian goldman .
i have been neu .
i &apos;m a person . i make mistakes .
but i &apos;m bedaure das. , but i &apos;m trying to learn best from that to pass it to it .
i don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with it .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about veränderbare normwerte .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories about three stories to use time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know he was 1835 here .
you may think that he finken , but that &apos;s not true .
it &apos;s actually collected fish .
he described one of them as a very common .
it was a zackenbarsch .
to the &apos; 80s , he was gefischt in big style .
now it stands on the red list .
this story is we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still get to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
they still describe it as pristine .
what &apos;s happened here ?
the second story is to be a different concept called veränderbare taillenweite .
because i experienced it when i was in 1971 a lagoon in west-afrika .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad sonnenbrand , and i was convinced that i really didn &apos;t know .
it was my first sonnenbrand .
as you can see , the lagoon of palmen and by a few mangroven umsäumt .
there was buntbarsche from about 20 centimeters , schwarzkinnmaulbrüter , a unterart of buntbarsche .
the fischgründe of these buntbarsche were very ertragreich , and the fishermen lived well , and they were doing above average .
when i got back 27 years later , the fish was falling on half its size .
adults , they ausgewachsen five centimeters .
they were genetically erdrückt .
there were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the happiness to be there .
so it has nothing changed , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story is about my mittäterschaft in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 60s , in the early &apos; 60s , europe had a lot of entwicklungsprojekte .
fischförderung meant countries that started to have a hundred fish , which was pretty ugly .
and i went to that , and we were doing the entire southern südchinesischen sea and particularly in the javasee .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i now know that it was the bottom of the ocean .
90 percent of our fangs were sponges , other animals that are connected to the bottom .
the most part of the fish , the little dots there on the trümmern , the trümmerhaufen , were korallenriff-fische .
essentially , the bottom of the ocean is deck and became zurückgeworfen .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
within a year , you &apos;re going to take a survey and then start with the commercial fishing .
the reason is being changed -- in this case -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft coral corals is matschiger .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t eat , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a alive .
it wasn &apos;t ertrunken .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of trümmern is accumulated every single time , when they drive into areas , when they go into areas in places .
it &apos;s not going to documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adapt our normwerte of the new level , and we don &apos;t call ourselves what was there .
so , this is what happens .
on the y-axis is a couple of good things : biodiversity biodiversity , number of orca , the green of your country .
over time , it changes . it changes , because people are , of course .
every generation looked at the images that you &apos;re looking at at the beginning of your conscious life , as standard and it &apos;s going to flow everything .
the difference then is seen as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
there can be a sequence of changes .
and at the end , you just want to get the erbärmlichen remains remains .
so this is largely by our goal .
we want to get things that have disappeared or things that are no longer how they were .
you might think that the problem of people was felt , which is certainly when they lived in räuberischen societies , animals were killing , and they were aware of a couple of generations , what they had done .
because obviously an animal that &apos;s very common , very often , before it ausstirbt .
so you don &apos;t have a lot of other animals .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and therefore it &apos;s not going to be seen as a big loss .
at the time we focus on the big animals and the sea are the big fish .
they will be rare because we &apos;re going to catch them .
over time , there &apos;s little fish left and we think that &apos;s the normwert .
the question is why people accept this .
well , because you don &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , a lot of people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
they will confirm it , because the evidence of how they &apos;re in the previous form , they &apos;re not as they would like the evidence .
so , for example , there &apos;s anecdote , for example , the anecdote that the report that the report of a kapitäns , which , in this area in this area , could not be used , or from fischereiwissenschaftlern , usually not gewertet , because he is not scientific .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in sophisticated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous big role that can play a marine game .
because in marine reserves , we basically think about the past .
we think the past that the past that people can &apos;t understand because they have changed and very low .
so the people who see a marine reserve , and that will benefit from the insight that allows it to zurücksetzen your normwerte .
what about the people who aren &apos;t possible , because they don &apos;t have any access -- the people in the middle west ?
here , i think , the art and the film might fill the gap and fill the gap and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was grauwale -- 500 years ago .
and the farbtöne and -schattierungen may remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were being touched by this -- apart from the pocahontas-geschichte , why were they so touched by the bilderwelt ?
because it &apos;s something that &apos;s been lost in a way .
so i mean , i mean , the only thing i &apos;m going to do is cameron , so that it &apos;s &quot; ii ii .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist ostdeutschland , you had to , if you had a typewriter , you had to open up the government .
they also had to check a sheet from this typewriter .
the reason for that , the government could zurückverfolgen , where it came from .
they found an article with falschem gedankengut , and they were able to track the creator of these thoughts .
and we couldn &apos;t understand in the west how anyone could do that , and how much that would be the speech of speech .
in our own countries , we would never do this .
but if you &apos;re in 2011 , in 2011 , in 2011 , we buy a new farblaserdrucker and a page , and it has a little light yellow yellow yellow flecke on every page , in a pattern that makes the page clear to them and rückverfolgen their printer .
this is what happens today .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be aufzuregen .
and this was an example of what our own governments our own governments are using the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three hauptquellen of the existing world today .
let &apos;s look at what actually happens in the world : we can divide the attacks in categories .
we have three hauptgruppen .
there are online-kriminelle .
for example , this is mr. dimitry golubow from kiew in ukraine .
and the motives of online-kriminellen are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use online-angriffe to make a lot of money , a huge pile of money .
there are several known cases of online-millionären , multimillionären , who made their money on attacks .
this is wladimir tsastsin from tartu in estonia .
this is alfred gonzalez .
stephen watts .
björn sundin .
this is matthew anderson , tariq al-daour and so on and so forth .
these people have come online , but they have acquired it , but they have acquired it , but they have made it all of our bankkonten , as we do our online-banking , as we &apos;re doing our online-banking , or also keylogger , who collected our kredikarteninformationen at input at the keyboard while we were shopping about a infected computer online .
the u.s. intelligence agency , two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam jain here , and it was a 14,9 million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain itself is on free feet , which is unknown .
and i would argue that today it &apos;s more likely to become victims of a online-verbrechens , as a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only getting worse .
in the future , most crimes will play online .
the second largest angreifergruppe that we can see today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protest , an opinion , or through their audience .
groups like anonymous are in the last 12 months and they have become one of the hauptspieler in the field of online-angriffe .
so these are the three hauptangriffsgruppen : criminals who do it for money , hacktivisten like anonymous who do it , but the last group are nations , governments who lead the attacks .
there are cases that are like diginotar .
it shows what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
diginotar is a vollmachtszertifikat from the netherlands -- or it was .
in the last autumn , it had to be insolvenz , because diginotar had been hacked .
someone has been hacked and had been gründlich the system .
and last week in a meeting with dutch regierungsvertretern , i asked one of the leitenden of this group , if he was able to make it for possible , because of the diginotar-hacks people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die in the consequence of such ?
diginotar is a zertifizierungsstelle .
they sell zertifikate .
what do you do with zertifikaten ?
now , a certificate , you need a website with https , for example , with ssl-verschlüsselten , for example .
now , all of us , gmail or a lot of us , gmail or a lot of us , gmail or a lot of us , gmail or a lot of us , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you can trust that you can trust more trust than local anbietern , and that they &apos;re verschlüsselt over ssl-verbindungen , so the local government can &apos;t get into their conversation .
but can you , if you get into a foreign race .
zertifizierungsbehörde hacken and gefälschte zertifikate .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in diginotar .
how about the arab spring and the things that happened in egypt ?
now , in egypt , the dominated in april 2011 in april 2011 , the headquarters of the egyptian geheimpolizei , and they found a lot of records .
in this records , a folder was called &quot; finfisher . &quot;
and in this folder , notes in the deutschland community , which had to sell a couple of programs that had sold a few programs that they were -- in very large scale -- all the communication of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for 280.000 euros to the egyptian government .
the firmenhauptquartier is right here .
so western governments provide governments with hilfsmitteln , so that they can use their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago , a couple of weeks ago , this was a trojaner that was used by german regierungsvertretern to bespitzeln their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be verdächtigt , you know , you &apos;re pretty much secure with your phone .
but today we are far beyond .
they tap the connection connection .
they use tools like the staatstrojaner to bespielen their computers with a trojaner , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their online-diskussionen abzuhören to collect their passwörter .
so if we keep thinking about these things like this , the obvious answer to people , the obvious answer , &quot; ok , it sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter because i &apos;m a braver citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we today , in 2011 , in 2011 , our governments like trust , it &apos;s every right we &apos;re going to make for forever .
and we trust , we trust each future government , a government we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions we need to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of betonblocksteinen .
the first betonblocksteine were made 1868 and entstammten of a simple idea : module that fit out of zement out .
betonbausteine were very quickly die in the world in the world .
they put us in able to build things that were bigger than us , buildings , bridges , a stone after another .
essentially , the betonbaustein has become a building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out with this .
it &apos;s called verbindende stone .
and in a few years , lego moved to every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for everyone .
lego is essentially the betonbaustein , the building block of the world , took a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the same year , the bell labs was announced the next revolution , the next building block .
the transistor was a little plastikeinheit , which is a world of static , aufeinandergestapelten building blocks to a world where everything was interactive .
like the betonblock , the transistor allows us to build much larger , more complex internet , a stone after another .
but there &apos;s a hauptunterschied one : the transistor was just for experts .
i don &apos;t personally accept that that &apos;s a building block for our zeit , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started exploring this idea , how to put the power of engineers into the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing littlebits .
let me show you how they work .
littlebits are electronic module , which have a specific function .
they &apos;re vorgefertigt , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best thing about this is that they connect with magnets .
so you can &apos;t put them wrong .
the stones are farbcodiert .
green is a piece , blue is stream , pink is input and orange is wires .
so , all of what you need to do is a blue one , and you can get them together , and you can build very quickly größere .
they add one blue blue one , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between , and you made a little dimmer switch .
take the switch out around a pulsmodul , which is here , einzufügen , and you made a little blinker .
add that buzzer for an extra effect , and you made a lärmmaschine .
i &apos;ll stop that .
over the simple play , littlebits is actually quite powerful .
rather than that you &apos;ve got to program , or you have to program , you need to code with simple , intuitive gestures .
so in order to accelerate and accelerate it , they just turn it down to this button , and it makes the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind littlebits is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want every single interaction in this world to get a gebrauchsfertigen stone .
lights , sounds , solarelemente , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve spread littlebits to children and see them play with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is how they start to understand the electronics in the everyday life , and they don &apos;t learn in school .
like , for example , a nachtlicht works , or why the doors respond to the aufzugs , or how to respond to a touch .
we also brought littlebits to designschulen .
so , for example , we had no designers with any experience in electronic things that started playing with littlebits as a material .
here we are , with filz , paper and water water , like geordie ...
a couple of weeks ago , we got littlebits risd , and we gave them some designers , who had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; power . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project they did , a bewegungsgesteuerte konfetti-kanone .
but let &apos;s wait , this is really my lieblings-projekt .
it &apos;s a hummer of play-doh , the fear of the darkness .
for these nicht-ingenieure , littlebits was another material , which was another material material .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
so , littlebits open source .
you can go to the website , you can download and download it yourself .
we want the world the world of creators , the inventor who encourage mitwirkenden , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
so , pull out and start to invent it .
thank you .
