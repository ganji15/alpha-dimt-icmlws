you know , one of the great vernügen in the travel , and one of the freuden in ethnographischen research with the people who can remember the old days , which is still in the wind still in the wind , in the wind , in the wind , and they touch geglätteten stones , in the bitteren branches of plants .
and the importance of the elders the oldest of the oldest of the oldest of the elders , or that in the himalayas of the oldest of the elders of the elders of the elders of the elders is still , or that in the himalayas of the oldest of the elders is , is that the point of reality , or that in the himalayas , we live in an absolute sense , but just as a model of reality , as a consequence of a group that we have to have , although successful successfully , chose a lot of generations ago .
and of course , we all share the same anpassungsnotwendigkeiten .
we &apos;re all born . we bring kids to the world .
we go through initiationsrituale .
we have to deal with the unaufhaltsamen trennung through death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dancing and making art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique sense of liedes , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s about the penan in the forests , or the branches in the forests , or the warrior in the forests of the desert , or the warrior in the middle of the sahara , and this is the colleague that i &apos;ve traveled to a month ago , or even a month ago , or even a yak-hirte on the side of the qomolangma , everest , the gottmutter of the world .
all of these people are teaching us that there are other existenzmöglichkeiten , other ways of thinking , other ways of orientation on earth .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , there &apos;s only one with hope with hope .
together together , the unzähligen cultures in the world form a network of spirituellem and kulturellem lives , which is the earth umhüllt , and for the reason that the earth is important as important as biological lebensnetz that you know as the biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural lebensnetz as a ethnosphäre , and ethnosphäre can be able to think of all the thoughts and dreams , myths , inspiration and all of the human imagination have been produced since the beginnings of consciousness since the beginnings .
the ethnosphäre is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are , and what we &apos;re able to do as amazing species .
and as much as the biosphere was stark , it happened with the ethnosphäre -- just with greater speed .
a biologist would say to say that 50 percent or more of all species are about extinction , because it &apos;s simply not true , and yet , this one -- the apokalyptischste in the field of biological diversity -- is hardly what we &apos;re known as optimistischstes szenarium in the field of cultural diversity .
and the entscheidende of that is extinction .
when any of you in this room was born , there were 6,000 languages .
now , a language is not just the sum of the vokabulars or a series of grammatikregeln .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means that finds the soul of a certain culture access to the tangible world .
each language is like a altbestehender forest in the mind , a turning point , a thought , a ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and from those 6,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , half half the ears are geflüstert by children .
they won &apos;t be taught anymore anymore . that means if nothing is done , they &apos;re already dead .
what could be lonely than the silence , one of the last of your people who speak your language , no way to have no way to have the wisdom of the ancestors or to expect the hope ?
and yet , this terrible destiny actually happens to someone somewhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , one of the elderly dies , and it takes the last silben of an old language to the grave .
and i know that some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place , if we all say a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s have this language . let &apos;s be kantonesisch .
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
and then you would suddenly see how it would be if you didn &apos;t speak your own language .
and so i &apos;d like to take you a journey today through the ethnosphäre , a short journey through the ethnosphäre , to try to understand you what &apos;s actually lost .
now there are some of us who forget that , in some sense , when i say , &quot; different possibilities of being his , &quot; really different possibilities of his being .
so , for example , for example , this kid in the northwest part of the amazon , the people of the amazon , believe that they mythologisch the milchfluss from the east in the belly of saint snakes .
this is a people who is not cognitively between the color and green and green , because the forest is on the forest that people depend on .
they have a strange language , and a heiratsvorschrift that &apos;s called the linguistic exogamie : you have to marry someone who &apos;s a different language .
all of this in the mythologischen past , which seems to be about these big houses , because of the mischehen of six or seven languages , though , is that you never hear somebody who learns a language .
they just listen and start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the waorani in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people who kontaktiert the first year friedlich .
in 1957 , in 1957 , there were five missionare in 1957 , and made a schwerwiegenden mistake .
they threw glänzende photographs of themselves from the air , which we have as friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people had never seen from the rainforest in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see the character or to see the character , and they didn &apos;t find this business business of the devil and killed the five missionare with the spear .
but the waorani didn &apos;t just kill the spear .
they durchbohrten each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened by durchbohrungen .
we followed the geneaologie eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death and when we nachdruck people with nachdruck something about it , they gave them to that one of the people were so old that he died because of his ages , and we killed him with the spear .
but at the same time , they have a clear knowledge of forests that was amazing .
their jäger could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps , and determine what animal species owned .
i got a really amazing task when my professor asked me if my professor at harvard when i was interested in to go to haiti and the secret societies , which the foundation of the strength of duvalier and tonton macoutes and tonton and the poison that was used to be used to make zombies .
in order to give a sense of that , of course , , of course , i had to think about this remarkable thing about this remarkable remarkable belief , and voodoo is not a kult of the black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex kind of metaphysische worldview worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask you , the big world world , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , judaismus or whatever .
a continent is left out , because the idea was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious faith , of course , there was one and voodoo of this very profound of this very profound religious thoughts that during the tragic diaspora in the sklavereizeit diaspora .
but what &apos;s really interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living give birth of the spirits .
the minds can be heraufbeschwört from the big water , answers to the rhythm of dance to verdrängen the soul of the living , so that the akolyth for a brief moment is going to god .
deshab like to say , &quot; you know , you go to church and talk about god .
we &apos;re dancing in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to take your mind . how can you be done ?
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo-akolythen in a trancezustand , the glühende coal without combustion anfassend , an amazing visualization of the mind to influence the body that this is aushält when it comes into a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all the people that i met , the kogi from the sierra marta de marta in nordkolumbien , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the old tyrannischen civilization that bevölkerten the heart of the heart of colombia , and in the episode , in the people , they moved to this people in a isoliertes massiv , which is about the karibischen küstenebene .
in a blutbefleckten continent , these people were the only ones that were never erobert .
by the day , you know , you &apos;re governed by a ritual , which is the education , though , is very extraordinary .
the young akolythen are separated at the age of three and four years , in the front of the glacier at 18 years of the glacier of the glacier of the glacier for 18 years , in steinhütten on the front of the glacier for 18 years , chosen , for the nine years of pregnancy that they spent in their leiblichen mother &apos;s lap now , they spend metamorphorisch in the lap of the great mother .
and during this time , they &apos;re introduced to the values of their society , values values that their prayers that their prayers , and their prayers , the cosmic -- or we might say that ecological -- balance .
and at the first time , in your life , in the age of the first light , when the sun starts to be , at the first time , when the sun starts to take the first light in your life , and at the first time , you see , in the age of 18 years , you &apos;ll suddenly see what you have learned in the abstract and the priest , and the priests , and the priests comes back and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really how i told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
and whenever we think about eingeborene and landscape , we either beschwören , and the old video of the fancy wilden , which is a rassistischer thought , or saying , and say , these people are connected to nature , than we .
so , eingeborene aren &apos;t sentimental , they &apos;re not going to be geschwächt by the nostalgie .
it &apos;s not a lot of space for this in the malariaverseuchten sümpfen of asmat or the cold winds of tibet or the cold winds of the earth , which doesn &apos;t be shaped in the idea of being aware of it , but in a far more subtileren intuition intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist because it becomes the human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little bit of a child that believe is a little child , which is a little child , and a different relationship to this resource or this place , as a little child , as a little child from montana , who believe up in the belief that a mountain is a whole bunch of stones that can be abgetragen .
whether he &apos;s a aufenthaltsort of a mind or a bunch of erz , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defined the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of britisch colombia and believed that these forests are there to be gerodet .
that made me another person when my friends , who believe that these forests forests of aufenthaltsort and the gebogenen are himmelsschnabel and the kannibalischen spirits , who are in the nordende of the world , minds that they would participate in their hamatsa-initiation .
well , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can make different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph that i just took in the last last april .
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard , the most powerful psychoaktive preparation from the repertoire of the schamanen .
it &apos;s not just the most amazing potential potential of this präparats , but it &apos;s not just the most amazing potential , which is a number of betakarbolinen potential , but it &apos;s not just the most amazing potential , which is a number of blauer , and it &apos;s a little bit like a blue trüber smoke smoke in your consciousness , but it &apos;s going to be with the leaves of a strauchs in the family &apos;s family with the name of psychotria viridis .
this plant contains a lot of very strong tryptamine that serotonin and methoxydimethyltryptamin are very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the yanomami , as you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this substance that you made from different ways , it also contains methoxydimethyltryptamin .
this powder is kind of schnupfen from a gewehrlauf shot , gesäumt &apos;s paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it will not be erzeugt of reality , but the resolution of reality .
and i even with my professor , richard evan shultes , the man who has started the psychedelische ärea with the discovery mushrooms of mexico in the 30iger years , and i said that you could not be able to be able to be able to do this as a halluzinogen , because the moment in the moment you feel the effects , you &apos;re not there to experience a halluzination .
but the thing about tryptaminen is that they &apos;re not going to be taken eingenommen by a human gut in the human gut , of course , with the name of monoamin-oxidase , denaturiert .
you can only be taken in connection with some other chemicals , which mao denaturieren .
now the fascinating thing is that the betakarboline that are in the liane , mao-inhibitoren from exactly the kind of the way that is necessary to potenzieren , ask yourself .
how can these people get out of any of 80,000 species of adstringierender plants that we find these two morphologisch plants that , if they put together in this way , a kind of biochemischer version , so that the whole greater than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trial and mistakes , which turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask the indians to say , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the cofan , have 17 varieties of ayahuasca , which you all see at great distance in the forest , which is a way of our eyes .
and then you ask them how they took their taxonomie and they say , &quot; i thought you understand about plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you take any of the 17 varieties at vollmond , and you &apos;re singing to one in a different tonlage .
now , that doesn &apos;t bring you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting .
now , the problem- problem is that even those of us who have sympathie for the difficult position of native capital , they &apos;re as orginiell and farbenfroh , but they kind of kind of the past the past , as the real world , that means of our world .
so , in the fact , it &apos;s the fact that you &apos;re going to remember the 20th century , in 300 years , but more than an era where we were in and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth either active unterstützten or passive , so the problem is not the change .
all cultures have involved in the dance with new lebenmöglichkeiten .
and the problem is not the technology .
the sioux-indianer stopped being less on sioux , when they stop and arrow , when the americans stopped being americans when the americans stopped being americans as they were horse and pferdewagen tasks .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of ethnosphäre , and it &apos;s power . the ugly face of rule .
and as you can find that these cultures have been verdrängt , and these are dynamic living peoples , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to see in the flussufer of the südostasien , which is , in southeast of asia , and you can find that these cultures are verdrängt in the horizon , which is ready to see their schiffsräume with raw baumstämmen , who are willing to put on the forest with raw baumstämmen , which they have entrissen the forest , or as in the case of the yanomami , where they &apos;re krankheitsträger that were wurden during the goldrauschs .
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i get a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the phyische extinction of people is verurteilt in general , but the ethnozid , the destruction of the people , not just verurteilt , but in general and vielerorts as part of a entwicklungsstrategie .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering if you haven &apos;t experienced it at unterster .
and i had 6,000 miles from chengdu in westchina überland through südost-tibet überland in westchina , and it was just when i came up with a young colleague of chengdu überland in westchina , and i saw the face of the statistics of the statistics . 6,000 virgin holy monuments that were turned into schutt and verwandelt , 1.2 million people who were murdered during the kadern cultural revolution .
the father of this young manns was identified as a followers lama .
that meant he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle bug with her holiness brought into the diaspora people brought to nepal .
his mother was locked up , as a punishment for the crime .
he was in the age of two years in the prison to hide their rockzipfel , because they couldn &apos;t live .
the sister who did this brave did was beging into a erziehungslager .
one day , they put them on a armband , and for these übertretung , she had to go for seven years .
the suffering can be unerträglich , but the erlösende spirit of people &apos;s mind is something unvergessliches .
and at the end , we really have a choice . we want to do we want to live in a monochromatischen world of monotonie , or in a polychromatischen world of diversity ?
margaret mead , the great anthropologist , before she died , that it &apos;s the greatest anthropologist , which is the big anthropologist , as she died of all the range of human imagination , we can &apos;t only reduce the entire bandwidth of human imagination , but that we had to wake up a dream of a dream , and forget that there was ever other possibilities .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species has existed for 600,000 years .
the neolithische revolution that brought us , in this moment , in this moment , in this moment of saatkorns , the poetry of the priesterschaft , through the priesterschaft and hierarchy of hierarchy , specialization -- was only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all the answers to the challenges we &apos;re in the next millennia .
if we ask these unzähligen weltkulturen of human questions , they answer to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to become the possibility of what we are : people with full consciousness that are the importance of the importance of all people and gardens can flourish to be able to be zugesichert , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took in the northern end of the baffin-inseln , when i was working with inuits , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government has not always been very good at the time , and during the 50iger years of the etablierung of our rule , they were forced to draw in settlements .
the grandfather refused to do this old man .
the family that were afraid of his life took him all the guns and all the tools .
now , you know , you know that there was no fear of the cold , and they used them to their advantage .
the gleitschienen of their schlitten were originally made out of fish in karibu-haut .
the man &apos;s grandfather didn &apos;t fear from the arctic night or the wehenden storm .
he schlüpfte out , he made his pants down , and defäkierte in his hand , and when the feces began to frieren , he shaped it into the form of a messers .
and he was gefroren to the sides of the fäkalien-messers , and when it was completely frozen , he erstach a dog .
he enthäutete the dog and improvisierte a dishes , the skeleton of the dog &apos;s skeleton , and improvisierte a schlitten , spannte , a anderen , and entschwand about the eisschollen on the gürtel .
you can &apos;t do anything like that .
and this is a symbol in many ways a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all native people in the world .
the canadian government gave the full control in april april in 1999 , which is bigger than california and texas together .
it &apos;s our new country and heißt .
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control mineralvorkommen .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can look and reach with his people .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have traveled to these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not removed at all .
they &apos;re the heimatländer of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that are zurückreichen in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children are part of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is we think politicians will never do something .
we believe that polemik -- we think that storytelling is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world , and our website get 35 million hits every month .
liz nations send our fernsehkanal .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we &apos;re going to take a series of travel in the ethnosphäre that we &apos;re going to take our audience to places like that , where we &apos;re going to take the audience from these cultural questions that we &apos;re going to take with the audience of anthropology , which is that this world has made it , in different ways that we can find a lebensmöglichkeit in a really multicultural pluralistischen world where the wisdom of all people can contribute to our shared well-being .
thank you .
so what i mean , as fast as possible as possible , the basic work is , a new technology that we do as part of a übernahme of a year ago , and it &apos;s seadragon , and it &apos;s an environment where you can either be local or away with huge amounts of visual data .
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photographs here that you can nahtlos in , and schwenken , the schwenken , in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of kongressbibliothek , and it &apos;s in a realm of 300 megapixeln .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that can support the performance of a system like this , is the number of pixel on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of nichtbild-daten .
this is bleak house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not about a picture of a picture , we can do something like that to really show that this is a real representation and no image .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a e-buch .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a realistischerer case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a abschnitts .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a magazine or a magazine or reading a newspaper , which is a kind of medium of scale .
we also have some of the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a wrong display with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we added more content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical dictionaries .
and this is actually reaching these ideas , these constraints for the available place on the screen .
we hope that this is not a pop-ups and other nonsense anymore -- that should not be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t really want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re going to do it too .
but these are all roads in the united states .
übereinandergelagert on the top of nasa .
so let &apos;s get something else .
this is actually live on the internet . you can nachprüfen it .
this is a project called photosynth , which is really two different technologies together .
one is a very good research , and the other is a very good research on computervision , who &apos;s from noah snavely , a universitätsstudenten of the university of washington seitz .
and rick szeliski was done by microsoft &apos;s research . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by seadragon .
you can see that if we can penetrate these kinds of views , where we can penetrate through images and make that experience of the mehrfachen resolution resolution .
but the spatial structure of the images is actually what matters .
they put these images together together , and they put these images together in the real room that they were all around the real room , in the kanadischen lakes in the kanadischen , and you can see elements here from stabilisierten slides , and those things , and these things became in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know if i still have time to show you other environments .
there are the ones that are much more räumlicher .
so , i &apos;d like to go straight from datensätze from a noah , and this is from an early prototyp of a noah that we &apos;ve been working on in the summer for the first summer , which i think is that it &apos;s really the punchline behind this technology , and this technology , and this is not necessarily so obvious if you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to make ourselves care about the lawyers .
this is a rekonstruktion of the cathedral , which is out of the computer with images of flickr , and just give it out on flickr on flickr flickr , and you &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts , and so forth , each one of this orange orange , represents an image that was discovered as the model of this model .
so these are all flickr-bilder , and they all stand up in relation to each other .
and we can navigate into this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i will eventually work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for empfang here .
so i guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : everything is about the handy-kamera slrs , a pretty large number of them , a pretty large number of them that were all zusammengeflickt in this environment .
and if you can , i &apos;ll find some of the weird .
many of you are verdeckt of faces .
there &apos;s a series of photographs here -- here you are .
this is actually a poster of notre lady lady , which was really recorded .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with social environment . it &apos;s now all collected from all of the collective collective memory , like , like , visual the earth looks like -- and everything is going to connect .
all of these photographs will connected to each other , and it creates something bigger than the sum of parts .
you get a model that comes from all over the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen lawlers in virtual earth .
and this is something that is through the complexity that people use it , and it &apos;s going to use the benefits to use the user .
their own photographs will come up with metadaten beschildert that a different person .
if someone has done , and all of those things , and all of the sacred , and all of them , my photograph , and i can use them as a starting point , and i can use them as a starting point to come into this room , in these metaverse , the photographs of other people , and use a kind of übergreifender social experience of social experience of social experience .
and of course , byproduct of all this is the immense rich reichen models of every interesting part of every interesting part of every interesting part of any interesting part of any interesting part of the earth , which were receiving not only by überflüge or satellite images , but through collective memory .
thank you .
do i understand , right ? your software allows you to see that at a certain point , within the next few years , all the images that are used by someone in the world is basically associated with each other ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t do anything else .
if you want to create hyperlinks between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and this is really exciting if you think about the fülle of semantischen information that have many of these images .
like , as if you do a websuche for images , where you enter sentences and the text of the website , there &apos;s a lot of information that is .
but how would it be , if you put it up with all your pictures ?
then the range of semantischen querverbindung , and the abundance that comes out of it , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic netzwerkeffekt .
copernicus , that &apos;s really incredible . so , congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , which is how i hope with other things you &apos;ve already heard about , and i &apos;m going to try and make some connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official dogma . &quot;
the official dogma of what ?
the official glaubenssatz of all western industrialized societies .
the official dogma works is that if our goal is to maximize the treatment of the public our citizens , this is especially through the maximierung of the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom is good , valuable , good , a unverzichtbare premise for human human .
when people have freedom , each of us are for themselves to do the things that maximize our good , and nobody has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom you have , and the more freedom you have , the more good you have .
this is , i think , deep in our water supply chain , that there was no sense of it .
and it &apos;s also fixed in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes modern progress .
this is my supermarket . it &apos;s no big .
i just want to say something about salatdressing .
there are 175 dressings in my supermarket , if you can &apos;t buy the 10 different olivenöle , and 12 balsamico-essig that you could buy a large number of your salat dessings dessings , the unlikely case that none of the 175 in the store is right .
so that &apos;s like the supermarket .
and then you go to the verbraucher-elektronik business , a stereo -- speaker , cd-player , ein , verstärker , verstärker , and in this one electronics , there is a lot of stereo facilities .
we can do 6.5 million different stereo facilities from the components that will be offered a business .
you have to admit that this is a big selection .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , and you could have anbieter every phone , as long as long as he came from your ma bell .
you rented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence of it was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we &apos;ve got almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones in the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- mp3-player- , nasen-haar-trimmer and crème brûlée fackel .
and if you haven &apos;t seen this in your business now , you can be sure they &apos;re going to be .
and what it does is bring people to walk into business and ask this question .
now , you know what the answer to this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , which is a lot of bedeutsamer than buying it , the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor says what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor says , you know , we could make a difference , or we could b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has this benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risk .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients . that sounds like a good thing , but in the reality is a shift for the meeting of decisions from someone who knows something -- the doctor &apos;s doctor -- to someone who knows nothing and most likely to be sick , and that &apos;s not in the best constitution to make a decision -- namentlich the patient .
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for people like it and me that , if you think about it , doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they do that if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the answer is , you expect the doctor to call and asking for a change in the next morning .
something like that as much as tiefgreifendes as our identity is a question of choice , like this slide .
we don &apos;t get a identity ; we invent them .
and we &apos;re often erfinden as often as we want .
that means that every day wake up the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where almost everyone had one time , almost everybody had one , and they could , and then they were able to get kids as fast as they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , not what they did .
now , all these days .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work when i used to do .
and not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re busy with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i get married or not ? should i get married now ?
should i marry later ? should i have children , or do i do ? &quot;
these are all einnehmende questions .
and you &apos;ll be able to answer these questions , whether that means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to tell you and not a good grade in my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to beantwortende questions .
work -- we are blessed , as carl shows , with the technology that allows us every minute of every single day to work on the planet -- to the randolph hotel .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , which i &apos;m not going to tell anyone about the wirelesslan work .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have to make decisions , again , again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can look at our kids at soccer , and we have our mobile phone on the one hip and our blackberry to other hip , and our laptop is probably on our lap lap .
and even if you &apos;re shut down , every minute , every minute we verstümmeln our child verstümmeln , we ask ourselves , you know , &quot; should i suppose that call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; is certainly your child &apos;s experience of your child &apos;s experience , very different than it would have been .
wherever we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world where we were living here .
and i want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in that we now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;ll be bad about what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects to people .
an effect , paradoxer way , is that it &apos;s lähmt .
so , with so many options you can vote , people can be very hard to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another drastisches example of that , a study about investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to investitions-akten , the giant fondgesellschaft from about a million employees and about 2,000 jobs .
and what she found was a 10 investmentfonds that der the employer , it took two percent by two percent .
they offer 50 investmentfonds -- 10 percent less employees , as if they only got five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investmentfonds , which is to stand , it &apos;s so hard to decide what you should choose to pick it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never come tomorrow .
you understand that that is not only means that people have to eat food food , because they don &apos;t have enough money , because they don &apos;t have enough money , it means make decisions so hard that they &apos;re missing large investitionsangebote of their employer .
they &apos;re not participation in part of 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the arbeitsgeber , who would have been happy to reproduce .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
and i think it causes the world that looks like this .
you want to make the decision really right when it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or even the wrong salatdressing .
so this is an effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we &apos;re going to end up with the outcome of choice , as if we had the possibility we had to choose between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
so , one of them have been able to make a different decision that would have been better , and what &apos;s happening is that you can make a different decision that would have been better , and what happens is that you can make the decision that makes you feel the decision , and this regrets seems negative to the happiness that you had done from your failure , even if it was a good decision .
the more possibilities that you have , the easier is that there &apos;s nothing to regret for the choice they meet .
secondly , what economists call oppertunitätskosten .
dan gilbert made a big point now by telling how much the way that we evaluate things depends on what we compare .
well , if there is a lot of alternatives , if there is a lot of alternatives , it &apos;s easy to imagine alternatives that you ausschließen , that makes you less satisfied with the alternatives that you &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who don &apos;t have a new yorker , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a few on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great beach . you have it all for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august august .
everyone in my manhattener neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly in front of my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks of the thought that he had missed the opportunity to have missed a great parking lot .
oppertunitätskosten senken the happiness that we get through our choice , even if what we chose is fantastic .
and the more possibilities there are a choice , the more attractive properties of these choices are going to take into the oppertunitätskosten .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon makes some of the stories .
he &apos;s doing a statement about it now and maybe to live things about things .
but an important point that he &apos;s doing is , whenever you decide for one thing , don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things like many attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to do what they &apos;re going to do .
third : eskalation of expectations .
this struck me when i exchange my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in that there were just jeans in that way , and they bought them , and they were schlecht ; they were incredibly unkomfortabel , and if they were carried them long enough , and often enough , they started , &quot; ok .
so , to buy new jeans , for many years of the tragens of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the verkäufer guy said , &quot; do you want to schlanke , easily anliegende or big ?
do you want to buttons or reißverschluss ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
do you want to cut down , kegelig , blah blah blah ... &quot; and so on , he said .
my jaw down , and after i recovered , i would like , &quot; i would like to have the way that used to be the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour of all these damn jeans , and i leave the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best appropriate jeans i ever had .
i had better . all of these choices gave me better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it myself .
the reason that i felt worse , with all these available , with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what makes a good pair of jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have any concrete expectations than it was just in a way .
when you were in 100 ways , damn , one of them should have had perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i was going to get to what i was expecting to do , and what i had was enttäuschend compared to what i was expecting .
the adding opportunities to the lives of people are necessarily increasing expectations of people who are going to be good about how good these possibilities are .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of the marketings knows that , because if you would , you don &apos;t know what it is about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that it was that used to be better than anything worse than anything worse , was it possible for people to make experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world we live in -- we are wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as an expectation -- the best thing you can hope for is things as well as you expect them .
they &apos;re never pleasant überrascht. because their expectations , my expectations , haushoch .
the secret to the glücklichkeit -- that &apos;s what they all came for -- the secret to glücklichkeit are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short autobiographischer moment -- i &apos;m married to a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i don &apos;t have niedergelassen .
but niederlassen is not always such a bad thing .
so , the consequence of the kaufens of a bad sitzenden , if there &apos;s only one way to buy jeans , if you &apos;re unhappy , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear . what would you have to do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and you buy one that &apos;s disappointing , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is , you .
they could have done better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the schaufenster , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions , and even if the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it , they blame themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the last generation in the last generation .
i think a signifikanter -- not the only one , but a signifikanter beiträger to this explosion of depression , and also , is that people have experienced that people are so high because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences themselves , think it would be their fault .
and so this is the bilanzergebnis that it &apos;s generally better to us , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remember you .
this is the official dogma that we all think of it is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there is no question that a choice is better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow the more choice than something more selection .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time to make our greater good .
now , as a policy question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a policy question , the thing about thinking about it , which is what all of these choices is in the industrialized societies , is wealth of wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard many of you know , whose problem is not too big selection .
your problem is that you have too little .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about is a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry is : steve levitt told you yesterday about how these expensive and hard to installierenden car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
they even hurt .
they worry about it &apos;s worse .
if some of what our society is allowing society to make decisions for the societies in the societies where people would have a lot of choice , they wouldn &apos;t only be improving the lives of people , but they would also be improved .
economists call this a pareto-verbesserungs application .
einkommensumverteilung is going to worry that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big choices .
finally , you &apos;re reading this cartoon , and , you can read this cartoon , and you say , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything about it in this goldfischglas . &quot;
verarmten imagination , a kurzsichtige view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
the more i thought about it was , the more i came to the idea that the fish knows something .
because the truth is that if you break the goldfischglas , so that it &apos;s possible , you have no freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the goldfischglas , so it &apos;s all possible , lower happiness .
they increase the paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a goldfischglas .
this is almost as limited security -- maybe for the fish , definitely for us .
but the abhanden of the abhanden is a recipe is a recipe for misery , a recipe for misery , and i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects before , the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we have digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code to a new phase of biology by making new life and building new life .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i believe that a lot of biologists tried to understand , and it &apos;s on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve been digitized nearly 20 years . when we sequenced the humangenom , the shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world .
now , let &apos;s try to ask if we can regenerate or do we live new life from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma geitalium , who has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate themselves in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do this with a even smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it in about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at this metabolische map , which is very simple , compared to this , trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we &apos;re all going to look at these genes we can look at one after the other , it &apos;s very unlikely that it would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way in the front of this chromosome , in fact , which allows us to vary the individual components and make some of those fundamental questions .
and so we started the question , can we synthetisieren a chromosome ?
does it allow the chemistry to create these really big molecules , which hasn &apos;t been done before ?
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of inertes chemical material .
our steps in the digitalisierung of life were exponentially .
and our ability to write genetic code has evolved very slowly , but we &apos;ve got our last point to be on an exponential curve now .
we &apos;ve started this 15 years ago .
it took a few years ago , in fact , before we did the first experiments .
it turns out it turns out is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a degenerativer process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new method that we could build these little pieces and could make the mistakes .
that was our first trial , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x arrived .
it &apos;s a small virus of bacteria .
we made little pieces , made a fehlerkorrektur , and had a dna of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of inerte chemical chemical and put the bacteria in a bacterium , and the bacteria began to read the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were freigegeben by the cells , and they came back and killed e. e. .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they told this model that model .
they laughed more than her here .
so we think that this is a situation in software that actually can build your hardware hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to make a lot further . we wanted to build an entire bakterielles chromosome , and we wanted to do a whole bakterielles chromosome , so we thought we &apos;re building it in kassetten from the size of the virus where we could vary the size of the kassetten to understand what the individual components of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information needs to be really accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the fehlerrate was fehlerrate in a mistake per 10,000 base .
we found the resequenzieren 30 mistakes , and when we used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to make pieces that have the 50 letters long , and you need to do with other 50-buchstaben , to build smaller sub-einheiten to make them fit .
we &apos;ve got unique elements in here .
you may have heard that we have waterzeichen built .
think about this : we have a 4-buchstaben code : a , c , g and t. t. .
triplets of these letters -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
at first , we just signed signed .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we &apos;ve engineered the pieces that we could easily break them up with enzymes . there are enzymes that repair this and together .
and we &apos;ve started making pieces , starting with pieces of the five to siebentausend letters , they put them together in order to make 24.000-buchstaben-stücke , to put them together , to 72.000 .
in every step , we have these pieces of these pieces that , because we were trying to create a very robust process of what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of automation .
so , it looks like a basketball-playoff .
if we get to these very big pieces -- with 100,000 basenpaaren -- then that &apos;s not just going to grow in e. coli . it goes beyond all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we applied to other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of homologe rekombination rekombination that uses biology to repair dna that can put these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s an organism called deinococcus radiodurans of the three million wheel on radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything has been put together again as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely ausgetrocknet , they can actually live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life exists in space and move , looking for aquatischen conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot out there .
so here &apos;s a gefügeaufnahme of the molecule we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- in fact , we &apos;ve only used hefe-mechanismen using the right design with the right design , we &apos;ve got to do yeast it automatically together .
this is not a elektronenmikroskopaufnahme mikroskopaufnahme .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the lichtmikroskop .
this is footage over a duration of six seconds .
that &apos;s the paper we &apos;ve been doing recently .
these are about 580.000 code in genetischem code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with definierter structure that has ever been created by people .
it has a molekulargewicht of over 300 million .
if we put it with a schriftgröße of 10 and no distances , it would include 142 pages , just about this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it is that it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier if you &apos;re in eukaryonten like we &apos;re doing , you just take the nucleus out and there &apos;s another one in it , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about cloning cloning .
in archaebakterien , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but just recently we &apos;ve shown that you can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from a cell to the other , and can activate it .
and we &apos;ve got some extra-gene on this chromosome , that we could pick up this chromosome , roughly that we could pick up the chromosome to destroy all the proteins , and it was really amazing when we gave it into a cell -- and they &apos;re going to give us our very ausgereiften graphs here -- and they &apos;re going to estimate our very ausgereiften graphics .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to make the process further .
this is the hauptmechanismus of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here that have a second chromosome , or a third of irgendwoher , every given thousands of characteristics in just one second to a species .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that is changed at a time , a lot of biology .
there are enzymes that are actually called the restriktionsenzyme that are actually verdauen dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell . the chromosomes we &apos;ve added .
it was exprimiert in the cell , and we realized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and that &apos;s what we ended up with a new chromosome .
it was blue because of the genes we had put in .
and after a very short time , there had all the characteristics of species lost of species , and konvertierte completely in a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we have transferiert .
it likes to sound like genomic alchimie , but we can , by changing the software-dna , things pretty dramatic .
now , i argued that this is not the genesis -- this is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i &apos;ve argued that we may be able to create a new explosion in which there &apos;s massive new new artenbildung based on that digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re at nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet has existed for everyone in the year , within the year ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have trouble with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
it becomes a challenge for 9 .
we need about five billion tons of coal , 30-plus billion barrels of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million barrels a day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there is the whole co2 co2 of this material ends up in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the designkomponenten of the future .
the elektronikindustrie had a dozen components and look at the diversity that came out of it .
we &apos;re looking at first of the boundaries of biological reality of biological reality .
we have technologies today because of these fast synthesemethoden , to do what we call kombinatorische genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine putting these 20 million different genes , or to make these processes , to create oktan or new vaccines new vaccines , we can change with a only small team than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just nurmale selection . we can nach selektieren , production of chemicals or treibstoffproduktion , and so on .
this is a wirklicher design-software on that we &apos;re working in , which you actually sit and hinsetzen new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it looks like it . we know exactly how their genetic code will look .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth of the fourth generation .
they have recently seen ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we &apos;ve got fuels of the zweiten- and third generation that are going to be much higher zuckerwertigkeiten , like oktan or different kinds of butanol .
but as we think , the only way of biology is to the cost of the cost of food , or the limitation of the availability of food , is when we see co2 as a starting material , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that go to this way .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first with treibstoffen the fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about ein-einhalb miles deep , at nearly kochenden wassertemperaturen .
it &apos;s changing co2 in methane using hydrogen as a source of energy .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use gespeichertes co2 co2 , which could just be brought into produktionsplätzen the co2 in the fuel to power that process .
within a short period of time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we have really -- moderate goals like the ersatz of the whole petrochemischen industry , right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? a hauptquelle of energy .
but also , in the same way , we &apos;re working on the same way to use the vaccines .
you saw it this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year of it , and you have a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that it can be changed by rekombinante vaccines in the vorhinein .
this is what the future might look like with changes , can be accelerating today with synthetic bacteria , archaen , and perhaps eukaryonten .
we &apos;re improving light years from it to improve people . our goal is that we have a chance to survive for a long enough to do that . thank you very much .
on the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to tell you how the machine works .
so now it &apos;s like this . and for all those who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment that has ever been considered -- 27 miles across .
his job is to create the conditions less than a milliardstel second at the beginning of the universe -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine underneath the geneva .
we take images of these mini-urknalle in detectors .
this is where i work . it &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 feet in the diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas that you see the scale .
last september year , the machine was the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it has huge jubel jubel in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first strahlenpartikels that the entire track of the lhc , and then it &apos;s a part of the lhc lhc to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this image on september 10th , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was the largest jubel , or that , when someone was visiting the google side , and i found the front page .
it means that we had a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that i had to do with these wires here .
these wires leiten wenn when the machine goes on hochleistung .
now , the engineers under you will look at them and say , &quot; no , don &apos;t do that . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you cool them down , they &apos;re going to be called supraleitern .
so at minus 271 degrees , cooler than the room between the stars , they can maintain that tension .
in one of the connections , between über magnets in the lhc , there was a manufakturdefekt .
and by putting the wires together , the wires and 13-tausend and 13-tausend ampere resistance .
this was the result .
well , it &apos;s all wonderful when you imagine that the magnets weigh over 20 tons and move around about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we did .
we neu them , they reparierten .
now you &apos;re all back on your way .
by march , the lhc will be funktionsfähig .
we &apos;re going to turn it up , and expect the first data in june june of july , and take our journey to figure out what the blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , in some kind of entfachen such accidents , the value of science and ingenieurskunst on the borders , it &apos;s easy to reject something like this .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we move beyond our borders , is the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to think that when he was nutzlosen words of a english scientist , humphrey davy davy , who said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of human mind , as to assume that our scientific ideas are good , that there &apos;s no mystery mystery in nature that our triumphe are vollzählig , and that there are no new worlds . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
books is my profession , but of course , it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my great , life and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to ever change .
however , recent is a bit weird in my life , and my career that has been brought me to rethink my relationship with this work .
and this strange thing was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called „ eat , pray , love -- that i decided to be different than all my previous books for some reason , for some reason , and a big mega-ereignis , international internationales .
the result is that , no matter where i &apos;m going to be treated as if i &apos;m going to be treated .
seriously -- the end of geweiht !
for example , come to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you will never übertreffen this success ?
don &apos;t you worry about her entire life , and never again a book that anyone in the world is interested in the world ?
okay , that &apos;s really the courage .
but it was worse , if i didn &apos;t remember that over 20 years ago , when i first told it about 20 years ago , i wanted to be a writer , with the same kind of angstbesetzter response .
people said , „ did you have no afraid to succeed ?
do you have no fear that kills you the humiliation of a absage ?
don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re doing this craft for your life , and you never get something that you &apos;re going to die , and you &apos;re going to die on a schrotthaufen geplatzter .
it &apos;s about , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : „ .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had it .
and i &apos;ve got a lot more things that nobody was going to do .
as algae -- and other furchteinflößende things .
but when it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it , and i ask : why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that you should be expected to do the work that he feels berufen ?
and what &apos;s going on to the creative project that they &apos;re going to make us insecure geisteszustand -- in a way -- in a way that other jobs don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can &apos;t remember the situation in his 40 years as a chemist that he was asked if he was afraid to be chemists .
with your chemiker-blockade , john -- how are you ?
it just didn &apos;t mean , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists of a chemist didn &apos;t get the reputation &apos;s call manisch-depressive .
so we seem to have this kind of reputation , but not just the writers , but the creative of all genres , they seem to be incredibly incredibly unstable .
everything you have to do is to look at the bitteren of really great minds alone from the 20th century , who died young and often died by their own hand .
and even those who didn &apos;t actually take their own begingen seemed to be really neglected by their talent .
norman mailer said shortly before his death , in his last interview , every one of my books got me a little bit more .
a extraordinary statement that you can do about your work .
but we don &apos;t even zucken , if we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve heard this kind of a long time , and collectively we have the perception of this , and collective accepted that creativity and suffering somehow , of course , zusammengehören , and that art -- at the end of the end -- always leads to the seelenqual .
the question i &apos;d like to ask today is this idea : is this idea that this idea ?
do you feel that ? because with only one inch , i don &apos;t feel like i think of this notion .
i think of them .
and i find them dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to watch them taking over the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we encourage our great creative creative .
and i definitely know that it would be for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start this dark path of guess the idea , sort of herunterzusickern -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career in my career .
this is -- you see , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 arbeitsjahre in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to be doing now in writing from the world as the work is going to be on the world after my last book , right ?
i &apos;m going to say it geradeheraus , because we &apos;re all of friends -- it &apos;s most likely that my greatest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thought that can bring someone to drink nine at 9 o &apos;clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want that .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time , i seems to me that i can continue to write a kind of schützendem psychological construction .
so , somehow i have to find a way to write a safe distance of a distance between me , and my very natural beklemmung of how the reaction is going to the writing .
in the past year i have been looking for models to do this , and i &apos;ve been looking for models in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if you might have better or vernünftigere ideas about that as we can help , how to help the emotional risks with the emotional risks that are connected to creativity .
and this quest led me to old greece and old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will end up again .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they thought that creativity was a kind of göttlicher diener-geist , which was from a distant , unknown source source to people -- from unerklärlichen , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this divine diener-geister of creativity dämonen dämonen .
now , from socrates socrates he believed that he would have a dämon that weisheiten him from away .
the roman had the same idea , this kind of körperlosem creative spirit called a „ genius .
that &apos;s great . the roman didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical göttliches being , which was believed that it lives literally in the walls of a künstlerateliers -- sort of like dobby , the hauself -- the rauskäme and the artist , in some sense , invisible , invisible and the result of work .
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from your work of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artist of the altertums was a certain kind of things , like , for example , for example , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t be able to look at it all for you . everybody knew that you had this körperlose genius that helped you .
if your work is floppte -- not entirely your mistake , right ?
everybody knew your genius was something paralyzed .
so , people in the west really have thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance came . we had this big idea . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual at the center of the universe -- about all the gods and mystery , and there is no room for the mystic creatures that take orders from the divine .
it &apos;s the start of the rational and people started to believe that creativity came completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people this or the artists call a genius of a genius -- instead of having a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think that he &apos;s thinking , or she &apos;s like the vessel , and the essence and the essence and the essence of all of the divine creative creative , unbekanntem , infinite mysteriums is a little too much a little responsibility to a fragilen , human psyche .
it &apos;s like asking someone to eat the sun .
the entstellt and the verzerrt whole , and it creates all these unerreichbaren expectations of success .
i think that this is erfolgs-druck our artists over the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- the question is .
can we change it ?
perhaps to an ancient understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just auslöschen rational volts from a 18-minütigen talk for 500 years .
and there are certainly people in this audience , the really berechtigte scientific doubt about the notion of -- basically -- grundsätzlich , the people nachfolgen and apply to their projects and so forth .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to do is , why not ?
why not think about it ?
because it makes a lot of sense of everything that i heard , if it was about explaining the absolutely crazy crazy machende of the creative process .
a process that -- as anyone knows that it &apos;s ever trying to do something -- so in other words , everybody here -- not always behave .
in fact , he can feel really paranormal .
now , i had an encounter like that i had this extraordinary american poet , which is now about 90 , who was now about 90 , and she told me that when i was growing up in the fields , he was growing up on the fields , and she said , she would feel , she would feel like a poem about the landscape on them .
she said it would be like a donnernder train .
that &apos;s what the land was going on .
she felt if it came because it would bring the earth under your feet .
she knew that she was able to do a moment , and that was -- in her words , „ running like the devil .
she ran like the devil was verfolgt by this poem , and it was only about that she had to get fast enough to a piece of paper and a pen , so they had to capture it through it through them and to capture it on the sheet .
in other things , she wasn &apos;t fast . she ran and ran , and she ran and ran and ran , and she verpasste through it , and she verpasste it . she said it , she would keep moving on country , and -- as she said -- „ after another poet , looking for a different poet .
and then there were these moments -- i will never forget about -- she said that these moments were in which they were almost missed it .
so , it &apos;s running for the house and looking for paper , and she &apos;s looking through paper , and she takes a pen through it , and then she takes a pen -- she said -- it was as if it was going to reach and put it up with your other hand .
they caught the poem in its tail , and she pulled it back into her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
in those opportunities , the poem came up and intact on paper -- but backwards -- the last word for the first word .
when i heard that , i thought that i was creepy -- this is exactly how my creative process is going on .
that &apos;s not at all my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a maultier . i have to be able to get up every day at the same time and sweat , i &apos;m wirklich and rather uncomfortable .
but even i have this thing in my maultierart sometimes .
and i guess many of you have done that .
even i &apos;ve been working or ideas that i can &apos;t identify from a source of me that i really can &apos;t identify .
what is this for one thing ?
and how do we deal with it without losing our minds , but actually to keep us in the opposite health ?
for me , the best living example of how you can do this is the musicians of tom waits . i was allowed to interview him a few years ago .
we talked about this issue . and you know what ? the most of his life was tom the embodiment of gepeinigten modern modern artist , who was trying to master these unkontrollierbaren creative impulse that lived in him , and with them .
but then he got older and quiet . he told me that one day he went on a schnellstraße schnellstraße , and that &apos;s where everything changed for him .
he &apos;s going to hear a little fragment of a melody when he suddenly hear a little fragment of a melody , which is quälend hard to him , and he wants to have it . it &apos;s prachtvoll . he &apos;s lechzt after , but he can &apos;t believe it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a kassettenrekorder .
so he begins , this old beklemmung in him , like , like , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be verfolgt by that song .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it .
but instead of getting panic , he just stopped .
he ended up all the mindset and did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky and said , &quot; excuse me , can &apos;t you see that i drive car ?
i &apos;m looking at this as if i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come to a günstigeren moment when i can take care of you .
if not , you know , somebody else else .
go and quäle leonard cohen .
his whole arbeitsprozess has changed .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as ever .
but the process and the heavy beklemmung that surrounds him was no longer when he was a genius , where he was doing nothing in trouble , and then the zurückließ where he was kind of coming from . he realized that it had to be a verinnerlichtes thing .
it could be a eigentümliche , surprising , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the fremdartigen , meaningful thing that was not very tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a bit of the way i worked , and once saved me .
and this idea , when i was in the middle of „ eat , pray pray , pray , love , i fell in one of these gruben , in which we all fall , when we &apos;re working on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster . this is the worst book ever written .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just einstampfen the project .
but then i remembered how tom had spoken to the freien , and i tried it .
so i raised my view of manuscript , and i spoke to my comment towards an empty corner of space .
i said loud : listen , you know , you know , you and i both know if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i have everything i have , investing . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to get it better , you have to pop up here and your percentage of deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what the hell do .
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to go on the record that i was going to be here today .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like following . in the end , centuries , in the deserts nordafrikas people have gathered into mondscheinfesten people with sacred dances and music who were gathered for hours -- to dawn .
these were always great , because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , something special happened . one of the characters actually became überweltlich .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know that you &apos;ve all seen this in your life in your life .
it was like the time , and the dancers are through some kind of pforte , and he did nothing different than he has done before -- 1,000 nights nights before , but it was all together .
and all of all of a sudden , it &apos;s no longer seemed to be human .
it was erhellt up in the inside , and the bottom , and all erhellte through a göttliches fire fire .
when something happened then , people , people knew what that was . they called it on his name .
they put their hands together and started singing : „ allah , allah , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historic fußnote : when the mohren südspanien moved , they took these practice in the course of „ allah , allah , allah , “ , olé olé , olé olé , olé “ , olé “ , which you still hear about stierkämpfen and flamenco-tänzen .
if an actor in spain in spain has something to do : „ allah , olé , olé , olé , großartig , bravo , well done , well , done , it is : a flüchtiger look at god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but , the tricky part of the next morning , if the dancers wake up and realize that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock in a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer a fünkchen of god .
it &apos;s just a alternder sterblicher with schmerzenden knees , and maybe he will never be able to go up again .
and maybe even again , someone &apos;s name of god &apos;s name , when he turns out , but what would he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the schmerzhaftesten korrekturen of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be as much as pein if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence came from you .
if you may just believe that you &apos;re a loan -- from a unvorstellbaren source for a erlesene period of your life that &apos;s passed on someone else , if you &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and i think of security in the past months , while i was working on the book that &apos;s going to seem soon -- as the dangerous , frightening , very well expected to my abgefahrenen &apos;s success .
what i have to say to myself is , if i &apos;m going to talk about it , i &apos;m not afraid of it .
not entmutigt .
just make your job .
continue to be there , whatever it is .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the stupid divine genius that you &apos;re looking at the side is deciding , you know , for a moment , for a moment , , for a moment , zeigen .
and if not , dance , even dance your dance .
and „ olé ! “ for you despite all of this .
i believe it , and i feel that we should teach .
„ olé ! “ for you despite all of all of all of this , just for that you have the mere human love and the eigensinn to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
olé !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic eiskappe , which was eiskappe for nearly three million years , the size of the lower 48 states to have 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t press very strong enough the seriousness of this particular problem because it &apos;s not the thickness of the ice .
in a certain sense , the arctic eiskappe is the beating heart of our global klimasystems .
it grows in the winter and schrumpft in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a zeitrafferaufnahme what happened in the last 25 years .
the dauereis is labeled with red .
as you can see , it grows on the dunkelblau . this is the annual ice ice in the winter ; it &apos;s schrumpft in summer .
it &apos;s called dauereis , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which is herausfliesst from the body .
in 25 years it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
this is a problem , because warming is the frozen basis of the frozen cause to the arctic ocean , where there are huge amounts of gefrorenem carbon , which if it auftaut , it &apos;s done from microbes .
compared to the entire amount of klimaverändernden materials in the atmosphere , that amount could double double if we can cross that critical point .
today , there are sprudelt in some flat lakes , in some shallow methane from itself from itself .
professor katey walter at the university , in alaska , with another group in another flat sea last winter .
wow !
you &apos;re fine . the question is , how is it ergehen us .
and one reason is , this enormous heat heat out of the north .
this is a jährlicher tauwasserfluss .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is the kangerlussuaq flow river in the southwest .
if you want to know how the sea level goes up here , they &apos;re going to go up to the sea .
these rivers take a rapid .
the other end of the planet , antarctica , antarctica , the largest eismasse on the planet .
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent is now a negative eisbilanz .
and the westantarktis that showed across a few unterwasserinseln is especially in the melt .
this is like 20 feet , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the drittgrössten eismasse , you see the new lakes that were glaciers a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their trinkwassers .
in the nucleus , this glacier is the trinkwasserquelle for this city .
the wassermengen have been expanding .
but if it versiegen , most of drinking water will be wegfallen .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in the schneedecke of the schneedecke of sierra .
this is the speicherbecken .
and the predictions of how they read them are serious .
that austrocknung in the entire world leads to a dramatic increase on fire .
and the disasters around the world have really ausserordentlichen , and it &apos;s never an unprecedented extent .
in the last 30 years as many of the last 30 years .
this is a completely unhaltbares entwicklungsmuster .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it anrichtet .
in the last five years we have produces 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours of co2 every 24 hours every day in the oceans .
so , look at the area of the eastern pacific , from the american continent and beiderseits and beiderseits of indian subkontinents , where there is a radical decline of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , besides deforestation deforestation , which is 20 percent is burning by fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the nonetheless biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest verschmutzer , with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot more kohlefabriken .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that were taken out over the last few years with some green alternatives that have been proposed .
trotzdessen is a political argument in our country .
and the kohleindustrien and ölindustrien have spent a viertelmilliarde dollar last kalendarjahr to put clean clean coal , which is already a contradiction .
this picture reminded me about something .
around christmas day , at me at home , in tennessee , in tennessee , a billion tons of kohleschlamm .
you saw it warscheinlich in the news .
this is in our entire country of the zweitgrösste abfallfluss of america .
this happened to christmas christmas .
one of the commercials of the kohleindustrie for christmas was that .
frosty of kohlenmann is a vergnügter kid .
it &apos;s in the skin and abundance of america , and it helps to grow our economy .
frosty , the kohlenmann is clean every day .
it &apos;s affordable and liebenswert and workers stay in lohn and bread .
this is the source of most of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful bergarbeiter is the ladder of massey coal .
and let me say a very clearly . al gore , nancy pelosi pelosi , harry reid , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance of climate protection started to life .
this is one , part of it .
we see climate change as a serious threat for our business .
that &apos;s why we put it on the top of the top of the zeil , to spend a significant geldsumme on the way to get a werbeaktion on the way to get the truth on coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and also smells good .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let &apos;s just leave that .
saueber coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean kohlefabrik .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean kohletechnologie .
and yet , the burning of one of the main reasons for global warming is the global warming , which is remarkable clean kohletechnologie that you see here changes .
look at it &apos;s right now , this is today , clean kohletechnologie .
finally , positive alternative to our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that all of these connects connects is our dependence on kohlenstoff-basierenden fuels like dirty coal and ausländisches oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us from this misslichen .
versorge america with 100 percent clean electricity , within the next 10 years , within the next 10 years .
a plan to bring america back to work , to make us safer and help to stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
versorge america is new . find more out .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a neuversorgung of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on ancient , negative fuels , ersticken our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create good successful jobs .
versorge america &apos;s new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we have to come far , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
so i &apos;d like to start to start asking you for the time of your childhood when you were playing with bauklötzen .
while they realized how to reach the hands and ausstreckt the klötze , and moved , they actually learned to think and understand problems through understanding the understanding of the world .
the spatial thing is deeply connected to how we understand most of our environment .
so , as a computer scientist -- by the kind of our interaction with real objects -- inspired by the kind of interaction in the kind of our interaction with real objects , i started to wonder : ... what if we were using computers on a flat arbeitsfläche -- ... what if we could intervene with both of the hands with both hands and take data in the way that we could do it ?
this question was so clear that we decided to explore the answer and developed siftables .
in short , an interactive computer is an interactive computer in the size of a kekses .
you can move with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can capture your movements , and you have a screen and a funkempfänger .
more importantly , is physically physically , so you can only move through the reach of your hands and access .
and the siftables are an example of a new generation of hilfsmitteln to manipulation digital data .
and if these tools are becoming physical and awareness for their movements , they can recognize each other and see each other , and see the intricacies of our umgangs with them , then we can start studying new and more sophisticated interaktionsarten .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
this siftable is for the videowiedergabe konfiguriert , and if i put it in a direction , the video will play forward , if i kippe it in the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits take up each other .
so if i put them side-by-side , they make their interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by voneinader , you &apos;ll notice that , and you can get a little nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and slope .
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to see was that we could apply common gestures on data , like color , like the color , as you do that with fluid .
in this case , we have three siftables as farbtöpfe konfiguriert , and i can use them to pour color in the middle where they &apos;re going to mix .
if we go ahead it , we can do a little bit .
there are also some nice opportunities in education like languages , math or logikspiele , where we give people the possibility of fast trial and see the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci numbers that i &apos;m erstelle with a simple gleichungsprogramm .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle .
and basically , you have every round of siftable letters , and as you try to form words , you &apos;re going to be tested words .
then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s mixed again , and you have a new buchstabenkombination and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are a couple of kids on a trip to the media lab , and i was able to make them , and have a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact in this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
everything you have to say is &quot; you build words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here are some people who test it .
this is our youngest beta-tester at the bottom right there .
it turns out he just wanted to stack the siftables .
so for him , they were just bauklötze .
this is an interactive trickfilmanwendung .
we wanted to develop a lernmittel for sprachlerner .
that &apos;s felix .
he can bring new characters into the scene by aufhebt the siftable of the table that shows this character .
here he lets the sun rise .
the sun goes on .
now he &apos;s catching up to the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
when he shake the siftables , he can be able to interact with the characters ...
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story to open , and it can decide how to evolve .
flying cat .
the last example , for me today , to show it , is a musik-sequencer for live-auftritte , which we &apos;ve developed recently , and as sound , like führungsstimme , bass and drums .
each has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can turn in certain patterns .
and you put them up by just having a ton-siftable to a sequenz-siftable .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filter .
you put it together with a certain tone and then tends to hire it .
and then larger effects like speed and volume that you use the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we start , in which we &apos;re going to go into two sequenz-siftable and put this in a row , you expand and add a little more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to really do something else .
and now i combine the filters with the drums so that i can use the effect live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by the pace of one or another direction .
and now i combine the filters with the bass , for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as it &apos;s going .
so , i don &apos;t have to do it in front , but i can improvise it ; it can make it .
and finally , i can ausblenden the whole sequence by running the lautstärke-siftable to the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my desire is to develop new mensch-computer-schnittstellen that fit better , how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to give you a part of this new design-welt and some of the possibilities that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i &apos;d like to give you on the way is that we are at the verge of this new generation of werzeugen interaction with digital media that are bringing information to our world that we have .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m looking forward to all the conversation .
yes , good afternoon .
i &apos;m excited that i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what should biohacking be ?
i just have to step back a little step back to the modern molecular biology .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been doing this for a few years now , and i started , because i just wanted to know , and i wanted to make it even even wanted to do what i learned in the study of theoretical .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to somehow get closer to the matter , like this .
i think the molecular biology in general , so generally , you know , the biology , all of what you do , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , it &apos;s already extremely important and more , much , much more important in the future .
there &apos;s so compelling things like these entire umstrittene plants were changing plants .
it &apos;s now craig venter now , craig venter , trying to make biofuel , so gas from algae .
and then there &apos;s things that are totally in the world , which most people have arrived at all , for example , for example , waschmittelenzyme that allow us to wash 40 degrees laundry , are also gentechnisch enzymes .
and the list can continue .
and so the interest in this technology , in this technology , i &apos;m going on on this .
so , why now hacken ?
most of the people know that most people .
computer hacken , and then it will always be like this , yes , yes , the hacker , somewhere , somewhere and the claws , and so on .
this is sort of really sad for the hackerszene , because it &apos;s not true what they actually started , and what &apos;s actually about it .
and this is the software-hacker , in the 1970s , achtzigerjahren , achtzigerjahren , and it &apos;s also started the internet .
and it &apos;s about using an playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and problem that is not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a zugangsproblem thing , which is to make any sense , a question , and how you can do that differently or how you can do better .
and it &apos;s got up with software , but there &apos;s also a elektronikbereich , there , there &apos;s also a whole bastlerszene that do all kinds of things that make all kinds of things .
and that &apos;s also in biology , in the direction of synthetic biology , is a informationswissenschaft code , because it &apos;s a informationswissenschaft code , which is actually a informationswissenschaft code , because it &apos;s a informationswissenschaft code , which is , it &apos;s not quite the same as computers , because it is dynamic , because it &apos;s matter , so real matter , and not just cyber .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it , and so you can also hacken it , and that &apos;s what i found incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper .
that actually , in fact , eight really accepted , these networks .
there &apos;s a hackteria dot , which is originally from switzerland , which is originally with europe , and with one cooperation india in india , which is now mitglieder , or active people all around the world .
this is a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot more artists and philosophers with scientists with scientists with scientists with scientists with scientists with scientists , with these technologies , and to try and process that are creative , and there are museumsausstellungen and yes .
but actually , it &apos;s always about trying to find access to find that such an playful way to make it so .
and then there &apos;s do-it-yourself-bio dot , d.i.y.bio .
this is a network that is actually a network that &apos;s actually more like this , in fact , where it &apos;s where you &apos;re talking online .
these are a little bit more technical and a little bit more technical , and also a little bit of a little bit of businessmäßiger questions .
and based on these networks that have done all the popular , we have a scene that i &apos;d like to porträtieren .
here &apos;s the picture on the left , you see biocurious , which is a hackerspace , which is basically a kind of school , a private school , a society facility where everyone can be .
children , old , all kinds of people are going to be there , and they have a laboratory in the lab , and look at what they can do when they go .
here on the left is a group , there &apos;s a group in indonesia , which is , you know , but it &apos;s quite a long time .
longer than those other two networks .
they &apos;re also in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , also elektronikbasteleien , and combine it in pretty much more sophisticated ways .
a group that i had met a while i &apos;ve met a while i had met the public more and more what they wanted to teach the public more what they were learning in college , and they &apos;ve tried to explain so little things that &apos;s trying to explain what d.n.a is .
and i have a lecture on the top of the other image in copenhagen at the medical museum in copenhagen with an exhibition with an exhibition .
and that is , yes , that &apos;s the most of the time people are pretty young people , but the only thing that all the united states is , is this fascination of technology .
and what you can do with it , and you have to ask the society for society , so , you know , what you do , what do you want to be interested , have you interest in your interest with this ?
so , o.k , in order to hacken biology , you have some material .
you need , of course , of course , biological materials , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s then a lab .
and what you can normally understand under a lab , which is kind of abgefahrene machines , extremely expensive , extremely distanziert , just for fachpersonal , trained academics and so on .
and our approach was to say , o.k , that you don &apos;t have to do that .
that &apos;s actually not necessary because every one of each kaffeeautomat has developed even more technology than most laborgeräte , which is really like this .
and the brother with this premise with that premise , for example , brian degger tries to be trying to have a minimallabor in england , and it &apos;s a dampfdruckkochtopf , and , yes , so suppenbrühe , and then it &apos;s grown with bacteria .
so anyone who has been a soup once that he has a long time to stand up too long time .
so i tried this home in my lab , and i tried to take a little bit of ebay on ebay on ebay on ebay and a little bit of d.n.a analysis , trying to make a vaterschaftstest , so that &apos;s the way back home .
that &apos;s not supposed to be a joke now , but .
and you see here in the lab , it &apos;s the lab , in anführungsstrichen , in anführungsstrichen , which has a group in paris , which has a group in paris , which is where it has a group in paris , and it &apos;s pretty successful , and also quite interesting things , and i &apos;m going to also do a project .
and this is biocurious , which also mentioned hackerspace , this yes , this one kind of volkshochschule , in principle for molecular biology .
and yes , so you see it &apos;s relatively relatively relatively heterogen , so that &apos;s where there are people who are doing their own home , so much larger organizations , so much larger organizations that hold on the more formal .
but always the way that it &apos;s always going to stop and to be accessible .
the first project that we &apos;ve been doing as an international group , as an international group , as an international group , when we were really aware of our ourselves , and we are online , and we are online , and we know the people who are always chatten and so .
and then from the do-it-yourself-bio webseite website of the founders , and he said , well , we have to make ourselves real , even real meeting , and then there are two events organized in london , one in london , 10 , and shortly in the u.s.a , in san francisco .
and then , in fact , there &apos;s o.k , yes , who are we , what do we want to say , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values and what is our economics , our foundation ?
and then we have a code-of-conduct water .
that was quite intuitive , so everybody has just got this wishes , and what moves it moves , put it , put it .
so , i think of a very good code .
and we then have that , and that &apos;s not verbindlich , but it &apos;s true , i think , it &apos;s got relatively , and people are quite convinced of this .
and we &apos;re actually trying to do that in the academic world , but there &apos;s no way it arrived .
so i think we &apos;re out of the biohackerszene , in terms of course , even further than the academic world .
yeah , what do we actually do now ?
a project i made with the hackteria-netzwerk in switzerland was that we wanted to make a so-called optical trap or optical pinzette .
this is , if you focus a laser in the room , in a room , you can bring small particles in the air , or in that focus , so that &apos;s what you captured there , so like this , like this , like this is a traktorbeamstrahl .
it really works , that &apos;s going to be done in the academic setting , and we &apos;ve thought , well , we have a webcam , we &apos;ve taken a webcam , the aufgeschraubt , the lens , umgedreht the lens , you have a microscope , which is about vierhundertfach .
you see this down there .
and then we have a d.v.d brenner auseinandergeschraubt , and then wir the laser , and then it &apos;s trying to focus on that camera .
and it didn &apos;t work , unfortunately , but we have learned a lot about it yet .
so another project that comes from the french french group from paris , that worked , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and that &apos;s what he did , so it &apos;s so much as a hirnwellenmessgerät or something like this , so he &apos;s engaged with neurobiologie , his nickname is sam sam neurohack .
he then got this kind of helmet that this helmet , and in cooperation with the museum , it &apos;s gone .
and then the visitors were able to go in the space to go in the room , sit on this chair .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought , or how they thought , they &apos;re then different lights in the room .
was a pretty schickes project .
another thing out of the united states , which is also with this vaterschaftstestgeschichte , which is the p.c.r , which is the polymerase-kettenreaktion , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about adding copying genes , vermehren , d.n.a , to reproduce , so you can make them visible .
so if i do that , in the scene of the scene of the scene of the crime , go out there , there are some haarproben , and then they can apply this method , and then they can say , o.k , that hair belongs to this person , like this .
and the machines that make things like this , they &apos;re quite expensive that you buy , the least go to viertausend euro .
and this is not in hobbybereich , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be very much .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
and you know , you know , that two bastler rangesetzt and i said , you know , you know , two bastler rangesetzt , and i said , you know , in the open source of open source , and it &apos;s open source , and then you have this device , and you have the cheapest , and we have to get the cheapest anbieter of these devices around the world .
i think somehow , six dollars or something like that .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s actually in a scale where it is more available .
so i think about a very gelungener hack .
a project i started in the past was to build a gene-gun .
gene-gun is , yes , like this kind of kind of luftdruckpistole , you know , two inches or something .
you put d.n.a on goldpartikel , and then you put it into diese , and then i took them up to zwiebeln , and then put them up so .
so the device that you see is that it doesn &apos;t work .
but this is my prototype prototype , but it &apos;s quite a little bit like this , so on a branch of electronics , the thing on it , and the pressure , and it was connected , but the pressure was too high , the thing was broken .
and then i took a sahnespender and put it together .
a sahnespender , if you have the full of water , the enough pressure , so i think so 40 to sechtzig bar .
and then you can accelerate the particles enough enough , and then you go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about fünfzehntausend euros national or something like something , sahnespender the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically doable .
and this is , at the moment , at the moment , the kernanliegen of technology is to increase the availability of technology and also increase the information , and verständlichkeit that more people can be engaged .
because , as in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have a pretty little bit of that , and also not an opportunity to get there .
because if you read only about it , out of sekundärliteratur , that &apos;s not the same thing as you &apos;ve seen it yourself .
and i think technology is always more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to be able to make good decisions in society , you want to be able to make better decisions in society , you need to know the access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it and understand it and understand it .
and then the firmiert flow under the schlagworten and citizen science science science .
so , you know , you can be able to be able to be able to be able to do with these scientific technologies .
and this is the kernanliegen of the biohackern .
these are the people , at least , at least put on the website , d.i.y.bio-dot-org website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and interesting is also that they &apos;re represented in southeast asia .
that &apos;s what i think is there are fewer people eingetragen than in fact .
so i know about some that didn &apos;t fit .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
partly with these hackerspaces , these places , these places put together .
and that &apos;s in the beginning .
as i said , zweitausendacht it started .
and hackerspaces , so the computerhackerspaces , because the c-base in berlin was the first , neunzehnhundertfünfundneunzig .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , infrastrukturzentren that are represented throughout the world .
and of course , of course , we &apos;re hoping , of course , we &apos;re going to continue to go around , and then very much connected , so there are more people involved in it .
and i would invite everyone to deal with it , and let me deal with .
it &apos;s not that simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity , and enough energy , you &apos;re also going to get there .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hello .
how do we actually work ?
this is a question that i &apos;m very moved to as a designer , but also in the realm of the forschungsbereich , and in front of all things in the field .
it &apos;s about how to see people in interactive media , so they can use these interactive media media and make them a similar experience .
and i think that an interactive media in us , kognitive , cognitive models , so paradigm that in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we can actually create that by interactive media .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that these hochtechnologie that you see that they &apos;re actually going to get in the future , but in fact , the future is that the future , the future is in our archaischen .
now , what are archaische models ?
i &apos;ve been writing by four stichworte , and i &apos;d like to just explain .
it &apos;s the models that we &apos;ve learned in the other times .
to this archaischen models of models , that we have basically a natural relationship to virtuality .
that sounds quite unusual .
and i &apos;m going to go to that , and i &apos;m going to give you an attempt to try to show you that they have a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second thing is that we &apos;ve been able to talk for this archaischen models of models , which is able to be able to talk very , very bildlich , even though we &apos;re using a kodifizierte language .
and the third area that is actually explaining by itself .
we all know that the interactive media is the definition of definition , which involves the denial , and what of course , and what of course , of course , says that we &apos;re going to be normal today .
the fourth point is that history is a place for us .
now , as it is with virtuality that &apos;s actually the most natural thing that is the world .
i want to give you this .
how many doors have the house that you live in ?
we won &apos;t be able to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen right now .
they go through the spirit through this house , in demn they live , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they virtualisieren the reality , and it &apos;s no computers .
fantastic , right ?
and we &apos;re trying to make the virtual reality , for example , for example , the virtual reality , for the virtual reality , we can actually show that all the time .
and this wealth that vermögen the virtual reality that people have been required in the other times , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any fotolitografie .
they didn &apos;t have media media .
the only thing that they had was their head .
and in that head , the memory was .
in this head , abgerufen and through these virtual images , the imagination , became passed on .
and so it &apos;s so powerful in us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
the interesting thing is , if i can make a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s going .
the interesting thing about this is , at this time at the same time , at the same time and medium and medium itself .
now if you think a little bit more .
what are media today ?
you will notice that it has given a change .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to talk about .
the primary tool of the informationsvermittlung have been stories .
schamanen , priests , so-called wissenswächter , were extra abgestellt to keep knowledge in stories .
and today we &apos;re still very , very strong about stories .
the author of the book of the storytelling animal , jonathan gottschall , we &apos;re still verbingen hours of eintausendneunhundert hours with the rezeption of stories .
this means a child for a kid that has spent the most of the time to the most of the großjährigkeit of stories .
now we think our love to stories depends on that we have been a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far out .
that &apos;s a lot further back , in the cultures of the other times .
but for me , in the realm of interactive media , as a particularly impressive , we have stuck in our biological memory , the ability to think .
i &apos;ve brought you an example of the nordamerikanischen tribe of the nordamerikanischen tribe .
and life lived in the küstenregion of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very inselreiches area , and you had to go out there somehow to go from island to island to get food .
and they did that with something called lead-landkarten .
you may know that if you &apos;re interested in a little bit about the australian nations .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have lead-landkarten , but they &apos;ve got the gennanten , or also traumpfade .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be mapped .
where the language was untergeordnet by untergeordnetem .
that means you &apos;re navigierte about sound and rhythm .
and these sound and that rhythm have to have geology , of course , the topography of a region , and it has , of course , of course , that you could do these songs and sit and go to the left , and to the right , and back to the right , and again .
why aren &apos;t we singing to come from a to b to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s happening there ?
this is what &apos;s happened .
we &apos;ve been doing it in the so-called vogt-zeitalter .
this is what happened is the age , and it &apos;s happened , and it &apos;s happened , and it &apos;s happened .
and this is exactly what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories of memories of our individual memories of our individual memories of external media .
on the book and on the picture .
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god to virtualisieren .
virtuality has suddenly suddenly become alien to us , and has to do nothing more .
bruce brown , a famous designforscher on the brighton-university , is so far as far to say that this media , and the image , which is the internet and so on , on the internet and so on what we call as media media today , that these media media were carried our memories of memories , and our ability to virtualisieren .
let &apos;s do a little zwischenbilanz .
from vogt-zeitalter to the age machine .
what has einflüsse on our thinking and our erinnerungsvermögen ?
and then the verblassenden of the opposite cultures cultures .
and they &apos;re going to be more and more überschrieben through centuries of the maschinenzeitalters through the maschinenzeitalters .
that is , instead , instead of remember , we have limited , very common , far , conventional patterns of memories that we can hang our personal memories .
we &apos;re not producing even more .
we have an abstract language .
we don &apos;t ask the thing anymore in images in images , but we kodifizieren them our language .
we have been used to that things happen .
and we &apos;ve been accepted as law , and there are only exceptions , like , for example .
what &apos;s left to us is the storytelling .
we &apos;re still being arrested as a informationsvermittlung , very , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s now ?
we had the vogt -zeitalter , we had the age age , and we &apos;re going to go now to this so-called cyber-zeitalter .
that sounds very spacig and sounds very much like science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of the cyber-zeitalters , they get us to discover our skills back again .
it &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about non-linearität , it &apos;s about storytelling .
i just want to explain a little bit .
there are technical concepts like , for example , like , for example , the augmented reality , which is the extended reality reality .
so if you look at google glasses , for example , if you look at the real world with the real world with the real world with the real world , it &apos;s called our affinität to virtualisierung , which is the virtual as a normal thing , which is going to be seen as a normal thing .
another example is called virtual reality .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to sound like in the context of my talk , of course , sound , is moving us in not existenten , in existenten , virtual worlds , all the way to the role model .
and other example are the ambienten , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
all this is the ability to accept our fundamental ability to accept as a real habitat .
i &apos;m in the degree , and i hope that the video works , a very , very beautiful project , this is the bachelorarbeit of michael burk , ann-kathrin krenz , joris klause and jan-moritz müller .
and the two letzteren are here today .
maybe you can get up for a second , so you can pause in the pause with the two about the project .
and i &apos;ve got this project , as an example , i &apos;ve brought back to these archaischen cognitive models .
the whole thing is a game i have to say .
which of course , of course , is extremely entgegenkommt , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i say computer games , you &apos;re very likely to see that any people in front of some people in front of some konsolen , or that they &apos;re playing with some of the konsole .
anyway , they &apos;re doing that .
this is a game .
and this is the point that i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world again .
and this game is linked to the virtual world , which is the data that we produce with the real world .
i apologize that i have to be so strong .
you can then explain that much better , there &apos;s more than much more behind it .
and this is about that i discover a city by looking at what &apos;s positive or negative getwittert .
and so i get from the city to the city of the city , a whole different impression , and i see negative and positive zones of a city , and i get a whole different , virtual map of a very real city .
and we &apos;re going to look at this now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little bit of what you see in the same .
of course , the virtual world in the walls of our cities of our cities .
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to wrap it up with my talk and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the vogt -zeitalter , and that we &apos;d like to summarize a little bit of verschütt -zeitalters , and that we can be activated , and that we can be activated in this way of complex , about complex , technological technology , new products in fact , not in the future , but we actually come back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be able to be with you .
i &apos;ve been wondering if that bag is a sprechender bag and i &apos;m going to be speaking .
it won &apos;t be done .
i &apos;m also going to resolve what &apos;s in there .
but so far , i &apos;m just going to do it .
yeah , kids are from nature , or should be curious , designers too .
i &apos;m , of course , i think of the subject of the curiosity of curiosity , and how , of course , as curiosity as well as we think , and why we might lose , and why we might lose , and we have to neu , and we have to neu , and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re dealing with its own existence as a gestalter .
when professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to be in such n forschungssemester .
and that &apos;s what i had over the last half a year .
a forschungssemester of natural user user user user interface .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why all the media designers begin with so natural , archaischen urformen of communication , interaction and so on .
and there i &apos;m just one of these little devices , because things are supposed to be more intuitive , and more natural and more natural , and you have to look at what is actually , of course , for us people , of course , of course , what is benutzungsfreundlich or intuitive .
and before the background , i have design in the area of natural interface , which is the next generation of design , so the next generation in the relationship of the human computers , how our tools , or how the computer is changing from the machine to the digital assistant .
so i &apos;ve been doing it , of course , when it is , of course , or intuitive .
maybe another look at it again .
why does that happen at all ?
so , when we look at the development of our society , in short , we &apos;re going to move from the third to the fourth gesellschaftsgeneration , or gesellschaftsform .
so from modern to the computergesellschaft .
every society is shaped by a primärmedium .
at the beginning , the stammesgesellschaft of the language .
and that means that you &apos;ve found a common language , you could communicate with a common language , you could be able to communicate in the same cave , or in other areas , you &apos;ve created cities , or in other areas , and it has to make nen stammesgesellschaft .
it was the language , something very natural , something very living .
now , you also had to learn , so no one can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning about it , of course .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction abstraction .
that was a riesen-aufschrei , of course , because , of course , of course , because you know , of course , the living language was in the form of writing , which is what fluid and alive is , i &apos;m going to start , and i &apos;m going to take it into stone , and i &apos;m going to do it .
depending on how i meißel , and when i meißel , of course , it &apos;s a very different coverage than if there &apos;s a living alive .
but sukzessive then , and then sukzessive the script as a primärmedium .
and then the next generation that we actually came in where we live today .
this is just through pressure and print writing writing with gutenberg and others .
it was as much as a affront , where the adel , klerus , and others have said , you know , if the people start to read , then they want to go , and that &apos;s , of course , of course , fatal .
and now we come to the next generation , and the exciting thing is that a generationswechsel is only a few hundred years , and we &apos;re actually right now in this in this phänomenalen phase that we &apos;re involved in .
and that confused us , of course , because we see on the one side of the new media , socil social media , facebook and so on .
and with complete transparency , which is the new thinking , you don &apos;t say that in the lasagne , you don &apos;t say , you don &apos;t say that in lasagne pferdefleisch , and no more phenomena is more or other phenomena , i just want to do this right now , and you want to do it at all .
and these two worlds are shining together , new and old thinking .
the exciting thing is , if you look at this , this new society , these computergesellschaft , entlehnt , are very many mechanisms , principles and archaischer paradigm from the stammesgesellschaft .
but now not more at the local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the theme of ecology is a global .
not when i think locally , and the neighbor , and the neighbor , it doesn &apos;t work .
that is , from the local village , a global village has become the same principles with the same principles that , of course , but also the total transparency .
and as you knew in the village , who was going to whom and when , this is what &apos;s happening today about this extension of our self through these mobile endgeräte endgeräte on global scale .
that we know that we know global and faster and faster and faster .
just as it was in the village earlier .
in front of the background , i &apos;ve got to look at what does it , which is it really , of course , what we have , of course , what we might have , which is , what we have to do , but instinctively , so what makes the difference ?
because people are often , they can &apos;t do it , they can &apos;t make it .
so you have to look at it , which is , because it &apos;s not just changing it , it &apos;s different , but it should be better .
and when , of course , as a designer , and how can i take a designer on it , and how to make things like this is how they make things a benutzungsfreundlich , so intuitive , they &apos;re very intuitive , and they &apos;re easy to use .
and then you know , you know , during the student , the subject of perception and the wahrnehmungspsychologie .
and that &apos;s , of course , of course , where you start and watch it , and look , okay , now i just look into the inner self .
and what does it actually look like there ?
so how do we work when we reingucken ?
and what &apos;s actually , of course , of course , intuitively and how do our channels our channels and how does the cognitive processing work ?
because steve jobs has said to dig deeper to understand it .
so you have to really look at the details , if i want to make something benutzungsfreundlich or intuitive handhabbar , which is the core of the core .
and you see , you see , you know , you know , you know , we have five , which we have five , you know , there are seven anerkannte , in the near future , you know , in the near the next , at eighth sense , and an extension of our self .
and to look , how do we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is a difference that is a difference .
many of them use the word , don &apos;t even know what detail means .
but i have to understand in the core , in the nature , when it is information to information , when information is information from data , and from information , so i know , so i know how i can make things more intuitive , or of course , can make things .
and of course , what design takes an impact on perception .
we see this when i do things , if i can make things like on the right , where i don &apos;t know what is salt salt and pepper , or i can make you sort of kind of intuitively , by showing things .
so a lot of natural natural , which is in a vessel , but i sort of looking straight , where &apos;s salt salt and pepper .
and when i tell someone , give me salt or pepper , he &apos;ll start thinking about salt on the right now , where it is in .
and then the left is just access to the left , and then i hope that no sugar is in , the salt salt .
but also our perception of ourselves , how makes it täuscht us .
for example , this perception in the context .
the right circle looks bigger than the little , even though that &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s equal to the size , and yet our perception , depending on what context we do .
anybody know what that is ?
come on .
pattern recognition should still work .
it &apos;s going to be more like my glasses .
so it &apos;s n circle .
a second circle is beginning to kind of relate to a kind of similarity or assoziieren .
and if i think of a halboval dazusetze , then we can &apos;t only see a unit , which is circle , circle circle , but we see one unit , we don &apos;t see more three parts , a circle , a circle , another one .
it &apos;s called gestaltgesetz , or eben , which is also influenced us in perception .
for the gestalter , they have the most of the time in the first semester , the great gestaltgesetze .
gestaltgesetz of the continuity of the continuity , and so on .
so often , in the third , even forget .
but this is a essential thing to do if you want to make things like that , too , too intuitive .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , very interesting .
all right , you know , first , you know , is so exciting if you &apos;re getting closer to it .
so we have the eyes , and now we think we &apos;re looking at the back from the front of the front .
that &apos;s wrong .
you look at the back of the back .
actually , you know , you know , that you can see something you can see , beispielweise circle .
that means we first see our view before we see it , again , back to our seheapparat , to say , okay , okay , okay .
i &apos;ve got a cognitive rückkoppelung , you &apos;ve got what you want to see .
that &apos;s then , again , that &apos;s coming back .
it goes back to the front , because the back , because the back of the front and says , you know , look at again , i &apos;m going to look like what you see , if you see what you see , is what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s just seen .
so a whole , really , spannender process , how certain things happen and what these things happen .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s seen this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing i &apos;ve described .
now everyone &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s seeing .
does anybody see something ?
a dalmatiner , right .
if i &apos;ve seen this , that there &apos;s a dalmatiner in there , then you know .
you &apos;ll never forget it anymore because i &apos;ll show you where the dalmatiner is .
now you see the dalmatiner .
and on , you &apos;ll see it always .
that &apos;s what i mean , you know , i &apos;ve got it in the sense that you don &apos;t know anymore , but i &apos;ve got it back in a very short time to see this dog in this verworrenen picture .
and this is this projection of vision , rückkopplung .
now i know , and now i &apos;m going to look at the time that i see the dalmatiner .
i see the dalmatiner .
so , very exciting processes , which then , in this , yes , she &apos;s not actually , but here it is in this rosanen mass .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
this is our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to knowledge as a designer .
if i know , it takes three seconds , until i sort of sort of like the present in the present , and then i can überbrücken bridge very well , in which i &apos;m going to do it by someone with three seconds .
it just has to process as the present .
then it goes into the past , and so i can bridge very elegant wartezeiten , for example , when i know this phenomenon .
what takes fünfundzwanzig milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
a very interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time time in love .
what that means , if you know , if you look at this , you &apos;re looking at who you look at how long , because i don &apos;t leave any gewähr for what it can happen .
and sechzehn milliseconds , also a very interesting phenomenon .
this is the period of most of the perceptions that we have .
this is , this first impression happens in a rapid fast fast speed , how we perceive things .
and as we see things also , what we &apos;re looking at and how we protect ourselves against our environment , so that we can do that way .
of course , the designers , of course , in the subject of perceptions and neural verarbeitungen or kognitionsergonomie , but mainly , of course , of course , with the issue .
so , like a man with certain things .
and there &apos;s a produktsprachlich thing that &apos;s practical functions , which is something like that formale things , and things like this .
there are anzeichen-funktionen , where i know where i have to reach .
but there are also symbolic functions , why is someone like this a little täschchen , where does there hardly be a little bit of money on money , even though it &apos;s not so practical ?
there we are more likely to be on the symbolischen , on the bedeutungsebene that we &apos;re also concerned with as a designer designer .
back to my actual topic of natural interface and the subject , which is , of course , dahinterliegt , is usability .
usability always means how to be able to get a certain goal , or how can it be done in a certain amount of people in a particular situation , effective , efficient and zufriedenstellend .
that &apos;s the norm that says .
how can i do something like this ?
can i do that directly or i need to use the n manual , or i need an ne training .
and less usable or benutzungsfreundlich is it .
that i &apos;m going to do it differently and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and if you &apos;re in part of the software that we just saw , you can also see why neunundneunzig percent of our today is a little bit intuitive , or not auf , in many fields , in many areas or i-phone , even though , even more intuitive than classical software .
and this is an intuitive benutzbarkeit , not only since apple is a fundamental wirtschaftsfaktor , nen fundamental erfolgsfaktor , when i want to make technological devices .
why ?
because in the rule , we &apos;re in this new kind of nutzbarkeit , which is , for example , for example , five times faster on average of our goal .
you have to imagine that if you make some of the classical softrware , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , just one more hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you probably have to go back four hours to go home , but your company or anybody , then you know how to do it with the four hours .
but i want to say that , of course , for us , of course , it , it , of course , of course , to make certain things .
so , if we go to the software , this is so the first command interfaces that were very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
and then the next , the next thing to the next is to say the nem , or mental model like the software , they &apos;ve been working , that you have an idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to make the computer .
so no longer zeros and ones , or kryptische code , but a metaphor .
this already made a lot of benutzungsfreundlicher , but it &apos;s also a lot better .
and the next generation of graphischen benutzungsoberflächen works very much more with behavior .
so i &apos;m designing as a designer , as a designer , very much more often than this .
this is also a paradigm paradigm .
so , at once that i &apos;m always unwichtiger for the success , it &apos;s just an app app .
and if i take a step into this natural user interface , where i agree by a voice by language , by sprache , by gesture , by gesture , and no longer by mouse and cursor things , i &apos;m even faster and more quickly .
so that leads me to the point , at the point , when are things going to be more intuitive ?
if you become more intuitive , and then i &apos;ve got to look at my little friend here , and see what does this mean , what does this mean from the kognitionsergonomie , when there &apos;s really some intuitive ?
and that &apos;s for us people always have something to do if i have to think about it .
so he doesn &apos;t like to think , but they &apos;re just going to be doing it .
the less i sort of thinking about it , the more intuitive is .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
that is , if we look at that we can transfer existing handlungsmodelle from one to something else , for example , the metaphor , i can use this as a gestalter .
that means , i can put an intuitive , human handlungsmodell on software , and make the software a lot of benutzungsfreundlicher .
and of course , of course , the question , of course , what is the most powerful handlungsschema of us people , and now i already have .
this is called osit-modell .
that &apos;s using each of us and osit is an acronym , and it &apos;s an acronym , selektieren , inform , informieren , informieren .
that &apos;s all of you all the time , but he &apos;s doing it unbewusst , and you know , and it &apos;s kind of instinctively .
so the model is in the womb in the womb , and it &apos;s interkulturell , so it works in young and old , and it &apos;s used by us all the time , without that most of the people knew that this model is present .
osit osit is going to be about 50 to siebzigtausend times from us , in the sleep , so in the sleep , you &apos;ve found that it &apos;s a lot less often than a day .
so , i can now transfer this mental handlungsmodell , selektieren , informed , transagieren , übertragen .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the desktops , but it &apos;s not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a handlungsmusters , a handlungsprinzips .
and this is on a higher grail of benutzungsfreundlichkeit than the transmission of classical metaphor , which is the desktops .
and , for instance , for example , for example , when i can look at this point , for example , for example , i can look at the point , for example , i can look at the details , and yes , i can look at the details , and yes , i can see that somewhere , or you can send somebody shop .
then i can transfer this whole .
i &apos;m trying to do this through a beispiels .
yes , everybody ate pies .
übersicht : now i interact with the object , again , again , reinzoomen .
i &apos;m going to get the entire overview of this , and i can say , just just show me all about chocolate with chocolate .
and once you have an interface , which is a lot more intuitive and very much more natural .
because i can reach things like the bits , and they can come to me , is far more natural than when about hierarchisch , or other mechanisms , or other kinds of mechanisms can make these things accessible to these things .
so , with that sentence , more important than , and with this sentence , i &apos;d like to conclude a little bit , too , too designers need to think differently to new solutions , and in this sense , i thank you very much for your attention and please .
i want to bring you to a particular aspect of curiosity .
the first one , when you get a child , as a baby , as a baby , is that you have to take care of what you have to do , more or less in the töpfchen , the more or less , the more , and the more , you know , your curiosity , of course , your curiosity .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
that &apos;s about all that are , in fact , are people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i think about it now , basically , all of these umweltdiskussion , weltuntergang , 40 years umzusetzen , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point .
and it depends on phosphorus .
give pee a chance .
every day you have an scale , you give two percent phosphorus , and two grams , and you have two gram of phosphorus .
you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
they can &apos;t have bone .
we can only be as amorphe mollusken through the weltmeere .
if we don &apos;t take out phosphorus and run out .
it &apos;s amazing that we &apos;re dealing with something , which is actually ne , but it &apos;s not that way .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody talks about the phosphor-problem .
the phosphor-problem is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have phosphorus for two years of phosphorus , and already , through the phosphor-bergbau world , in the world , much more uranium in the environment than in all atomanlagen .
in the last 20 years alone , fünfzehntausend tons of uranium have been spread in our fields in germany .
and we take it all up .
it makes leukemia with children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little bit less harmful .
so for example , for example , the environment , drive less car .
the environment , make less waste .
the environment , the environment , less energy .
that &apos;s no protection protection .
this is how if i would say , you know , schütz your child , it just blow three times rather than five .
this is just a little bit less destruction .
if we think about it from the wiege to the bahre , our entire earth is going to , or later a friedhof .
that &apos;s why denken to think about wiege .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as first .
in the ground , over 60 percent of the kohlenstoffs is stored .
at the moment , we actually build corn the corn and we lose between 11 and 30 kilograms of 30 tons per hectare , or in the square meter .
that means we lose the ground for about five times more than new .
well , of course , we can look at the müllproblem .
and everything is packaging or content .
for example , in offenbach zwanzig , 20 percent , 20 percent of the world &apos;s hausmüll .
and because we get older , it will be bigger .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re all in the vorwindelphase .
yes ?
a baby needs about six windeln .
we could , of course , to 10 percent , but what does that ?
it &apos;s ausgeglichen in china in a second .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go to these windeln ?
one of the evidence here is that men are not pigs .
let me tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be abgegeben in the festen .
the people about the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what you see , right ?
traditionally , we think , in umweltdiskussion , we are too many in the world .
and if you get the people that , if you say it abspricht , if you say that , it would be better , you &apos;re not there , you &apos;re going to be raffgierig and hostile .
and so somebody like al gore says , one of our big heroes , one of our big heroes , there &apos;s nothing more wichtigeres than the human population .
in israel you know , in israel , you know , you , you know , you have the earth .
this is what you &apos;re saying , the more you umbringst , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then ants weigh about four times more than we humans .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , none of termites like that , you know , even though they &apos;re vegetarier .
that means the ants weigh a lot more than us .
and because they &apos;re going to work much harder than we have , and because they live only three to six months , they are in their weight , in the energy consumption , slightly 30 billion people .
that is , we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you &apos;re going to get away from that , what we really wanted to do , what we really wanted to do , and what we could do , and what we can do is , is that we can see , for example , for example , for example , have a program that have a program , for example , for example .
you can only be klimaneutral if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you seen a klimaneutralen tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that is , our whole intelligence means that we wake up as trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is kohlenstoffneutral .
fortunately , not , yes ?
there &apos;s no überbevölkerungsproblem on trees .
there are still six billion trees alone in the amazonasgebiet .
did you hear something about überbevölkerungsproblemen from trees ?
that means all our intelligence means that we &apos;re dümmer as trees .
and where you see , even in something like demeter , the most strikteste bio- agriculture , it doesn &apos;t allow us to go back .
every year we &apos;re losing this three million tons of tons of phosphorus that really had to go back into these .
and we &apos;re too many .
just about it .
that &apos;s what we feel so guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no bio-landbau , no bioland , no nature-et-progrès , and as they all say , they allow our own exkremente .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to make sense of being less harmful , which is ölverbrauch .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about minimize a big footprint , which is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , is the highest , not there , right ?
nullemissionen , yes ?
you can only nullemissionen if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shot now , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can back our nutrients back .
we do agriculture in brazil in which we back the nutrients .
in fact , in this way , we can &apos;t have nutrients in agriculture .
we do this in china , for example , where we just take the waste of it .
in china , it &apos;s called a nachttopf today , so you know , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , our nutrients .
that means that the whole western zivilisationsgeschichte draws by the city of the city , but the farmers has never returned .
so the cities had to grow more , because the farmers were going to cities and the cities always had to move away their nutrients .
so all of this is because of all the western rich , all of this is expanding until they haven &apos;t done the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re implodiert .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve been able to get bruchlos civilization over five years , because you &apos;ve been able to do nutrients .
even today , if you invited to the food , you would expect to eat the food that they &apos;re supposed to be as long as they see the toilet .
because it &apos;s unfreundlich to go and take nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to the food , not to nährstoffdiebstahl .
that means you can see on the internet as you can back back the nutrients .
that &apos;s what &apos;s beautiful when you do that , if you do it is , in a acres , in a hectare acres of country with five people in favelas , it can make a farmer about eintausendfünfhundert dollars , and the plant is going to grow and enten and enten and vegetables and fish .
and the great thing about this is the verbrechensrate in the favelas by about neunzig percent .
so , we don &apos;t have to control people to be bad .
we can support them to be good .
this is , of course , of course , high-tech-landwirtschaft , but the plants themselves carry themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re so designed by the design that a farmer can just manage them .
that means that the verbrechensraten go back .
and none of these assets , we &apos;ve been built over hundertfünzig in the last 20 years , none of these facilities have ever been sabotiert .
and you could just einfach a liter of altöl reinwerfen , and then the plant would be ruined over years .
not instead .
that means we don &apos;t have to control the people to be bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to zurückkriegen phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what &apos;s going to do it , in germany , you know , in germany , in germany , in germany of all the treatment , it &apos;s in frankfurt .
unfortunately , that &apos;s not in offenbach , but maybe you can do a little bit of the frankfurtern .
because the frankfurter facility could be the best out of the phosphorus .
and it has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s done .
we &apos;ve been using it over three years now .
the dutch government has explained , they &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , which phosphor phosphorus .
but we need that .
understand , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the phosphorvorkommen world .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of waisenknaben .
these are sechsundzwanzig countries controlling 40 percent of the ölvorräte .
and the oil is going to replace the oil .
but you can &apos;t replace the phosphorus .
that &apos;s not about making the existing slightly less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and in fact , first of all , what the right thing is .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
in holland , you understand that , of course , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if , for example , your wife is sad , if you , you , you know , and you &apos;re coming up with fifty .
very inefficient .
but all right , yes ?
or take a lippenstift .
a woman in germany eats about six percent percent of their life .
there .
that &apos;s not scientifically right , because we don &apos;t know how much weggeküsst is going to be done .
but a lippenstift , even with that lighting , can i tell you , is completely inefficient , but all effective , yes ?
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not efficiency efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
not to burn a little bit better , and abzulagern it to lose all the materials that are losing all the materials , but first to ask , how do you connect ?
now , imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i go to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with offenbach-geschmack and a glass of water .
wonderful , right ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love in love ?
yes ?
this is what matters in life is not about saving , to avoid it .
all the umweltdiskussion .
we tell people , oh yeah , you don &apos;t get green in the south .
no , it &apos;s just the right thing , yes ?
in every place , where you wegwirft , you know , you &apos;re going to get lebensmöglichkeiten .
but the wrong thing .
if you wegwirft the wrong things , you have a müllproblem .
as we think of north .
there is every footprint there .
if you walk , yes , every footprint is destroyed the ground .
because the ground is going to die off , and the wind and the water is washing the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water is going to be in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that is going to be a feuchtgebiet .
not schuldmanagement .
we say in germany germany .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how do you have this with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , herzliches beileid , yes ?
so that &apos;s just the size .
so , not saving , avoid , avoid .
every waste is nährstoff .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you see in italy , the people in the high bow of the car , the coladose out of the car .
because you know , this is a lustvoller process .
it &apos;s an alternative form of revierverhalten , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
, for example , for example , for example , for example , , for example , it &apos;s the room .
they can wegschmeißen where they go and stand .
in two hours , it turns out everywhere .
and it contains seeds from rare plants , so that they make it throw away from biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there are two cycles .
not everything to be kompostierbar .
a television washing machine or a washing machine , they just use that they don &apos;t use .
just the things that are verschleißen , like schuhsolen , like autoreifen , like autoreifen , like autoreifen , they have to be in biological systems .
the things that are only going to be used in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
so that direct advertising , not for the company puma , but for that , you &apos;re now helping this company to make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t make things more free .
yes ?
so , when i go to the food and say it &apos;s free , it &apos;s free , you can &apos;t help you .
no , we &apos;re stuck what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like detox .
not toxic inside .
it &apos;s all , it &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes that you can go to the kavalierstart of the fußgängerampel and the gummi can go into biological cycles , yes ?
all of them is kompostierbar .
and when it comes to us , of course , we &apos;re going to do for nike , for nike , for hennes and mauritz and the textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the abwasserprobleme worldwide that are caused by the textile industry .
so that &apos;s why you &apos;re helping , ask for people .
hey , puma , power is you really seriously ?
because they &apos;ve already changed the vorstandsvorsitzenden .
and i &apos;m not sure that they really dabeibleiben .
so , help me a little bit .
but it goes .
yeah .
that &apos;s what has been shown .
that &apos;s going .
we can do things like this now , if you kaputtgehen , if you kaputtgehen , you can do it in biological cycles .
there is the same technical system .
there &apos;s this direct rücknamesystem .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , that &apos;s made to go back into the cycle .
this is also , in any store , you can see things .
so if you come , yes ?
do you remember the windel ?
when there is the trash .
all over these windeln around , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
it &apos;s on the deponien , but even in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastics , so that he can go in biological systems , if we can change the wasserspeicher , inside , you can go back to zellulosebasis , then you can do with a baby in israel or tunisia in tunisia , trees .
yes ?
just if you take these windel , you sterilisieren , sterilisieren , sterilisieren and the powder to get trees .
this is the baby kohlenstoffpositiv for the whole life , from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be klimaneutral , we can be klimapositiv .
it &apos;s kind of a beneficial poop print .
yes , you know .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything else .
i started an institute .
there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can get involved .
there is extra a society to cradle-to-cradle-verein , cradle-to-cradle-verein , where everyone can join .
so no longer save , up , avoid , avoid , reduce , not schuldmanagement , but smart waste .
does this curious ?
thank you .
the work of interpreten .
music as a language .
in the description of my talk to my talk , i wrote as a übersetzerin , as a übersetzerin , in the english wortsinn .
interpreten are english of the written music in klingende music .
that , as a translator , as a translator , is not just using word for word to another language , but also the deeper sense of the words of the words and wortzusammenhang , so that it has a good translation translation , anybody who has to do with fremdsprachen .
translating out of the germans in english , can require more knowledge , rather than if you &apos;re about poetry or anything about poetry .
but it &apos;s very alien to laien , which we do with our musiksprache musicians .
so , as a musikstückes , i first got the written notes .
you think , you know , you know , you know , in the course , you know , in the notes that you have dreamed of what it has dreamed of .
in fact , the notes are very vague and ungenau .
these notes are about just the same or ungenau , like a verbal verbal , and also very seemingly , beschreibung , description of a landscape .
because in this verbalen landschaftsbeschreibung , the smell of flowers is not going to smell , the level of the grüns only to the erahnen of the windes , not to feel .
that is , the role of the notensprache , in a different one , which is hörbare , hörbare , concrete nonverbale translate .
today , i want to tell you what else i &apos;m going to say , well , interpretiere , in a verbal a verbal language .
so basically , a translation of translation .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to you do all the way to do it in german , because if i had to put it into english , it would be equivalent to me in translation to the translation of the translation .
so , the music works for me as much as the spoken language .
the notierten notes have the function of a script .
so it won &apos;t take just notes to read , and you &apos;re going to be able to read the keys on the piano or the right place on the piano .
that &apos;s just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of the letters you can only see if you can do the language .
so , you need to take the process of music learning at least least as long as the spoken language .
so there &apos;s also abstufungen , if you learn it for the hausgebrauch , or you can be able to be active , or you can also speak to the musical speaker .
the work of the interpreten starts like a theaterregisseurs .
once you first chose to play a piece , because you &apos;re excited about it , you take a forscht of the origin of composition of the composition .
you collect information about the piece in the sekundärliteratur .
you read in the letters , tagebüchern , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of composers itself .
we studied the work that he was doing before and after .
you think about it .
the beweggründe , writing it .
how did he feel ?
how were its circumstances , like the society and politics ?
this is all interested in me .
you &apos;re thinking in that time , you think of contemporary images , looking at a literature .
but in the time , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a rich knowledge of times that you often play , and it gets easier to be easier to get into it and feel it .
the composer is going to be more and more of the friend that you live together .
his concern to write the play is going to be more and more to my personal cause to play .
now , there &apos;s all the notes as a genaue record of the message of this composers is , but just a framework , i &apos;m going to turn this framework and meaning for it and meaning .
i then say to my own words that could be written between this framework .
i &apos;ll play what these sounds could mean .
now for me and for composers , for me , and what she could now mean for him today .
every note , every phrase gets a sense , because i feel it myself because it comes out of my personal gelebten .
it needs to be stimmig for me here and now , otherwise i can &apos;t convince my audience that this is my cause .
it &apos;s over again a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been trying to do it as long as a new thing .
as you &apos;ve seen a happy day , even though you &apos;ve seen with the same rituals of life , up , stand up , up , you get up to work , and i &apos;m going to do the same piece over again .
i &apos;ve become a day older , the seasons change , my pulse , i &apos;m going down to the morning , in a konzertsaal , it takes for sound to return to coming back at home .
i &apos;m going to take the audience , consciously , or unconsciously .
all that influenced me and all that affects my experience with the composition .
so , quite wonderful , if i &apos;m standing on the stage on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , angeregten conversation .
you get a new idea in it , and it &apos;s going to answer that answers with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we don &apos;t have , and what you can &apos;t have .
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and as the audience has experienced how the music communicates alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i will never play more like this moment .
i can &apos;t play that games in 20 years today .
now , i &apos;m going to have more lebenserfahrung than today , and i &apos;m going to have a lot of the musikklänge , and so much more farbnuancen , in emotions and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some farbtöpfe also , but there &apos;s new dazubekommen .
have a nice example of that .
it was on a klavierkursus for musikstudenten in my beloved old teacher , professor jürgen ude , a well-known beethoven-spezialist , konzertpianist and long-term professor of musikhochschule here in stuttgart .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so it &apos;s been emeritiert when i finally started studying .
but i was lucky enough to meet it very early , very early , 13 years , and i &apos;ve been able to meet in his classes .
i was 17 when i went back to one of his courses , and played the last of the four of the four balladen of chopin , a spätwerk .
he asked me what the introduction of this ballade was for me .
that &apos;s a getragenes part .
and in my jugendlichkeit , i said , expectation .
he said , he said , like this ?
this must be the altersunterschied .
because for me , it means memory .
he was already sechzig .
well , with 17 , you have dreams , but there are no major memories .
i &apos;ll play the play every few years , and it &apos;s changed for me every few years , and it changed for me , even though not a single grade has changed .
every time , it &apos;s exciting , because again , i read something new .
an example of this is a very different area , monet has painted the seerosen x-mal .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different tageszeit , with verschiedenem light .
he &apos;s translated the seerosen verschiedentlich , as he saw it , as you see , in this moment .
his personal impressionen of seerosen .
the x-malige interpretation of a piece is comparable .
now , i &apos;ve also been older than chopin with zweiunddreißig , when he wrote the piece .
he lived only neununddreißig years .
and it &apos;s important to me , again , again into the notes , even if i mean you auswendig it .
to keep zwiesprache , directly with composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially when he has died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said , you know , you know , you need for about the spoken language .
so often the musikunterricht is that you learn to read the notes .
you &apos;re learning first first , before you just talk a word .
it &apos;s learning to find the sound on the notes on the instrument .
if all the fingers in time and the right , as it is in the notes , they come out , they get sounds that they sound like music .
if that happens , the students get the nächstschwierige play .
it &apos;s barely talked about interpretation .
well , there &apos;s a presto thing on the front , that &apos;s a fast piece .
lento , slowly .
loud and leisezeichen , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s what most of you know .
but even when you translate that data , it &apos;s still something more technical .
and it &apos;s always not interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that people often forget something quite elementares .
which is that to make music on the instrument , and feel your musical musical , you should be there before .
that is singing .
a child who didn &apos;t sing it , because it didn &apos;t have the parents , they don &apos;t do .
this is like sprechenlernen .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music , and then it &apos;s about another way of getting an instrument to sound .
people who never explained , so never felt immediately with their own body , as it is to make a sound .
designing a phrase with his breath .
the music instrument is the extension of our body .
our vocal path to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
this is the hammerköpfe the sequel the sequel the sequel of my finger .
the melody comes out of the gesungenen and the rhythm of the dance .
the dauernde berieselung today is not förderlich .
you don &apos;t need to make more music if it gets boring .
no more necessary to whistle or sing .
every single music is going to be plattgemacht if you &apos;re constantly beschallt from the outside of music .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
the question i can &apos;t sing , you can &apos;t sing , a , because you believe you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t have learned to sing ?
in two , it &apos;s not too late to begin to figure out if you can &apos;t do it or learn how to do these little muscles that einstellen the vocal whale , right .
that &apos;s what you can train .
or c , because you have bescheinigt them , they &apos;re untauglich .
and i ask , how fachlich competent was this diagnosis ?
have you got a zweit- or drittmeinung , how do you say it &apos;s beautiful today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and you don &apos;t want to do it .
and then what i &apos;d like to do , because music is a beautiful , kommunikative thing .
but maybe you can also umstimmen them .
well , you can see , all of the cases , no one needs to be a aussichtsloser candidate .
but don &apos;t tell me , i don &apos;t understand anything about classical music .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
i &apos;m saying , but you can tell you if you don &apos;t like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it &apos;s telling someone , i don &apos;t know if it tastes me because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t eat the food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to give up on classical music because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to and tell if it tastes or not .
whether the music is to gepfeffert or sweet .
tell what you feel .
the time you get the time , and you want to have some more gewürze , or taste even fine differences .
now , why am i challenge my audience to be active ?
because the music is a language , and a language to communicate .
a piece of work you never look at , has no force .
the food that was made by a chef or a chef liebevoll , has to be eaten , and recipes or recipes .
so you &apos;re listening to if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice geräuschtapete .
if in an area where the adults are doing action , or at least active music , a child aufwächst , then it &apos;s quite easy to ask , to ask , what color is your flower ?
can you now play it in blue ?
and the child plays , after a gedenkpause , rather than a rote , a red flower .
and this sounds very different than before .
and then this was the first first beginning to begin musical expression .
so the first step to an interpretation .
and what happens if you &apos;re going to play a bit today , which originally has been written a hundred , before , or even three years ago ?
now , the instruments have fortentwickelt .
there was the stream at the time as an instrument still no piano piano .
it was not invented yet .
i think the stream would have been excited if he had the klanglichen possibilities of modern klaviere .
i can now have the klangvorstellungen that the stream has had the stream , on the modern wing , in the modern wing , which can &apos;t be a barockes cembalo .
also by beethoven beethoven , you know that he heard more when he was deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that has been rejected in the orchestra .
so the reason that composers depend on us depends on interpreten the pieces of the pieces .
so you &apos;ll get up to what you &apos;ve just dreamed of in the mind .
and also , what you &apos;d think in the mind today .
or what i &apos;m talking about today , because what they might have thought .
thank you .
do you know what is envy ?
were you neidisch ?
and how did that feel ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
and when i come to my little v , with my little v , and i get this feeling .
i shoots a little schießt .
i &apos;m saying , ulf , what do you need to do ?
that &apos;s actually losing half his value in the first year .
and at all , you work much less than i .
why do i have to afford so &apos; n car ?
and then i immediately think that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward feeling away .
our organism has invented a great way to get such subtle feelings like envy .
you can also try it with words like revenge or gewinnsucht or something .
i want to explain to you with this mechanism today , or näherbringen what you &apos;re doing .
the mechanism comes from lie .
but if you don &apos;t think about the lie , as you may have heard , when people say , no one has a wall to build a wall .
and then rocks auftürmt , so he versperrt them .
on one such lie , you see that the liars themselves don &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to check away that it &apos;s very different in mind .
he &apos;s just täuscht it and not himself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about , it has to do with the fact that they &apos;re fake themselves .
they need this lie to get a lebenslüge to get a selbsttäuschung .
they can get less easy , yes , nachprüfen or auch .
they need time .
from that time is an anecdote that you might know .
the spanish painter picasso once has a woman portraitiert picasso .
this woman was beschwert , the portrait wouldn &apos;t see her at all .
picasso says , just wait .
it &apos;s always going to be similar .
and when you laugh , you see how important that lie is , and how much time you need to learn something that artists can share very well .
because artists have a gestörtes ratio to lie .
the artist is sharing you something , and especially this lady , which she doesn &apos;t see when you look just in the mirror .
the artist shares them in a portrait such portrait a portrait that you &apos;re familiar with when you look at this piece of art .
and then this awkward feeling disappears , it could not look at all , and it &apos;s always going to be more like .
here they have this mechanism mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention of our lebensverhältnisse .
and not only in art , also in the volksmärchen , in the volksmärchen , in stories , comes back up .
you might know this idea of the lady that looked at every morning in the mirror and asked him , who is the most beautiful in all the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a schönere .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and they also know how much hostility from that true tells the mirror the mirror can &apos;t lie from that true tells us .
but we should just be familiar with that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a schönere somewhere else .
here it requires what we need to understand under politically correctness , over again .
we need that a lie in this point that a lie that täuschung us , without living .
we don &apos;t only have in art , in the volksmärchendichtung , but also in science such a great lie .
and there is this story of the woman &apos;s frau .
she heard about this book from charles darwin , the origin of species and the abstammung of people .
that the person should abstammen and , yes , at least , at least a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her up to her husband and said it &apos;s probably not true , what charles writes .
the person should have abstammen or a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not going .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to prevent people to know .
why do we prevent people to know about something when it &apos;s true ?
because without these lebenslüge , we can &apos;t live .
because we &apos;re doing this selbsttäuschung , that feeling , that feeling great to be great , of the highest nature , not from such an organism , from such an organism that exists , that exists is comparable to a stone , and the things that it is for us .
so , we can &apos;t bear these things .
we need to prevent that people know about things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism look away and how the traces look like the traces that he &apos;s leaving , which lead to something else than in this great image of ourselves , i want to show you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
my wife told me .
she came from a school day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told a student .
a autistischer student .
she likes to love it , because he likes to have a tendency .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and there he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire .
and because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnische things .
yes , you feel it if you &apos;re heiter at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife always , when a human being in a moral point , because of a person in a moral mind , we should try to replace it by the time .
do it once , and then you learn the sentence .
even though i &apos;m at the fire , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnische things .
you feel , that &apos;s the real truth behind it .
this is a little bub that doesn &apos;t care about feuerlöschen .
they &apos;re interested in feuermachen .
but there &apos;s no clubs where we can learn where to learn how to learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second best , just the fire fire .
he signed up .
and überdies , you don &apos;t tell the teacher that you &apos;d like to put on fire somewhere , and you &apos;re happy when the fire hochlodert after .
no , it looks a lot better if we show that we are in charge of the risks that others do when they just put fire fire .
here they have this little mechanism .
and these verweis , the bub already knew that he was actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say that .
here you have this zensor between the unconscious and the conscious person who immediately can do something about it , and the things you know , you &apos;re very different , so designed that you can sound much better for you and others .
and then just like that , just like these words that we &apos;re using in the language , in the language .
we actually know that something else is .
but we know when we tell that , the social story is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to present things like a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
so i want to tell you what we found in my institute .
after what logic is that deception , these selbsttäuschung , the willingness , a different reality than the ones that we actually know in the unconscious is that they &apos;re guilty to spread outside .
i want to tell you two , maybe three examples .
so the first example of what many of you know , and some of you , and some of them don &apos;t need at all .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is something intellectual , says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something which is not stofflicher stofflicher , physical nature .
and if you have people who have a soul that you have to have a soul , or you can also say that they have a soul of your soul , and you &apos;re also able to say that the way that the soul is such an intellectual frame , you can &apos;t only from meat and blood , and you know , something like , in the earth , you know , vergängliches , vergängliches , verwesbares , ja .
and from this soul , you think it somehow in this wolkigen nature , in this luftigen nature , in this means , in latin america , the lufthauch .
and if that lufthauch lufthauch over the people , he &apos;s filled with dignity , with the spirit , with nature that can only live , yes with soul .
and then he can just davonlaufen .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s going to come from the outside to people .
so we &apos;re supposed to be able to see them as something , which is supposed to be present for our lives .
and if you have that premise , you understand the logic that we &apos;re going to experience this happiness , through a lie lüge our world .
because now you can apply a dreisatz .
they &apos;re still familiar with school .
now , this is a dreisatz that describes us a logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
that is to lie that you can just apply that logic logic .
in this dreisatz , three sentences .
the first sentence is , klaus said , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if klaus is right , he didn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i hervorgehoben it in particular .
the third sentence , which comes straight into people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say who don &apos;t have a soul , who &apos;s dead and can &apos;t say anything .
and here you have it .
here &apos;s this logic in this , yes , in this täuschenden talk .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logical correct .
because i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t talk about reality .
i can say the kanzlerin is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the kanzlerin is a man .
if i didn &apos;t get right , the kanzlerin is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so when klaus says , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he didn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical correct .
and now our täuschendes consciousness feels immediately , you can do something .
it &apos;s a third sentence that doesn &apos;t have anything to do with the first two sentences , and it &apos;s like the opposite of the first sentence already proved and vorausgesetzt .
because actually we have to prove if there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that just uses that two sentences are correct , and a third dazuhängt , which looks like this , he would have to do something so that we can save our lebenslüge .
so , we do that , as if it would be impossible without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things in different examples .
in the present , we &apos;ve got a very modern example , which keeps füllt the tageszeitungen .
this is another philosophisches topic that you have to hold your mind .
this has to do that we go back to the vierzehnte century .
there was a gelehrten who was johannes , and after that was called buridansche esel .
the buridansche esel is a esel , of pure nature .
it &apos;s not that soul .
this is such a naturding .
and if you put the exact in the middle of two gleichgroßen heuhafen , it verhungert .
because he doesn &apos;t know where he &apos;s going to go first .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
this is the naturdinge .
gleichgroße forces with gegensätzlichem vorzeigenzeichen will solve each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening there .
only if you get another example , so if you immediately do a haystack bigger , then it doesn &apos;t need any reason and nothing about it .
automatically he goes to the right thought .
so if you have this idea that it &apos;s sort of driven in nature , it &apos;s going to be driven by the larger pile that immediately , you know , you also have the feeling that it has to give a free will .
and if we &apos;re already here in frankfurt , then i remember brain in brain science .
there &apos;s a gelehrten who &apos;s called the wolf singer , and by him , sometimes , the wolf singer said , there &apos;s no willensfreiheit .
now we can form the second sentence again , and we can say , if wolf is right , he has no willensfreiheit .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can now read for almost every day in the daily newspaper that you can find in this third sentence .
it looks like this , who doesn &apos;t have willensfreiheit , can &apos;t be moved for his actions and claims of responsibility , and it &apos;s so unzurechnungsfähig .
again , you &apos;ve got it again .
in fact , you know , you have to prove that there &apos;s something like willensfreiheit .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this as if the first set of the first sentence is wrong , of course , if you have to take the opposite of it .
and now you can just , if you want to do something yourself , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , that courage to hold to lie .
practice , for instance , for example , if you see a human being able to say , there &apos;s no vorhersager .
and please don &apos;t use german word for vorhersager , which is the prophet .
you can &apos;t call it , that &apos;s a little bit more politically inkorrekt .
say there &apos;s no vorhersager .
immediately you will have one , for granted , you know , you know , for granted , you know , you can &apos;t prove .
and you have a problem .
because while they &apos;re busy doing it , you know , you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no vorhersager , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he fooled her .
because he led them to a fährte that he doesn &apos;t aufhält themselves .
because actually , this man is not interested in evidence .
he &apos;s only interested in interested in the need to have evidence of the need to prove that there &apos;s vorhersager .
so , in the kind of shift in the art , you &apos;re going to experience of the lie .
and once you have an opportunity to feel this dreisatz in other people , they do it , because they &apos;re going to make others happy if they don &apos;t remember that way .
thank you for your attention .
yes , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve been able to tell you if i can mention it .
she &apos;s one of the veranstalterinnen here from this great event , and he asked me if i wanted to take a talk here and introduce my idea .
i &apos;ve got to say , frankly , you &apos;ve got it mitgekriegt , initially , at the beginning of my idea .
and may i think i might be able to imagine that i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
but of course , of course , the sum , very many ideas .
i &apos;m likely to be , you know , is the two nice girls , i &apos;m likely to be one of the generation that i &apos;ve been doing for this bad image , because i &apos;ve been starting to study maschinenbau in karlsruhe , technical school , and today , you know , i believe .
and then , in the middle of the achtziger years to berlin berlin , because i wanted to make renewables , and that was not in karlsruhe .
there was the kernforschungsanlage leopoldshafen .
they were all the time , the jülich was called kfa .
they are projektträger today .
because a good engineer has either made great cars or atomkraftanlagen .
but something like &apos; n solarpendel , which comes out of some hundred hundred watts of the square meters , that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy ingenieurkollektiv .
i &apos;m grateful that he has a word the word again , because after the mauerfall , you couldn &apos;t use the word anymore because everything left left was bad .
however , it wasn &apos;t that in the achtiziger years .
it was like that there was selbstverwaltete alternativbetriebe , and one was sitting in kreuzberg in kreuzberg , where you thought evil .
it was called wuseltronik , but it was wuseltronik and wind and solar power , and i started in the mitte .
and yes , a lot of what i &apos;ve been saying , very much , because many , a lot of beautiful expressions i have lived through .
i &apos;ve been working for 11 years , which was basisdemokratisch .
we were twenty people .
if one was told , the vetoprinzip , which has been a completely zermürbt , i &apos;ve been hard for 10 years , if i was going to do my great ingenieurstudium , if i could do my great ingenieurstudium , because all of all the colleagues of my father were always zugeredet , you &apos;ve got the money on the window in your child .
it &apos;s beschäftigt .
and that was really very , very bitter , and it &apos;s in the same stage , and it &apos;s a picture , which is a picture in a picture , where i asked for 10 years , and a thousand d-mark were still at the time , grundlohn , einheitslohn , of course , whether that &apos;s supposed to be the great thing .
and i then got it up to sechsundneunzig ausgehalten , and then with friends with friends , i &apos;ve become mitbegründer of the company that then started with the spin-off q-cells of the world &apos;s largest zellenhersteller .
so , again , we have a little bit of the problem of a growing company , but also , we have a little bit of the problem , which is , of course , the problem , of course , and we , of course , and what we think about , of course , it &apos;s a little bit of crazy , which starts again , that people say , what &apos;s going to be the rubbish , it &apos;s not going to be talking about .
and i brought you a project that i &apos;m going to imagine now .
and the title of the talk was , you know , how you get to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started to ask a relatively einfach-verrückten history , where could you have a memory for a memory .
on this island , this is the island of graciosa on the azoren .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there are four thousand people .
they have a renewables today from 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
it &apos;s just not technological .
when they zubauen more windkraft , the system starts failing .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to tell the politicians in berlin-adlershof our facility .
they always say , why ?
we &apos;ve already got twenty percent in germany already .
but can &apos;t be a problem at all .
but not , we &apos;ve got seven percent in europe , and our net is physically seen the european .
if we were in europe 20 percent , then we have the same problems that people have on this island .
and the question was simple , the first of zweitausend2006 , the first contacts of the island , but it &apos;s just going to expect .
because in fact , as big as a battery , you know , you know , you have an island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe 70 percent renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go back again .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , a hundred hundred gigawatt electrical performance in the world will zugebaut .
this is the equivalent of a hundred nuclear power , because it &apos;s very quickly everywhere .
the energiehunger of the world , that is going to be deleted with diesel because you don &apos;t need permission .
that goes fast .
you put it up there .
and then it looks at the rule .
they always run three of the dieseln , two will always wait .
yeah , this is what it looks like down there &apos;s the load .
we also get very accurate data .
and the windkraftanlage or the solaranlage , or whatever it is , in the rule , in the rule , in the rule is a system , which is a system that can only be einspeisen in small quantities .
our goal was just to say , okay , okay .
it &apos;s going to be back-up and the wind , sun uses the burden that they can map the larger amount .
and if you &apos;re about 20 , 30 , 30 percent renewables , it &apos;s energy per year , not the performance at the moment , then you have to turn off the diesel .
that is , in the moment , you have to worry that renewables can make the entire net .
you can only , of course , if you have managed in some kind of being managed .
it didn &apos;t have any one on the world .
this is in the little style , so you can use your rasierer on your car over a little wechselrichter .
people always ask me , what do you really do in adlershof ?
it &apos;s already happening .
but if you want to zusammenschalten , and you want to build a net , it will be extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to come up to 70 percent renewable percent , and then there &apos;s another one , the last 10 , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which is going to be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work that you do that for batteries .
it &apos;s going to be a energieträger , which then , hydrogen , methane , power , power to gas , you know or sch , it will be then .
you then have to go to a saisonalspeicher and winter-sommer and not only ausgleichen .
we just wanted to know what to be with a normal stinknormalen battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then have a whole lot of simulation .
and the wind and the sun and the sun , and the sun and came up to the result , a very interesting result that you &apos;re going to take a middle of the conventional system that after 20 years , you need a middle strompreis of about 50 cents a kilowattstunde , about 50 cents a kilowattstunde , about 50 cents a kilowattstunde .
that was the first calculation six years ago .
and then we said , okay , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the diesel-system , if it &apos;s five percent a year .
and then we started to negotiate with the insulanern .
what had to be done ?
i &apos;ve been looking for investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new gesellschafter .
we were only five people at the time to build the society .
and here &apos;s the representation .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system also has a preisanstieg , because it &apos;s that we &apos;re still 20 percent , and it &apos;s not durchschlagen on the other things .
and the power-utility , which is the elektrizitätsversorgungsunternehmen on the island , is what we find great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin in berlin where we can actually actually map of the island of scale one to three very accurate .
that means we were looking for the first thing to find the largest battery of the world .
here it is .
it actually comes from asia , in the case of japan .
and witzigerweise , in the &apos; 70s , in the early &apos; 70s , in the &apos; &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , and became auslizensiert on the japanese .
it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
it has a megawatts of achievement and it can take six hours for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery we kind of sort of simulationstechnisch rausbekommen .
and then have set them set .
we also have one of these diesel-aggregate in the same size , as he is there , in the hall , in the same way that it is , in the hall , in the middle of the komplette , in the back , in the back , there &apos;s the big battery , here &apos;s the big battery , and there &apos;s all the umrichter that we simulate the web .
this is what we &apos;re doing over here &apos;s the whole übertragungsleitungsystem , the kilometer-physik of the cable , to make the schwingungsverhalten on the net .
and here you can see this whole .
we can also aufschalten kilowatt kilowatt on the net .
this is what we see again again , again , again , again , again , the whole , individual aggregate .
and what we did was , since zweitausendneun was the hall , and then the way that we &apos;ve been doing this , as much as we have to develop here between the individual system of electronics to design , we did .
so we &apos;re not batteriehersteller , but we define ourselves as a company that &apos;s just between the subject and the subject of the web and everything in between .
you have to communicate , of course , to the battery , you have to be able to communicate the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is about the topic that you &apos;re basically in this island today , and all of the things that we &apos;re going to get when we want to increase our share of renewables .
so this whole discussion , which is going to be going back in the moment and herbewegt , which is to go , on the island , for example , for example , for 30 percent exzessenergie , so we müdsen the wind and the sun .
natürlicht is then smart-grid .
so smart-grid , a riesenthema everywhere .
we can start to integrate with the island , and we can try to integrate elektromobilität , rumzufragen , because we manage the burden .
that is , if you &apos;re 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do it without memory .
you can move through &apos; n smart-grid , you can do it by ausbau , you know , you should do that you should do , but you &apos;re never going to get rid of memory .
and that &apos;s the n little bit of the message .
so many people come and look at a lot of people and look at this point , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn off the diesel , you know , we don &apos;t have that spinning mass that causes some kind of inertia on the net .
and our europäisches verbundnetz is essentially , only from rotating masses masses of large kraftwerken , where the wave is like all around europe .
we look inside this grid , see the 50 hertz hertz hertz , and when it &apos;s neunundvierzig komma , we &apos;ll start a couple of ventilchen , and then again a little bit of merh steam , then come back up .
this is the system .
and of course , this is incredible .
if you get that somewhere , it takes a while .
the spinning reserves has at least 10 seconds to keep the web stable .
and in the time you can react to others .
if you don &apos;t have that , you have this spinning , you have to replace it with leistungselektronik and elektrochemie .
and we can rein-rausschalten with this big battery two milliseconds .
and then you can see , you know , there are enormous geschwindigkeitsmöglichkeiten .
and the message is , we &apos;ve got to get rid of this rotating mass , if we sort of like our goals 20 , twenty 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 , 30 , 30 percent and so on .
then we have to break down our must-run capacity in the net .
must-run heißt is simply called the power station to keep the frequency .
yeah , this is a riesendebatte at the moment , zubau from the kohlekraftwerken , because we don &apos;t have any , or gasturbinen , because it isn &apos;t .
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that you can make the capacity , the must-run capacity , can break down by bringing elektrochemische memory .
now , there &apos;s also a lot of studies now .
and at that point , people always come and look at our versuchsstand and look at our versuchsstand .
and yeah , the discussion is always about the question of how far can you have a little bit of future .
and a lot of discussions that i had in the last six years , were similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years .
you don &apos;t , you know , schwachsinn , kinderspielkram , kinderspielkram , we &apos;ve done everything , don &apos;t count .
we have 30 gigawatt in germany today .
this is vorbildlich .
and i just go out of that , in the next 30 years , we &apos;re going to store the same capacity of elektrochemischen food throughout the world .
very simple , it will come .
there &apos;s going to be a whole bunch of widerständen and arguments .
the nice thing is that i &apos;ve seen in the last two years now that the scientists are asking on my side .
we &apos;ve now got over 10 million förderprojekte , and also , in order to klemmen , for german .
that &apos;s going to be in the next april .
so , from that there &apos;s a change that &apos;s going on there , and it &apos;s only from that abwehrhaltung , to the idea , to the idea , a hundred percent renewables is true yes .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a autarkes system .
so far in arguments , they &apos;re always trying to do , these insulaner , these insulaner , they have a little bit of their own little net , which has nothing to do with our verbund .
the question is very simple , if you &apos;re completely independent from some fossil or uranen energierträgern that will be rausgebohrt somewhere in the world , and you &apos;re actually an island .
and then you only use what to the sun and wind there , where you live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a vernüftigen energy , and i &apos;m also grateful that they said , solar power .
and this is what we do , and it &apos;s going to come to the talk of premium kola , that you may be able to use a collective and use solar power here .
and yeah , i want to just encourage you , in the sense that you can be quiet a little bit crazy and you can also have a vision .
and you really have to be quite zäh , but i think it &apos;s going .
thank you .
when steve lopez , i think about the los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , rau , rough , homeless , homeless on a violin , which only two strings had two strings strings .
so many of you will know the story , because of steves paper &apos;s paper later , the story was going to be a book , with robert downey junior , as nathaniel and jamie and jamie foxx as nathaniel kontrabassisten , the kontrabassisten that studied in the juilliard-konservatorium , and his promising career very early , was finished schizophrenia .
nathaniel left juilliard , suffered a nervenzusammenbruch and 30 years later , he lived on the streets of skid row in the center of los angeles .
i recommend telling you to read steves book , or looking at the movie , so it &apos;s not just the wonderful connectedness between these two men , but also , how the music made this connection , and how they ended up with the instrument , if that it &apos;s allowed to get the mithalf away from the street .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney concert hall .
he just heard a show by beethoven beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony and came behind the stage to me .
he was talking to a very heiteren and geselligen &apos;s sound , and hillary clinton and hillary clinton , and how the dodgers would never make it into the baseball world , and it all because of the tückischen passage of the first violin passage in the last sentence of beethoven fourth symphony .
we came to the subject of music , and a few days later , i got an email , which said that nathaniel was interested in geigenunterricht with me .
i have to say that nathaniel had a medical medical treatment , because he already had been treated with elektroschocks and handschellen , a trauma that has his entire life .
so , as a result , it &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenen stages , and they are sometimes so bad , and they days , in the streets of skid row row , always ausgesetzt that horror horror and the folterqualen of his own mind .
and in the same part of a reizstadium was nathaniel , when we started to do with our first class concert concert hall , and he had this irre flackern in his eyes and worked completely .
he talked about invisible dämonen and smoke and about how someone was poison in her sleep .
i was afraid , not meinetwegen , but i was afraid that he could sink into one of his states , and that i could ihm his relationship to the violin , if i began to talk about scale and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didaktischen geigenpädagogik .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven violinkonzert .
and while i was , i noticed that in nathaniels eyes , it was a total change .
it was as if he was under the impact of a invisible drug , a chemical reaction , which was my game .
nathaniels manischer anger turned into understanding , in a quiet curiosity and grace .
and as a miracle he took his violin , and began to be heard some clips of violinkonzerten and asked me , and asked me to end it : mendelssohn , tschaikowski , sibelius .
and we began to talk about music , from bach beethoven beethoven beethoven , brahms , bruckner and all the other bs , from bartók to esa-pekka salonen .
and i realized that he was not just a enzyklopädisches knowledge of music , but it was also a close personal relationship .
he was talking about it with a passion and one understanding that i &apos;m just going to know about my colleagues in the philharmonie of los angeles .
by playing music , and he talked about music was this paranoiden , confused man who had moved through the streets of los angeles , a liebenswerter , gebildeter , excellent , in juilliard .
music is medicine . music is changing .
for nathaniel , music is emotional health .
because the music allows him to think of his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something real umzuformen .
and so he entflieht his quälenden states .
i understood that exactly this is the nature of art .
this is the reason why we make music that we do something that is in all of us , deep inside of us , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of that expression is all of us , and moves us all , inspired and united states .
what nathaniel are doing , so it brought the music back into a community of friends .
the erlösende power of music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood his talent and achtete him .
and i &apos;m going to always with nathaniel music , whether in the walt disney concert hall or skid row , because he reminds me why i become a musician .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i put on unverschämterweise cellisten .
i hope she &apos;s forgive me .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first , which was more like a passionate passionate .
it was a beautiful fish , wohlschmeckend , good konsistenz , gehaltvoll , a new bestseller .
what a fish .
even better , he was grown in aquakultur after the angeblich highest standards of sustainability .
so you could think of being able to sell it .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
and one day , the head of the company called and asked , if i could give you an event , about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem has become for our chefs , how do we keep fish on our speisekarten ?
in the last 50 years , we have gefischt the oceans as we have forests .
it &apos;s hard to überbewerten the destruction .
so 90 percent of the great fish that we love , the tuna , the heilbutte , the lachse , the lachse , they have collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so it &apos;s probably going to be nice , or übel , fischanbau , part of our future .
so a lot of arguments . fischzuchtanlagen the environment , and fischzuchtanlagen the environment , most of you , and you &apos;re inefficient , let &apos;s take tuna tuna . a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a futterverwertung from 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds needed to get a pound .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t tastes very well .
so here &apos;s finally a company who was trying to do it right .
i wanted to supported them .
on the day before the event , i called the head of öffentlichkeitsarbeit for the company .
let &apos;s call it the don .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to grow so far out in the sea that you don &apos;t verschmutzt the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste of our fish will be distributed , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this futterverwertung of 2.5 to one , he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what do you feed ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
and at that night i was in bed and thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , i called the next day before the event , don .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to know .
well , i telefonierte with a few people in the company , and no one could give me a proper answer , until finally , at the biologists .
we also call it don &apos;t .
&quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some fischmehle , and then he said , hühnchen-pellets .
i said , &quot; hühnchen-pellets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , knochenmehl , reste , reste , reste and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your futters is chicken ? &quot;
perhaps two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what is sustainable about feeding chicken ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i entliebte myself from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a selbstgerechter genießer and gutmensch .
that &apos;s me .
no , i actually entliebt from this fish because , i swear to god who geschmeckt fish after this conversation after this conversation .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love .
it &apos;s the romantic way of the way that you know , the way you know your fish , you know the more the fish .
i had eaten him first in a restaurant in südspanien .
a befreundete reporter has talked for a long time from this fish .
it &apos;s sort of verkuppelt us .
he came along the table with a light , almost schimmernden white color .
the chef had ihn him .
hold twice .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
who can make a fish taste so well after he got verkocht ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , he &apos;s called miguel .
and no , he &apos;s not cooked the fish , and it &apos;s not a chef . at least the way that you and i understand underneath .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
this is a fischaufzucht in the südwestlichen corner in spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s was the farm in the hands of argentiniern .
they raised fleischrinder on what they were basically the wetlands .
they did this by entwässerten the country .
they built this complicated consequence of channels , and they drängten water out of the land and out in the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that work , not economically .
and green was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds , which are many birds .
and this is a spanish company that is bought by the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of the water versa .
they literally umgelegt the lever .
instead of the water , they used the channels to hereinzuziehen the water again .
they fluteten the channels .
they created a little acres of fischaufzucht -- barsch , meeräsche , shrimp , aal -- and they have miguel and his company completely komplett the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
they stare out on the horizon that &apos;s a million miles away , and everything you see are geflutete channels and this density , green march .
i was not at a long time with miguel .
it &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part &quot; a crocodile to the kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were and fighting through the wetlands and kämpften , and i schwitze , and schwitze up to my knees , and miguel , hält .
this is what he made up a rare gleitaar .
now he mentioned the mineralbedürfnisse of synchrony .
and here , here he sees a pattern of bündeln that reminds him about the tansanische giraffe .
it turns out that miguel has spent the biggest part of his career in the mikumi national park in africa .
i asked him how to be a fisch-experten .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i am an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and stürzt to more gerede from rare birds and strange wasserpflanzen .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , which was really fascinating , you know , the biotische community .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak about this verkochte piece of köstlichen fish that i had on the vorabend .
so i was interrupted . i said , &quot; miguel , how does it taste your fish so good ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do you eat ?
how is the futterverwertung ? &quot;
now , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish would eat what they would eat in the wild .
the pflanzliche biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely selbsterneuernd .
there &apos;s no food .
on a farm of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
and then i went around on this site , and i said , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems like that , &quot; different than any farm that i &apos;ve ever been on , &quot; how are you measuring success ? &quot;
at the moment , it was like a movie director wanted a bühnenwechsel .
and we bogen around the corner , and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinker , a literally pinker carpet .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your bäuche , pink .
they schlemmen . &quot;
schlemmen ? i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; miguel , don &apos;t you schlemmen your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fischeiern to the birds .
now , last year , 600,000 birds were over 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s now the biggest and one of the most important private vogelreservate in europe .
and i said , &quot; miguel , is a good gedeihender vogelbestand not the last thing you want to have on a fischaufzucht ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building extensiv , not intense .
this is a ökologisches network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the pinker is the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink that . a farm that doesn &apos;t feeds their animals and a farm that is measuring their success on their own health .
a fischaufzucht , but also a vogelreservat .
oh , and by the way , this flamingos of the beginning should not be there .
they breed in a city of 240 miles , where the bodenbeschaffenheit is better for the nestbau .
every morning they fly 240 miles to farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles .
they do that because they can follow the gestrichelten white line of landstraße .
seriously .
i had a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , &quot; miguel , fly out 240 miles away from the farm , and then fly away from the night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me as if i just quoted a song a song .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fischhaut . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this beißende , verkohlte taste .
i &apos;m almost never cooking .
and yet , when i tried them in the restaurant in this restaurant , they didn &apos;t tasted at all .
she liked sweet and just as if you would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this miguel , and he nickte .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last abwehr before something in the body .
she has evolved in evolution to unreinheiten unreinheiten . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no unreinheiten . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your fish , a farm that &apos;s your success , your success .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have any unreinheiten , it &apos;s enormous , because the water that comes in through this farm comes in from the river guadalquivir .
it &apos;s a river that &apos;s going to lead all the things that are rivers in these days , they tend to lead them , chemical pollutants , flow from schädlingsbekämpfungsmitteln .
and if it fought through the system , and that leaves the water , it &apos;s the water as it is hereingekommen .
the system is so healthy , it reinigt the water .
so not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their success , not just a farm that is measuring their success of their health , but a farm that &apos;s literally a wasser-aufbereitungsanlage , and not just for those fish , but for you and me .
because when the water herausfließt , it versinkt in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and you should do it , because this love of love , as romantic as romantic , is aufschlussreich .
you might say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about barsch or fleischrindern .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one when food actually taste taste taste taste .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
we &apos;re not realisten ; we &apos;re lover . we &apos;re lover .
we love wochenmärkte . we love little familienbetriebe . we &apos;re talking about local food . we eat organic .
and if you claim that those are the things that the future of good food is somebody somewhere and says , &quot; hey , people , i love pinke flamingos , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we produce enough calories to feed the world more than only food .
a billion people are hungry today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the krasser in the distribution , not the gesamtproduktion .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because she &apos;s the logic of our nahrungssystems the last 50 years .
füttere corn , schädlingsbekämpfungsmittel , schädlingsbekämpfungsmittel on the earth , chicken on the ground , and all the time has asked to say , &quot; if we feed more people more than that , how awful can that be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was rechtfertigung . it was the business plan business plan .
we should call them , what she is , an industry in abwicklung , an industry that quickly ökologisches ökologisches capital , which is exactly what enables these production .
this is not agriculture , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our kornkammer is threatened today , not because of abnehmender zufuhr , but because of abnehmender resources .
not through the latest mähdrescher- and traktor-erfindungen , it &apos;s not using pumps , but by frisches water , not by kettensägen , but by kettensägen , and not by fischerboote and nets , but by fish in the ocean .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agrarindustrie-modell for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are obenan in there , and it never made something really good to eat .
now , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is this , in two billion years of arbeitserfahrung zurückgreift .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
what &apos;s not worlds that are the worlds that are in the worlds that are , rather than aufzubrauchen , businesses , the extensiv are growing rather , farmers who are not only erzeuger , but experts for relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones who are also experts for flavor .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;ll ever be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
so if i want to show you one thing today is that the part of the data that we consume , is that the sum of the data that we consume , is that you want to think about how we can use information is that we can use information and we can see patterns that have otherwise not become visible .
so , what we see here is a typical sterbediagramm of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pivot and what i can do with pivot is that i can filter after a particular cause , say accidents .
and immediately , i see another pattern that makes .
and that &apos;s because in the mittelbereich , people are mostly active , and they are over here .
we can take a step out and see all the data and see the data , and you see that kreislauferkrankungen and cancer and cancer are the usual suspects , but not anyone .
so if we sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of age , we &apos;re going to tell 40 years , or younger , we see that accidents are even the main cause of people to worry about people .
and who &apos;s seeing weiterforscht is true to men .
so you realize that this is a look at the information and data in this way of swimming in a living informationsgrafik .
and if we can make that for raw data , why not make content for content ?
so what we have here is the titelbilder of every single sport illustrated , &quot; they &apos;ve ever printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can try to test it after my talk .
they can dive into a decade in a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain issue .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this issue and the sportarten .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i click on this , and i &apos;ll let me show you all the spending in the lance armstrong .
now , if i &apos;d like to get a gröberen overview , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the subject ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to take a step back .
now i see greg lemond .
and so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , gezielter , wider , reinzoomen , rauszoomen , then you don &apos;t just search or not just surft .
you make something that is actually a little different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way that information can be used .
so i want to do this idea a little further with something a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we took every single wikipediaseite and reduce it to reduce it to a little summary .
the summary is a short picture , and a symbol of the area that it comes from .
i just show the top 500 of the most popular wikipediaseiten .
but even in that eingeschränkten view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately we get a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia .
i &apos;m now going to choose government .
well , after i chose government , i know that the wikipediakategorien , which is most of the time magazines , &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important , because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single wikipediaseite .
that &apos;s just to see when you go back and look at the whole thing .
if you look at a certain of these summaries , i can then take time in the time of the year of the year , and you can see all together .
now , if i look at these people , i know that the majority of these are regierungsbeamte . some come from science . some , less , come from the economy , here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the musikbereich .
and interestingly , bono also is a ted prize camp winner .
so we can jump and look at all the ted prize .
you can see , we &apos;re surfing on the web as if it &apos;s also a web , not just to page , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little bit of a little surprise .
i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times .
pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with it -- and we bring these zoom-technologie to every single website like this .
so , i can go back to go back to a specific sektion .
so this is important because you can only look at looking at the web websites in this way , and you can look at the same way .
so i can zoom in my course in my course .
this is the state of the demonstration that i was holding here .
and i can sort of sort of look at what i &apos;ve been doing today , again .
and , if i look back and look at everything , i can neu my course , maybe i &apos;ve been looking for &apos; nepotistisch , and i looked for &quot; nepotistisch , &quot; and here for live labs .
and from here , i can go into the side and go back to you again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used to use again , and every time it makes it bigger than the sum of the datenteile .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a fluch .
we &apos;re talking about the fluch fluch .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head so that instead of going to go from one to another , let &apos;s start to do a lot of things , and see patterns that were otherwise hidden hidden hidden ?
if we can do that , then you will have this past datenfalle , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving in information , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we know , then maybe we can actually pull out of it .
so i hear , thank you very much .
i grew up with a gehörigen portion of science fiction .
in my school school , i went to school every day every day an hour every day .
and my nose was always stuck in a book , a science-fiction-buch , which is my thoughts in other worlds , in other worlds , and in a erzählerische way , my tief , unersättliche .
it also , this curiosity turned out to me , if i wasn &apos;t in school , if i was not at school , walked out of the forests and snakes and snakes and snakes and teichwasser , everything brought home and looked under the microscope .
i was totally wissenschaftsbegeistert , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and to explore the boundaries .
and my love to science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment , because then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon the moon and exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating shows that showed us animals and places and a world of miracles that we never could have imagined before .
so that &apos;s what i think was very good at the science-fiction-rolle .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since there &apos;s no video games , there &apos;s no video games that there were the whole imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we all had to do that . if we read as children as children , we took the description of the autors , and they projizierten them on the screen in our heads .
my response to this was drawing and paint of aliens , alien worlds , robots , raumschiffen and all this stuff .
i was constantly caught by the teacher , like i hid in the hinterm textbook , hidden .
the creativity had to be somehow out .
and something interesting happened . what fascinated me on jacques cousteaus shows was the idea of a completely unknown world here on our earth itself .
i &apos;m never going to do an alien world with a spaceship . that seemed quite unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i could actually walk into , on the earth , and she was just as fascinating and exotic like all of what i had imagined when i read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 to become diver .
the only problem is that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the next ocean .
i did not let me frustrated .
i nervte my father until he finally had a tauchschule in buffalo , new york , found , right on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my tauchschein in a pool of ymca in buffalo in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got to face two years later when we moved to california .
since , in the 40 years since , in the 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 10,000 hours under water . 500 hours of it in tauchbooten .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flacheren oceans , is so rich in faszinierendem lives , how we can really barely imagine .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know boundaries , unlike our own , kläglichen human imagination .
for today &apos;s days , i feel profound awe for what i see on my tauchgängen .
and my love to the ocean is holding with the same intensity as ever and ever .
when i was a profession when i was an adult as an adult .
it seemed to be the best way to tell my heart , to tell stories with my need to create images .
as a child , i drew comic books all the time and so .
so , films , the way to bring images and stories . that fit .
of course , the stories that i &apos;m looking at from the science-fiction-bereich , from the science-fiction-bereich , &quot; aliens &quot; aliens , &quot; aliens . &quot;
&quot; abyss , &quot; i was able to make my preference for the unterwasserwelt and tauchen .
so in the way my two passions passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; abyss , &quot; to solve a erzählerisches problem in this movie -- and that &apos;s where we had to create some sort of liquid wasserwesen -- we griffen on animation , cg , cg .
what came out of this was the first computergenerierte soft-surface-figur ever in a movie .
it didn &apos;t have a money , just said , he just played his costs , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was wie by the magic that came out of it .
as arthur clarke &apos;s law &apos;s law , you know , you know , you know , technology &apos;s law is not different from each other .
so you saw something magic .
and i found incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that must be involved in the filmkunst . &quot;
so we went in &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , a lot further .
and together with ilm , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success on the way that it would happen .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same . but we have a little bit of money with the film .
from these two experiences , it was a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for filmschaffende .
and so i started a company , with my good friend winston , who was the best make-up- and creature-designer , and she was called &quot; digital domain . &quot;
so the idea of this company was that the stage of analog processes was to skip with visual printers , etc .
and we did that , and then we did a advantage for a time .
but in the middle of the 1990s , we realized that we were in the creature- and character-design -- what we actually started with the company -- too langsam .
i wrote this piece &quot; avatar , &quot; which is written in the sachen effects of visual effects of visual effects and computergenerierter effects in all new heights , rather than realistischen characters , expressive characters that had been made by cg , and the hauptfiguren should be all the cg , and the world should be cg .
but the stick out quite well . and people in my company told me that we haven &apos;t been able to be able to be able to do that .
so , i shifted that and made this other movie over the big ship the big ship .
and i &apos;ve got this as &quot; and juliet and juliet and juliet on a ship , &quot; it became a liebesfilm scale , a passionate movie .
but i actually wanted to go to the real train of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
but i believe it by saying , &quot; we go to the up to the train . we movies the real train .
we &apos;re going to show it in the eröffnungssequenz of the film .
that &apos;s immensely important . it &apos;s a good aufhänger for marketing . &quot;
and i überredete them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but again , again , that the imagination can make a reality .
we actually created six months later a reality where i was in a russian in a russian tauchboot , four miles below the surface of the north atlantic , and i looked at the real titanic through a bullauge .
it wasn &apos;t a movie , no hd , that was real .
so , that really umgehauen me .
and the amount of preparation was enormous . we had to build cameras and the lights and everything .
and i noticed how very much of these tiefseetauchgänge , a weltraummission .
well , they were also hochtechnisch and bedurften .
you go up into the capsule , then you go into this dark , feindselige environment , where no hope is to rescue if you can &apos;t get it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a science-fiction-film .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , about the part of curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that could not give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine being able to make a visual visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the fensters .
so some of the next expeditions expeditions , i saw creatures in thermalquellen , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had ever seen before , and for the science , when we saw it , had no words yet .
so that &apos;s got me right , and i wanted more .
and that &apos;s how i met an unusual decision .
after the titanic , i said to myself , &quot; okay , i want to put my hauptberuf a filmmaker in hollywood in hollywood on ice , and i &apos;m going to vollzeit-forscher . &quot;
and then we started , we came to the bismarck , and they were exploring with roboterfahrzeugen .
we went back to the train of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which we built .
our intention was , hineinzutauchen and the inside of the ship , which has never been done before .
nobody had ever explored the inside of the wracks . you &apos;ve got no resources . so we developed the technology .
well , i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a tauchboot , and i see planken that i have here quite similar , and i know that once the band has played there .
and i fly up with a little roboterfahrzeug durch .
it &apos;s actually just , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was in the presence of the titanic of the titanic .
this was the surrealste form of a déjà-vu that i &apos;ve ever experienced . because before i take a ecke , i always knew what was going on in the lichtkegel of the vehicle , because i went to months of filmset when we made the film .
which was the set of the set of the baupläne of the ship .
so this was a highly strange experience .
and she was aware of this telepräsenz-erlebnis thing that you &apos;re using roboterhafte avatare , and your own consciousness to the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
it was really incredibly profound .
and perhaps a little view of what could happen in a few decades , if you have cyborg-körper to explore something or to do things , in all kinds of post-humanen zukunftszenarios that i can think of as a science-fiction-fan .
and after these expeditions , we began to see what we &apos;ve seen down there , for example , for example , this tiefseequellen , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . they &apos;re sort of aliens , but here on earth .
they live with chemosynthese .
they don &apos;t exist in a sonnenlicht system , as we do that .
and this is what you see on the animals right next to a 500 degrees c c they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also really interested in weltraumwissenschaft , which was wieder from my childhood childhood .
and so , i ended up with the people who are interested in space , and in the nasa-sachverständigenrat , and they go to russia , and they go to russia , they go to russia , through the mission of the biomedizinische of all the time , and then they fly to the international weltraumstation , and take our 3d-kamerasysteme .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it turns out that i took weltraumwissenschaftler with us in the deep sea .
and i took them up to the world , there : astrobiologen the world , astrobiologen , planetenwissenschaftler , planetenwissenschaftler , people who were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the vents , so you can take samples and test instruments and so on .
so , we were doing it , but actually , in fact , on science , but actually , weltraumwissenschaft , in fact , weltraumwissenschaft .
so the circle of the circle , as a child , as a child , as a child , and the practice in reality .
in the course of this journey , i learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science , but i certainly think , you know , a director has to be able to be a leader like a schiffskapitän or something .
i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i antrat these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what comes out of this ? &quot;
these blöden movies don &apos;t make us money .
we &apos;re just playing the cost of the cost of fame .
everybody thinks i was between titanic , and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have the nails on a towel on a towel on the beach .
i &apos;ve all got these films , like , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re going to make it about the task of the challenge , the challenge of the challenge -- and the ocean is , you know , you &apos;re doing it because of the kind of weird connection that comes up when a small group of people form a team .
because we did all this with 10 to 12 people who worked for years , sometimes we were two to three months in a row .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing that you have to do is that the most important thing you can do , because you have a task to overcome , because you have a problem that you can &apos;t tell anybody else .
and if you go back to the land , the fiberglas , the schallschwächung , and it &apos;s like , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglas , the whole technology , and the whole way you &apos;re working on the lake , &quot; you can &apos;t explain the other , and that &apos;s like police or soldiers who have gone through together and know that you can never explain it .
there &apos;s a connection that comes with respect .
so when i came back to turn my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you respected your team and respect your respect .
it was really changed the dynamic .
and so i stood back with a small team on unbekanntem terrain , and we were &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
very exciting .
an awful challenge .
and we became a richtigen family for a half and a half years .
it changed my way of making films completely .
there were people who said , we would have this ozeanwesen really well and pandora on the planet .
for me , it was more like a prinzipielle way of doing my job , the real process that has changed in the outcome .
so what can we conclude from all this ?
what lessons do we learn ?
i think the first thing is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the warning of your teams is more important than any lorbeer of this world .
to me , young filmmaker who say , &quot; give me a advice of how i can do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t give you one .
it &apos;s another one for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t bet itself . but take take risks you . &quot;
nasa has such a lieblingssatz : &quot; failure is no alternative . &quot;
but in art and in art , failure have to be an alternative , because it gives you a vertrauensvorschuss .
no important endeavor , the innovation verlangte , ever looked at risk .
you have to be ready to take these risks .
that &apos;s the idea that i &apos;d like to give you on the way . failure is an alternative , fear is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and that may be surprising , because my vollzeitbeschäftigung in the foundation is mainly for vaccines and seed , the things that we invent and deliver to deliver about the poorest 2 billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than anyone else on the planet .
klimaverschlechterung means that their saaten are not going to grow over a lot of years . we &apos;re going to rain too much or too little rain , and things will change how it can &apos;t sustain fragile environment .
that leads to hungersterben . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , the climate change is terrible for you .
it &apos;s also very important for them .
in fact , if you could only reduce the price of one thing , it would be energy from far the most effective .
well , the energiepreis is like the time .
in fact , the fortschrittsgesellschaft is based on energiefortschritten .
the kohlerevolution was the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the elektrizitätspreis , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , klimaanlagen , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s get the price half -- we meet a new barrier , and this barrier depends on co2 .
co2 increases the planet and the equation of co2 is actually quite clear .
they summieren the ausgestoßene co2 , which leads to the temperaturerhöhung , and this temperaturerhöhung has some very negative consequences . effects on the weather and maybe worse , the indirekte consequence that the natural ecosystems are not able to adapt such rapid changes , and so the whole systems .
now , the exact context between a co2-anstieg and resultierende temperaturveränderung and where the other consequences are , there are some options , but not very much .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
i asked the top-wissenschaftler several times , &quot; do we really have to get down to zero ?
isn &apos;t half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will move further .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a 3.5 truck of high truck that has to take under three truck bridge , and then you can put it down underneath .
this is a whole way down to zero .
well , we run a lot of kohlenstoffdioxid every year over 26 billion tons .
every americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of each on the planet .
and somehow we have to change changes that reduce it down to zero .
it &apos;s a constant .
only different economic changes have changed at all , and we have to go from rapidem increase , and we need to go from rapidem to zero to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit , a little bit . you have this thing on the left , which is a little bit of co2 , and it &apos;s going to be dependent on the number of people &apos;s number of people who have every human being on average , the average energy for every service and co2 that is going to be emittiert .
so let &apos;s take a look at each one , and we think about how we get it to zero .
it probably has to get one of these numbers close to zero .
now that &apos;s basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
we first have the population .
today , 6,8 billion people .
and it goes to nine billion zu. to move on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the gesundheitsvorsorgung and reproduktionsmedizin , we could probably reduce 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope to 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this is all , the food we eat , clothing , television , heat .
these are very good things and armutsverringerung , which means to almost everyone on the planet on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could probably do abstriche and less use , but average , on average , that number is going to increase every year , and so much more than double , the number of services that we have per person .
so here we can see a very basic service , so there &apos;s light at home so that you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have , so they go and read their schulaufgaben under the straßenlicht .
now , on efficiency , the e , the energy per service , it &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that &apos;s not rising .
because of different successes in the lichtsektor , through other autotypen , through new ways of häuserbau , there &apos;s a lot of services , there are many services that some of the energy that some of the energy that make some individual services by 90 percent .
in other service of service , like the power of düngemitteln 00 : 56,000 : 56,000 -- &amp; gt : 05 , &amp; : 58,000 or the luftverkehr or luftverkehr , or luftverkehr , is a lot of smaller smaller .
overall , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get a reduction by a factor of three or maybe even about a factor .
but at the first three factors , we &apos;re now now from 26 billion tons of maybe allerbestes 13 billion tons , and it &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that is going to be emittiert .
it &apos;s the question , if you can get it to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every herstellungsmethode for electricity today &apos;s electricity nowadays , except renewables , except renewables and nuklearenergie .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energiewunder .
now , if i use the word &quot; wonder &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
normally , there is no deadline that you need a miracle to a particular date .
normally you &apos;re going to go wrong , and some people are not .
in this case , we have to give vollgas , and a miracle in very short days .
well , i wondered , how do i get this out ?
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that made the notion of people here ?
i remember that last year when i got , and somehow the people like that .
the idea was really tangible for you , you know , that there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , i fell here .
i decided that this was from fireflies of fireflies my diesjähriger contribution to the environment .
so here are some natural fireflies .
i told you that you don &apos;t bite bite . you don &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of spielereilösungen like these , but they don &apos;t all get much .
we need solutions either , either one or several that have a unimaginable and unimaginable and unimaginable , and even though there are many directions that people are looking for afterwards , i really see only five that can afford these great demands .
i &apos;ve left the tides , geothermal , fusion and biofuels left .
they might be able to do a moderaten piece , and if they do better than i expect , it would be great , but my punch line here is we need to work on all those five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they &apos;re einschüchtern , because they all have significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at fossil fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there may be simple , but it &apos;s not . you had to have all the co2 that comes out of the burning of the schornstein , capture under pressure , and then store somewhere and hope to stay there .
there are some pilotprojekte who create a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get in 100 percent of the co2 , which is a big challenge of co2 , is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the lagerzeitfrage .
who will make sure ?
who can guarantee something that literally many billion times greater than any kind of waste you can imagine from nuklear- and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a harte .
next : nuklearenergie .
it also has three big problems . the costs , especially in hochregulierten countries are high . the question for security , that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human community , is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that may be solvable , and that &apos;s why you should work .
the last three of the five of the five .
it &apos;s renewables as they &apos;re often called .
and they also -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need any fuel -- they have some nachteile .
one is the energy density that these technologies are dramatically smaller than the kraftwerken .
these are energiefarmen , you &apos;re talking about lots of quadratkilometern times more than a normal power plant .
and for example , these vents .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , it doesn &apos;t seem every day , and it doesn &apos;t also blows the wind all the time .
that &apos;s why if you depend on these sources , you have a way to get the energy in times , if you can &apos;t get available .
so there &apos;s big preisherausforderungen . there &apos;s challenges on the transmission , and if we say , it &apos;s the energy of energy outside of the country , they don &apos;t only need the technology , they have to deal with the risk that the energy from where comes from .
and there is lagerungsproblem .
and in order to show , i have all kinds of batteries that are made , looked at this : the autos , computers , the computer cell phones , for everything . and i &apos;ve got a lot of electronic energy , which is using the world , and i found out that all the batteries that we now produce , less than 10 minutes of gesamtenergie camps .
so , we need a big breakthrough , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of 100 times than the approaches to the time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
this is what happens when you &apos;re trying to get these unterbrochenen sources over say 20 percent -- 30 percent .
if you want to run 100 percent on it , you need an incredible wunderbatterie .
now , where should we go , what is the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project , &quot; how do we get to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies that work on it . hundreds .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
in many , they will say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think in the ted group here in the ted , there are many things there .
bill big has several companies , among other people who have the great solarthermaltechnologien .
vinod khosla in dozens of companies spend the great things , and i &apos;m trying to support this .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company , which , maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in nuklearbereich ; modular , liquid .
development has stopped in this industry at some time , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts around them .
the terrapower-konzept means that instead of the part of the urans , which is one percent , we decided to burn the 99 percent , we decided to burn the 99 percent .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you had a long time , but you could never have been thought about whether it , but then you could have a modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that : yes , with the right materialienherangehensweise , it looks like that .
and because you burn this 99 percent , the kostenprofil is much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s reactors as a antriebsstoff .
instead of breaking your head , you just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is consumed gradually , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often as &quot; the wandernde wave . &quot;
that really solves the treibstoffproblem .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you &apos;ve got the part that &apos;s going to be burned today , so it &apos;s called aufgebrauchtes uranium .
the triebe for hundreds of years for hundreds of years .
and if you get ozeanwasser and just filtriert , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward .
let &apos;s think about how to measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we have to do , and then we talk about the zwischenschritt .
many of them are talking about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , as well as well as well , it will be agriculture , hopefully it &apos;s going to be clean and cement until then .
so , to do that 80 percent , the world countries like china , the countries like china , their elektrizitätsgeneration completely .
the other note is whether we use the null-emissionen technology , whether it &apos;s been used in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is going to be an schlüsselelement of this zeugnisses .
if we go back from there , how would the 2020 look like this ?
it should contain the two elements again .
we should use the effektivitätsmaßnahmen to get reducing reduction on the way . the less we emittieren , the lower , the co2-summe , and it &apos;s the temperature .
but in fact , this note for the things that we do , which is not completely lead to the big reduktionen , the same , or even less important as the other ones that represents the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
we need to follow these breakthroughs with vollgas , and we can measure this : in firmenzahlen , in pilotprojekten and regulierungsänderungen .
there &apos;s a lot of great books .
the al gore book , &quot; we have the choice , &quot; and david mckays &quot; the energy . &quot;
they really go through and create a framework where this can be discussed by this wide , because we need to support all sides .
there &apos;s a lot of things that come together .
this is a wish .
a very specific wish for us to invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could select the president , a vaccine , and i love this wish , or i could choose this wish , which is , halbierter energiepreis without co2 is going to be nähme that wish .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , it &apos;s going to dig between the long and the fairly small thinking , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich , and almost all of all the life of this two billion will be much worse .
so what do we have to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to use more research .
when countries go to places like koppenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
you should talk about these innovationsstrategie , and they would be shocked by just lächerlich low funds that are going to be spent for these innovative approaches .
we need marktanreize , co2 control , cap &amp; amp ; trade is something that creates a preissignal .
we need to spread the message .
we need to lead to dialogue and all lead , and the things that are going to be done by the government .
it &apos;s a very important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you !
thank you . just to understand a little bit better -- first of all , can you give us an idea of scale of that investment ?
bill gates : to get the simulation on a supercomputer , all of the great scientists that we have , we only need a couple of 10 . and even if we test our materials in a russian reactor , to make sure that it works , it &apos;s only in the 100en million .
the hard step is building the first reaktors , to find another billion , the regularien and the place that actually builds the first of it .
when the first thing is done when the first thing was done , if he &apos;s going on the way , it &apos;s all right , because the energy density , the energy density is as different as nuklearenergie , as we know it .
to understand that , it means deep to build deep in the ground almost like an vertical column column of the nuclear energy , that consumed , and then the process begins , and then you continue to go down ?
bg : right . now , you have to reinvent the reactor , so there are many people and lots of control that can go wrong . this thing where you open it and sachen or herausbringt or herausbringt . it &apos;s not good !
but if you have a very cheap fuel , you can put it for 60 years -- think about a column that you buried , without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there , and it &apos;s done 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a nuklearreaktor that gives itself a solution to the trash .
bg : yeah . now , what happens to the waste : you can leave it -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the waste that already exists in these kühlbecken or trockenbehältern in the reactors . that &apos;s our startbrennstoff .
so what &apos;s a problem for these reactors , which was what we fill in it , and it will dramatically reduce dramatically during that process .
but while you &apos;ve been talking with different people of this world .
where is the biggest interest , what really does it do ?
bg : now we don &apos;t have a place on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting offenlegungsregeln for anything that &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name -- there are big interest and the people of the company in russia , india , china -- i &apos;ve been here and talked to the energieminister and talk about how to fit this .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the direction .
this is a version of the thing that was made .
so this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster step forward , and some countries have built , so that &apos;s why anyone who did a fast reactor , a kandidatat for our first .
in their mind , zeitrahmen and less likely to go into life ?
bg : now we need one of those skalierbaren , stromgenerierenden things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years .
this is kind of the deadline that we have shown us to follow .
and , you know , terrapower , if everything is going well , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of the ones that , if they work to work for their pilots , works for their pilots .
and it would be the best when it could do multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
so the big possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
bg : a energiedurchbruch is the most important thing .
it would be without the umweltherausforderung , but it &apos;s so much more important .
there are other innovation in the nuclear sector .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as good as these , but there &apos;s the modulare way , which is another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid reaktortyp , which seems to be hard , but maybe that &apos;s about us .
and so the beauty of it is , a million times a million times that a million times that a million times the energy , which is a million times a million times like one , say , is a million a million times the radiation , and the costs , the footprint , and the cost the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in the liga .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what then ?
do we have to introduce notfallmaßnahmen to try to keep the erdtemperatur stable ?
bg : if you get into this situation , it &apos;s like to eat too much , and just in front of a heart attack , what do you do ? you might need a herzoperation or something like that .
there &apos;s a forschungsrichtung called geoengineering that &apos;s called geoengineering , with various techniques to verzögern the warming , so we were going to be given 20 or 30 years .
this is just a versicherungsmethode .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you don &apos;t even work on insurance because you &apos;re eating that maybe , because you know , because you know , because you know , you know , you know , that one is going to save .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you go to the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a conversation in geoengineering about whether you should have available , if things are going to come faster , or that innovation takes longer than we expect .
klimaskeptiker : do you have a or two sentences for you to possibly convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptiker live in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there are negative impacts to do with the clouds that are moving things ?
there are very , very few things you can tell at all that there is a chance in a million .
the hauptproblem here is similar to aids .
you &apos;re making the mistake , and you &apos;re going to get a lot later .
and so the idea , if you have all kinds of things that you &apos;ve got to invest in something like , if you have all kinds of things that you do , in something that is that the investment is , in fact , the investment is not necessarily the worst , and there are people in the rich world that will look at the ipcc and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that these uncertainty should be worried .
but my dream here is that when you can make economic economic , and then you can do it , in the same time , you know , , you know , you know , that it &apos;s not co2 , i wish that it &apos;s done , but i &apos;ll probably accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be your answer to the björn lomborg argument that , if you use all of this time and energy to solve the co2 , the armutsverringerung , which is that if you use of malaria , and so on that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources to invest money , while there are better things that we can do .
bg : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than they do today -- that &apos;s not that dramatic .
among other things not suffer .
you get to big geldsummen , and here you can disagree with a reasonable people , if you have something that is not economic , and it &apos;s trying to fund , for me , most of waste .
it was because you &apos;re very , very quickly in front of a kostendurchbruch and funded , and i think we should try and have more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if you get that you get , a very high energiepreis , then you can only keep up the rich .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing our lifestyle .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even lomborg thinks .
his new masche is now , &quot; why don &apos;t the research happen anymore ? &quot;
it &apos;s still going to be because of his former stories , with the skeptiker-camp associated with the skeptiker-camp , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why he &apos;s going to get the forschungsargument .
and this is a school that i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , it .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost all the people here , when i say , i really hope that your wish will be true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter skillman einen a design-wettbewerb called &quot; the marshmallow-herausforderung . &quot;
the idea is quite simple . vierer-teams must have to have the vast possible structure with 20 spaghetti , about three feet of tape , and build a short marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on top of it .
and , even though it seems , it it &apos;s really hard , because people are pushing very fast to work very quickly .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design-workshop .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops worldwide , with students , developers and architects , even with ctos , and there &apos;s something about that task , which allows the deep sensations in nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them .
normally , most people are starting to take themselves on the task .
they talk about how it looks like it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to look like it .
then they invest a little time in planning planning and organization . they draw and put spaghetti spaghetti .
they invest most of their time in the zusammenbau .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow , and you put it gently down to the top , step back and &quot; ta-da ! admire your work .
but then , almost always , is that the &quot; ta-da &quot; to a &quot; uh-oh &quot; because the weight of the marshmallows does is that the whole thing is verbiegt and einstürzt .
there &apos;s a series of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh &quot; as others , and under the worst are fresh bwl-absolventen .
they lie , they &apos;re cheating , they &apos;re confused and producing really dürftige shapes .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta-da , &quot; and under the best , new members of the kindergartens .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us peter , they &apos;re not just producing the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you may be asking is : how does that come ? why ? what about that ?
and peter talks , &quot; none of the kids spend time in the head of spaghetti gmbh .
they don &apos;t invest time in machtkämpfe .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that bwl-studenten were trained to find a proper plan , ok !
and then realize it .
what happens if you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what makes kindergartenkinder different is that you start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so that they have mehrfach prototype to repair prototypes .
konstrukteure recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of a iterativen vorgangs .
and with each try , the kids get immediate feedback , and what doesn &apos;t work .
this is how the performance of working with prototypes , much -- but let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
the average for most of the time is about 50cm , bwl-studenten create half of them , but not much more , but not much , they &apos;re better than adults .
who &apos;s most successful ?
architects and engineers , to happiness .
three feet is the highest thing i saw .
and why ? because they can understand triangles and sich-selbst-verstärkende geometric patterns are the key to build stable structures .
ceos are something about average . but here it will be interesting .
put a exekutive administrator on the team , they become significant better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see around and see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
because they have special skills of prozessbegleitung .
they run the process , they understand it .
and this team that regelt and to work on work is going to improve the performance of the team significant .
specialized skills and prozessfähigkeiten and their combination leads to success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical thing , they get about six that have stable structures .
i tried something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s get the pokereinsatz .
so i offered a $ 10000 prize to software for the winner .
what happened to these design-studenten ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if someone had built a 2,5cm high construction , he would have carried the price home .
isn &apos;t it interesting that high wetteinsätze have a strong effect ?
we started doing this practice with the same student .
what happened now ?
now they understood the advantage of the prototyping .
so in the same , bad team , a bad team .
they produced the highest construction at all time .
so there are tief-greifende lessons for us , about the nature of momentum and success .
you might ask , why would anyone actually spend time to invest a marshmallow-challenge ?
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and &quot; visual effects . &quot;
and what the marshmallow-challenge is doing is she helps to identify with them .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a common experience , a common language , or position to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , that simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in interessiert can visit marshmallowchallenge.com .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how you build the marshmallows .
there &apos;s a schritt-für-schritt-anleitung there .
you find crazy examples out of all the world , how people optimize the system and raffinieren the system .
there are also weltrekorde .
and the basale lesson , i think , is actually a verbindender sport .
it requires us all our senses to fix the task , and that we think we &apos;re going to think of our thinking , how our emotions and our do , in the challenge that lies in front of us .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything that it takes us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; -- to a &quot; ta-da .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
we as if we had a machine here .
a big machine , a cool , ted-artige machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to put in .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what you would choose because i &apos;ve asked my friends last time , and they wanted to go all in the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america &apos;s looking for the superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i believe that you &apos;re sort of nostalgie to the nostalgie .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to be in the past , and not because i &apos;m an abenteurer .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the greatest time that we have ever on the planet , no matter how to scale , health , wealth , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining , declining krankheitsraten .
there was never a time .
my ur-großeltern died all of them when they were 60 .
my grandparents drängten that number on 70. .
my parents are 80 on the fersen .
so there &apos;s better a nine at the beginning of my todeszahl .
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a kid that is born today in new delhi can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox have billions of people on this planet .
they have shaped the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we &apos;ve got them bezwungen .
in the rich world there are diseases that millions of us have been threatened by only one generation , not yet .
diphterie , röteln , kinderlähmung ...
does anybody know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that &apos;s the scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and see if it works , change if it doesn &apos;t , one of the great achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , this is all the good news , because there &apos;s a couple of other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , despite all of our achievements , one billion people are hungry world hungry every day .
this number goes up , and it goes up very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to verwüsten this world .
water , urbares country , the oil , oil , oil , gas : they disappear , and it &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t get rid of that chaos , we also disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i &apos;m thinking .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people , without the country that they live on , to rape .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t zerstört them at the same time .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a wunschdenken .
but this is keeping me awake at night -- one of the things that hold me up at night -- we &apos;ve never had scientific progress .
and we &apos;ve never been able to do it as well as we can today .
and we &apos;re really amazing , amazing events on many places , and yet i really think that we had to go back hundreds of years before the enlightenment that we have to fight progress in which we have to fight progress in which we have heftiger about these things , in more front than now .
people hüllen themselves in their faith , and that &apos;s so deeply that you can &apos;t free it .
it &apos;s not even the truth .
and listen , everybody has a right to his opinion ; even a right to his opinion .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t have a right on their own facts . &apos; tschuldigung , they don &apos;t .
and i took a while to figure out that .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed to stoßen on resistance , to resistance to the most effective activity in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i did just do what i &apos;m doing , i wrote an article and drove on .
and soon , i wrote an article about gentechnisch nahrungsmittel food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i wrote an article , and i didn &apos;t understand why people thought this would be &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why they believed that molecules are a random kind of random kind of herumzuschieben in the area of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i went on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re going to eat , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but these articles made me worry , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally i found it .
and that &apos;s because these fanatiker that made me crazy didn &apos;t even have been fanatiker at all .
these were umsichtige people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that durcheinander me .
but then i thought , you know what we are honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress , like earlier .
we &apos;re talking about zwiespältig .
we &apos;re talking about the ironic , with little quote , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , so there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what &apos;s the reasons .
we have the faith in institutions , authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it should not be .
you can just call a couple of names and people will understand .
chernobyl , bhopal , the challenger , mass destruction , the us-präsidentschaftswahl , the us-präsidentschaftswahl .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we thought they were right , and so they were skeptical .
ask , ask the evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take it down .
but it &apos;s going to be : if you get evidence that you have to take the evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can say that from the reason that we &apos;re now living in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story , which autismus-epidemie the autismus-epidemie , mumps , mumps , and röteln vaccine .
very scary .
tons of studies were done to see if that was true .
tons of studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , in england , from canada , from canada , and they were all the same , no connection , no connection , no .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see to see what makes us feel that we feel that we feel .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents from a regierungsangstellten that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was catastrophic .
catastrophic because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the impfrate is falling down .
this is skandalös , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what happened is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do that .
this is somebody here ?
does one in the audience ever see anyone in the audience ?
not very often happens .
in this country , in this country doesn &apos;t happen at all , in this country , in the last year .
that &apos;s a lot of death , 20 per hour .
but because this is not what happens , we can in denial , and people like jenny can mccarthy around and analphabetismus messages like oprah and larry king live preach .
and they can do that because they can &apos;t connect the cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same thing .
and this is something that we need to learn , and that &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he befreite us from one of the worst geißeln of humanity .
no fear , no qualen , kinderlähmung , puff .
the guy in the middle not so much .
he &apos;s called paul offit .
he just evolved with a few other people .
he can save the lives of 400- , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , that &apos;s good , besides that paul &apos;s talking and vaccines about vaccines vaccines and says , how valuable are , and that people should just stop jammern .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul is talking to paul in a public anhörung , he can &apos;t tell aussagen .
he gets phone calls home , because people like to tell him where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
take them on , they go back , they go back , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we &apos;ve been masern in this country .
and that &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids will die , because it &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not going to die .
what about kinderlähmung ? do we do it . why not ?
a kommilitonin i wrote a few weeks ago , and i said , i &apos;m a little to schrill .
nobody said it ever before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate your child against kinderlähmung . no way .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have kinderlähmung . and you know what ?
we had no kinderlähmung in this country yesterday .
now , i don &apos;t know , maybe this morning , you know , someone in lagos in a plane , and flies to los angeles , at the moment he &apos;s about ohio .
and it ends up in a few hours and mietet a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these fantastichen ted-dinner tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a lähmenden disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because this is how the world works .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love to lie on hüllen . we love .
did you all have vitamins that morning ?
echinacea , a little antioxidantium , that helps you .
i know they did that because half the americans do every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data is all the time .
they make their urine . they &apos;re almost never .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with them .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do this ?
well , i think i understand -- we want the drug industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and seelentötend even to us that can afford .
so we go away before , and where do we walk ?
we &apos;re running into the arms of the placebo-industrie .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo-industrie .
but you know , this is really a serious issue , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars for it .
and i &apos;ve got all kinds of little requisiten here .
none of them -- gingko , was echinacea , echinacea , of course , acai , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we give billions of dollars for it , it is .
and you know what ? if i say that , people shout me and say , &quot; what do you care about ? let people do what you want .
so they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter , whether it &apos;s the gesundheitsminister , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to not take the evidence of my experts , &quot; or some krebs-quacksalber , who &apos;s trying to treat his patients .
if you go to that way , where belief and magic is replacing some evidence , you get a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
he brought 400,000 people around , because he was that it was that red beete , knoblauch and more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can break the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of unnötiger deaths in a country that &apos;s worse than any other one of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they always have .
now , the hirnloseste epidemic , where we &apos;re right now , is this absurde struggle between the befürwortern gentechnisch food and the bio-elite .
this is a idiotische debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
all we eat , every reiskorn , every branch , every branch , every rosenkohl , was changed by people .
you know , there were no mandarinen in paradise .
there was no cantaloupe-melonen .
there was no weihnachtsbäume . we did it all .
we &apos;ve done it in the last year .
and some of it works , and some of it doesn &apos;t work .
we get rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can make it closer . and of course , of course , there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , to increase their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we lehnen nahrung .
why do we do that ?
well , what i &apos;m listening to all the time is , too many chemicals , pesticides , pesticides hormones , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing , which is wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies patent life .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yes , you &apos;re right . fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge nahrungsproblem , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , patentkram .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid to be a dead end , and it holds millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than right now . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? genetically changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat stuff , like maniok .
maniok is something that a half a billion people .
it &apos;s like an potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists build all this in it .
and then people could do the food and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
you wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be chez , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say is , why do we fight that ?
i mean , we ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want a genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our beharren , better food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice krispies , it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s going to be time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we keep doing so far as we do , we do something guilty of something that we do , i think , not want to be guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we really have to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you may want to say , &quot; do you still want to go into this ridiculous time and go to the future ? &quot;
anyway . i want to do that .
right now , you &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can make this time machine on everything we want .
we can hinbewegen them where we want to hinbewegen them , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want .
we have to take these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to time time and go to the future , we &apos;ll be happy .
i know that we can , as far as far as it is , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;ve been interested in placebo-effekt . it may seem strange that a magician was interested in this , because , you look at it as i like , &quot; a deception that will be a real thing , if somebody believes enough . &quot;
so in some studies , in some studies , in some studies , in some studies , in some studies , in some studies , have shown a measurable effect in some studies , or a kind of ... in schmerzmanagement , for example , if the patient only is enough enough enough enough , is an impact in the body that &apos;s called the placebo-effekt .
a deception is going to be something real , because somebody recognizes it .
so let us understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . that &apos;s a trick that has at least since the 1950s is in every 1950s for children .
i myself learned him from the cub scout magic in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , you see what happens .
the knife that you can study ; my hand that you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my hand .
i get my sleeves back .
and to make sure that there &apos;s nothing in my ärmel or coming out of him , i &apos;m just going to take my wrist here .
you can see that you can see that doesn &apos;t move any time . so as long as i zudrücke here , i can &apos;t go into my sleeve or come out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully when everything is good , the knife will held through my naked physical körperlichen .
it &apos;s actually sitting in the place that i can shake it without the knife .
nothing goes into my sleeves or coming out , no trickserei . and you can study everything .
ta-da !
well , this is a trick that i often care about little kids who care about magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you look at it , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you know many of you here in the room here in the room .
it works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to say that i &apos;m my wrist umschließe to make sure that nothing in my car disappears or coming out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason why i mean my wrist festhalte , is that there is the secret to the illusion .
and in the moment , where i mean , where i &apos;m going to tell my hand from the back of you in the back of the back here , this finger is just from where it was , in a position that &apos;s so ausgestreckt .
great trick ?
there was someone sitting in the back there .
so , it &apos;s here . right .
and if i umdrehe , the fingers changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there &apos;s just three fingers down here , because the mind and the way he process information is that it doesn &apos;t count information , one , two , two , three , but it &apos;s seen as a group .
but that &apos;s not actually going to be here , and then i open my hand .
of course , it will lay out there , but not through the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my zeigefinger , which is now .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by ich , by this movement , that the fingers is coming back .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
you can demonstrate this trick and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo-effekt ?
a year ago or so , i read a study that was really umgehauen me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and so it was an amazing thing for me .
that &apos;s what it turns out is , if you have a placebo against a white pill in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a particular measurable effect .
but if you put the shape in which you &apos;re going to give it against placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and that blue color and shape a letter , it &apos;s actually measurable more effective .
and that , although any of any pharmazeutische -- it &apos;s just zuckerpillen .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that made me freak out .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
if you take tiny , it &apos;s more more effective than any shape .
now , a colored kapsel which is in yellow and the other red , is better than a white .
it &apos;s also playing a role .
a pill is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s also the dosierungen play a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo-effekt , you have to reach the needle .
right ? a syringe with a wirkungslosen -- a few of the wirkungslosen substance substance that you get into a patient .
it creates a very strong image in your head . that &apos;s much more powerful than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time if we have a projektor .
so the fact is that the white pill not as well as the blue pill , which doesn &apos;t seem as good as well as a capsule , which is not as good as well as the needle .
and none of it has any really pharmazeutische property . it &apos;s just our faith in which we do a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i suppose something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let it look real .
we know from that study that you have to reach into the needle if it &apos;s supposed to go .
this is a cm long time . she &apos;s very , very , very , very spitz . and i &apos;m going to take you a little bit of sterilisieren .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not damians special spezielles meat meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
now , i &apos;m going to stick this needle in my skin , and move through it until you go back to the other side .
if you &apos;re going to be nice , if you fall out of it -- if you fall out -- i have a few friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s a woman almost ohnmächtig .
so i &apos;m going to suggest , if you &apos;re going to look quickly , look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first sensitive part of the back here .
you can see it in the same , but you can also wegsehen if you want .
so , it goes , right here , right here where my flesh starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little einstich .
i &apos;m really sorry . does it make it crazy ?
and just a little bit of my skin and on the other side , and on the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation we had in the messertrick .
about it .
but now they can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s certainly not such dumb and durchsticht itself , just to talk for a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this right . &quot;
people in the nebenräumen are coming in now .
let me show you out there .
that &apos;s my skin . it &apos;s not a special effect of hollywood .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can herumdrehen .
sorry . if you get evil , look away , look away , don &apos;t look .
and the people in the back , or the ones that you see at some point at a video , will say , &quot; well , you know , this is pretty impressive , but if it was real , he would -- you see , here &apos;s a hole and there , if it really would be really true . &quot;
okay , so let me make a little blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
i usually would take the needle now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wunden .
but i think in this frame , and with the purpose of doing something real , i &apos;m going to leave the needle needle in there and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to meet a few times in the next days .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness today .
i have some people the number of books the number of books in the last five years , and they were published after about 40 at about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness .
there &apos;s a lot of glücks-coaching .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all this tide of work , there are several cognitive falling , which it sort of almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is going to be mainly about these cognitive .
that &apos;s true for laien that you think about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are exactly what everybody else .
the first one of these fallen is a widerstreben , complexity .
it turns out that the word is simply not a word of happiness because we &apos;re applying to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we could narrow it on , but in the big one , it &apos;s something that we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second trap is kindness of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s between happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both zusammengeworfen in the idea of happiness .
and the third one is the konzentrations-illusion , and that &apos;s the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that we can think about a situation that affects well-being , without its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i would like to start with an example of someone who was berichtete a story after one of my lectures , who was covering a story , and he said he had a symphony symphony , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and at the end of the recording , there was a fürchterliches kreischendes sound .
and then he added , really very emotional , that &apos;s ruined the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what ruins the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of herrlicher music .
they don &apos;t count because he was a memory of verblieben ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had .
what we really say is that we might be thinking about ourselves and thinking about other people in the sense of self .
there &apos;s a erlebendes self that lives in the present and knows the present , is able to experience the past , but basically has the present .
it &apos;s the erlebende self that the doctor anpricht -- you know , if the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt if i &apos;m anfasse you ? &quot;
and then there is a erinnerndes self , and the erinnernde self is that the mitzählt and the story of our lives , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor &apos;s physician by asking the doctor , &quot; how did you feel the last time ? &quot;
or , &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units that erlebende itself and the erinnernde itself , and the two of them is part of the durcheinanders of happiness .
well , the erinnernde self is a storyteller .
and this is really beginning with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories if we &apos;re making stories to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories that means what we need to keep our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who put a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go to the detail . she &apos;s not painful , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about her pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who &apos;s suffered from two ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has been clearly more suffering . his darmspiegelung was more , and every minute of pain , the patient a had patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient has a much worse to be a much worse erinnrung .
the stories of the darmspiegelungen were different , and because it &apos;s a very important part of history , as it ends .
and none of these stories is very erbaulich or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is far worse than the other .
and the one that was worse , where the pain was at the end at the end , it was a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their darmspiegelung , and too much later , &quot; how bad was all the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than for b in erinnrung .
now this is a direct direct conflict between the erlebenden self and the erinnernden itself .
from the erlebenden self , b clearly had a worse time .
well , what you could do with patient a is , and we actually did experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually be able to make the darmspiegelung of the patient , you just put the tube in it without sehr .
that will lead to the patient &apos;s suffering , but just a bit less than a bit less than before .
and if you do this for a few minutes , you can make that the erlebende itself is a worse , and you have made that the erinnernde self is a much better it , because now you &apos;ve given a patient a better story about its experience .
what is a story ?
and this is true for the stories that offers us and it &apos;s true for the stories we invent .
so what a story is , umbrüche , significant , significant moments and end .
they &apos;re very , very important , and in this case , the end of the end .
well , the erlebende itself lives constantly alive .
it &apos;s having moments of the erlebens , one after another .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
and i mean , most moments of our life -- and i mean , you know , most moments of our lives -- and i think that -- you know , the psychological present for about three seconds , which means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a month . most of them don &apos;t leave behind .
most of them are completely ignored by the erinnernden self .
and yet , somehow you get the impression that you should count that what these moments of erlebens is happening in our lives .
it &apos;s a finite resource that we use as we &apos;re in the world .
and how we would use it to seem to be important , but this is not the story that keeps the erinnernde itself .
so we have the erinnernde self , and the erlebende self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is to deal with time .
if you have a holiday , if you have a holiday , and the second week is just as well as the first one , then the zweiwöchige vacation is twice as good as the einwöchige vacation .
it doesn &apos;t work at all for the erinnernde self .
for the erinnernde self , a holiday is hardly much better than the einwöchige vacation , because there are no new memories being added .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is the critical variable that a erinnerndes itself is different from a erlebenden self . time has a lot of influence on this story .
well , the erinnernde self makes more than remember and stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who &apos;s going to make decisions , because if you have two darmspiegelungen in two different surgeons , and what he should choose to choose , is the one who &apos;s memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be selected .
the erlebende self has no voice in that choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t actually choose between experience . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future as vorausgesehene memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , you know , as a tyrannei , you know , and you can think of the erinnernde itself as one , sort of the erlebende self through experience that doesn &apos;t need the erlebende itself .
i have the impression that if we make a holiday , that &apos;s the case that we &apos;re doing a holiday urlaub in the service of the erinnernden self .
and this is a little bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we have our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s given to the dominance of the erinnernden itself .
and when i think about it , i think about a holiday that we &apos;ve ever done in antarctica a few years ago , which was clearly the best vacation i had ever had , and i think pretty much about how often i think about other urlaube .
and i probably have some of my memories of this dreiwöchige journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i &apos;d ever opened the folder in the folder , i &apos;d spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s five and a half hours .
there seems to be a dissonance .
well , i may be a little extreme , you know , how little appetit i have on the zehren of memories , but even if you make more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give memories so much weight in the verlgeich of the weight that we give experiences ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the urlaubs , all your pictures will be wiped out , and you get a amnestisches drug , so they &apos;re going to remember nothing .
well , would you choose the same holiday ?
and if you choose a holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species of self , and you have to think about how you choose this conflict , and it &apos;s not obvious at all , because if you think in the sense of time , you get an answer , and if you think of your memories , you might have a different answer .
why we pick up the urlaube , which we pick up a problem is a problem that we have a problem with the two types of self .
well , the two kinds of self werfen two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the erlebende self ?
and then you &apos;d ask : how happy are the moments in the life of the erlebenden itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea to get from the very good idea of the erlebenden itself over time .
if you ask the happiness of the erinnernden self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
that &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted the person is when this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
every one who is not different from happiness , and i &apos;m one of researchers on well-being , and i &apos;m one of researchers about happiness , for happiness , for happiness .
the distinction between the happiness of the erlebenden self , and the happiness of the erinnernden self has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separat .
the world organization has a local survey , over the more than half a million people have been asking about what they think about their lives , and their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started to learn about the happiness of the self .
and the main lesson that we think , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how someone with his life is , and it doesn &apos;t really teach them how happy he lives his life and versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about .5 .
what that means is that if you would meet someone and you would tell them , oh , dad is a zwei-meter-mann , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you &apos;d know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
when i tell you that somebody &apos;s life as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he &apos;s with his erlebenden self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what happiness is determined .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know happiness is mostly happy to be content with people that we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you &apos;re fortunate to maximize the two kinds of the self you &apos;re going to do very different things .
so the implication of what i said here is that we really don &apos;t think of happiness as a ersatz replacement for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very quickly , one of the reasons we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we &apos;re not looking at the same things when we think about life and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask this question , you think that people in california have to be happier if you , let &apos;s live in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference , let &apos;s say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the erlebende self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the nachdenkliche self that decides how happy people are .
but now , because the nachdenkliche self is responsible , you can end up -- some people could end up with california .
and it &apos;s kind of to pursue what happens to people who are moving to california in hope to be happier .
well , your erlebendes itself will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think that you &apos;re happier , because if you &apos;re going to think about it , how terrible the weather in ohio was in ohio , and you will feel that you &apos;ve got the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve got a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question to you .
thank you .
now , when we talked about a few weeks ago , i talked about the phone that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this place .
is this something you can let us share with , because you now have a few minutes left ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
i think the most interesting thing that we &apos;ve found in the place is a number that we &apos;ve absolutely not expected to find .
we found this in terms of happiness .
when we look at how feelings vary income .
and it turns out that under one income for 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a large representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they become increasingly less less happy , the poorer .
we get a absolutely flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw that flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money is not buying a erlebnis-glück , but that lack of money is certainly elend , and we can measure this misery , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the erinnernden self , you get another story .
the more money you deserve is happier .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , all the american commitment is about life , freedom , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this befund seriously , i mean , it seems to ask all the head , everything we believe , for example , in terms of steuerpolitik and so on .
is there a chance that politicians that the country would actually take a befund like this , and make politics based on politics ?
dk : you know , i think that there &apos;s recognition for the role of glücksforschung in politics .
the recognition will slowly be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , they just happened and in other countries , they just happened .
people are doing it , admit that you should think of happiness if you think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to explore whether they want to study erlebnis-glück or whether they want to study lebens-bewertung , so we need to have this discussion very soon .
how to increase happiness can be very different depending on how they think and whether they think about the erinnernde themselves or whether they think about the erlebende themselves .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think in the years .
in the united states , you &apos;ve got to measure the erlebnis-glück of the population .
that &apos;s going to be , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this topic , or at least the most interesting political debate for the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny kahneman .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to do it as easy to save the world in reality , as it is to save in online-spielen .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of them , spend more time with play greater and tollerer games .
currently we spend three billion hours a week with online-spielen .
some of you may think , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe a little too much time , if you think about how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
but in fact , in fact , my research at the institute of the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most problems of the world .
in fact , i believe that if we &apos;re going to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase that way dramatically .
i &apos;ve calculate that it took time for 21 billion hours a week .
that &apos;s what i think first is something that you , if we have problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we &apos;ve got to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the decade .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture describes very precisely why i believe that games are so critical for survival human species . seriously .
this is a portrait of fotografen phil toledano .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play . so he built a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classical expressions playing .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe some of the nuances in this picture .
you &apos;re probably seeing this sense of urgency , something fear , but also all of all of them , in fact , to solve a very difficult problem .
now , if you play , you know , you know , some nuances here , the top of the augen eyes , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
and this is a player on the edge of something called epischen sieges .
oh , you know this . ok . so we have some players here .
a epischer victory is a result that is so much positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and when they do it , they &apos;re shocked that they &apos;re actually able to do something like this . that &apos;s a epischer victory .
this player is just a epischen victory .
and this is what we have to see on millions of faces around the world , if we have to take the barriers of the next century , and the face of those who are on the edge of a epischen sieges .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re going to see this face in real life when we face difficult problems .
i call it the &quot; in life , &quot; i &apos;m bad , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , do you see ? yes ? ok .
this is me , how i &apos;m doing that in life , i &apos;m bad .
this is an graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i was studying how we &apos;re in playing better than in the real life .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good as good games .
and i mean not just less successful , even though that &apos;s what it is .
we &apos;re going to reach more in spielwelten . i mean , in the context of motivation , to do something more bedeutsames , inspired with each other .
if we &apos;re in a spielwelt , i believe that many of us turn into our best version , anytime and allowed to be helpful to try to solve the problem , as long as they need to go back again .
and in reality , if we &apos;re failing , when we run on obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we &apos;re deeply threatened . we feel threatened , we feel threatened , perhaps depressed , frustrated or zynisch .
these feelings we never have , if we play games , they just don &apos;t .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible in games to think , you can &apos;t just achieve everything ?
how can we transfer these feelings to reality ?
so i started playing games like world of warcraft the ideal of the ideal problem problem .
and i &apos;ve noticed some things that are made in online-welten in online-welten .
so , first of all , if you get into one of these online-spiele , especially at the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters who are willing to give you a weltrettende mission , and immediately .
but not only any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level in the game , right ?
so they do that .
you never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their capabilities , so they have to succeed , but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and dreht . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are tons of collaborators .
where you go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them , to end their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that easy in real life , that feeling that there are tons of lots of people who are ready .
there &apos;s also this epic story , this inspiring inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get all this feedback feedback .
they &apos;re defined by &quot; level up &quot; and &quot; + a stärke &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
that constant feedback is not in real life .
if i &apos;m going to leave this stage , i don &apos;t have a talk to + , and + a + idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
so , the problem of kooperations-online-welten like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at any time of a epischen sieges , that we rather spend our time in these spielwelten .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all of the world of warcraft-spieler have spent 5,93 million years to solve the virtual problems of azeroth .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it may sound nice .
but to see it in the context , 5,93 million years ago , our first primatenvorfahren began to go upright .
so the first floating primate primate .
ok , so , if we talk about how much time we &apos;re playing with play , it makes the only point when you think about the amount of human development of human development , which is extraordinary .
but as it turns out , because it turns out , by using this time we &apos;re using all the time to play , in fact , change what we are able to do as humans .
we &apos;re developing the collaborative thinking , so many creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i think that .
look at this interesting statistic that was recently published by carnegie mellon mellon university , the average man from today , in a country , in a country , has 10,000 hours spent 10,000 hours with online-spielen to the 21st of year .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , 10.080 hours are the exact gesamtzeit that they spend in school , from the five to high school -- if you never miss .
so we have a complete parallelbildungsweg , in the young human people , what it means to be a good player , how everything else they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; überflieger . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success for 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the kognitivwissenschaft that when we spend 10,000 hours of any subject to the 21st age of any matter to the 21st of the 21st , we &apos;re going to do it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at whatever the most significant people in the world .
so , what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are meister-spieler .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players meisterhaft good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have basically never been able to have gewesenes human potential .
so many people , right now , we have at least one hour per day with online-spielen .
these are our meister-spieler . 500 million people , which are extraordinary in something .
and in the next decade , we have another billion players that are extraordinarily good at whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the spieleindustrie evolved to save energy and are working on mobilfunknetzen , instead of the breitband-internet , so that players around the world , especially in india , china , can play online .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is , what we &apos;re doing .
here are the 4 things that i found . first , dringlichkeits-optimismus .
ok , imagine how extreme selbstmotivierung .
dringlichkeits-optimismus is the desire to do that immediately , a challenge , with the belief that we have an early hope of success .
people always believe that a epischer victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to try and be a moment .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in the spiders of social sozialer .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show that we like that we &apos;ve played people more after we &apos;ve played with them , even if they defeated us serious .
the reason it is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that there &apos;s a time to talk to us that the rules are going to be eingehalten , that we have the same goal and keep going on .
so this is what you can do by bonds , trust and each other .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
glückselige productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the durchschnitts-word of warcraft-spieler is playing 22 hours a week , as a teilzeitjob .
the reason is that if we play , we are actually happier to work hard than if we relax or not do anything .
we know that as human being human beings , as human beings , if we do hard to do great work .
and players are always willing to work hard if they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love it to be part of awe of gebietender missions .
here &apos;s a hintergrundinformation , to the right light , and you know , you know all wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
the second largest wiki of the world , with almost 80,000 einträgen , is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about world of warcraft in the internet than any other topic in every other wiki of the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome . players are super-mächtige , hopeful .
these are people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is they believe they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward castronova is a volkswissenschaftler .
his work is awesome . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in online-welten .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to see less than a massenemigration in virtual worlds and online-spielumgebungen . &quot;
and that &apos;s from an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not as i ... i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit of überschwänglich .
so he says that makes sense , because players can achieve more in online-welten than in the real life .
they can make stronger social bonds than in real life , and they get more feedback and rewards in games than in real life .
so , he says , it &apos;s now completely logical that players spend more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
i just agree with that , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not optimalsituation .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event for 2,500 years .
there &apos;s these ancient cube , from schafsknöcheln . you know ?
before these amazing spielecontrollern , there were schafsknöchel .
and these were kind of the first of people developed spielgeräte .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the ancient greek historikers , you may know that story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to herodotus , games were invented , more würfelspiele , in the kingdom of lydien during famine .
so there were such great famine that the king of lydien would decided to a crazy idea .
people were suffering .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to herodotus , the würfelspiel and a national strategy , you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be that very fascinating to be so fascinating , because games are so fascinating , and with befriedigender , glückseliger productivity that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to herodotus survived , they survived these famine for 18 years , by eating them in a day .
so , i think we &apos;re going to play games today .
we &apos;re playing games to get the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re playing games to avoid everything that in the real world , it doesn &apos;t work in the real life , and we &apos;ll get what we need to play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to 18 years , famine wasn &apos;t much better . so i decided the king of the king , was a last würfelspiel anzusetzen .
they shared the kingdom in two camps .
they were playing a würfelspiel and the best were allowed to a epischen adventure .
they left , and they went looking for a new home , and they had so many people , how there was food to survive , and were looking for the rest of an area that they can flourish .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest dna-beweise show that the etrusker , which is later the roman empire , that have the same dna as the old lydier .
and so scientists , scientists recently , scientists recently is that herodotus &apos;s crazy story .
and geologists found the evidence of a global abkühlung that could explain almost 20 years what might explain famine .
so this crazy story could vote .
they might have actually saved their people through play by using 18 years in games , and then they had these eingebung , and then they had this eingebung , and so much about each other , and they learned that they would have saved the entire civilization .
so we can also .
we &apos;ve been playing since 1994 .
this was the first strategiespiel in real time in the world of warcraft-serie . this was 16 years ago .
they were playing for 18 years , and we &apos;ve been 16 years of warcraft .
i want to argue , we &apos;re ready for our own episches game .
so , they sent half their civilization to search for a new world , so i suppose my 21 billion spielstunden a week .
we should be able to spend half of us an hour of a day , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of the real world in games ? &quot; and exactly this question , i have dedicated my work over the last few years for the institute for the future .
we &apos;ve got this flag in our office in palo alto , which is how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to introduce the best outcome , and then people make the best thing to make this idea of reality .
we &apos;re looking at epic siege and give people to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you just three games that i designed to try and get people to get people learning in their own future .
this is &quot; the world without oil . &quot;
the game is in 2007 .
it &apos;s a online-spiel that you have to overcome a ölknappheit .
so , you know , if you &apos;re anmelden , and it , you know , if you &apos;re anmelden , you know , if you &apos;re in your game , and you actually have enough life , you know , you know , it &apos;s geschlossen , you know , you know , you know , if you can live , and you have to figure out how to do it , and you have to figure out how you design your real life , if it was true , and we ask you to talk about this , videos or photographs .
we tested this game with corrupt players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied them over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epischen adventure , and you say , &quot; we go from oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going on .
find out how to survive , most of our players who are doing gelernten habits .
so we have a bigger game for the next weltrettende game , more and higher than just ölknappheit .
we have the game called &quot; superstruct &quot; at the institute for the future .
the point of view is the calculation of a supercomputers that people have left to the planet on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global aussterbungs- sensibilisierungs-system . &quot;
the call on the player , you know , we almost designed as a &quot; jerry-bruckheimer .
you know jerry bruckheimer-filme , where it &apos;s &quot; dream-team , &quot; you have the astronauts , the scientists , the ex-sträfling and only together , you can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , everybody in the dream-team , and it &apos;s our job , the future of energy , food , security , and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they are google .
and the last game is the third of march . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get off by the world bank , by the world bank , in 2010 .
we &apos;re working at universities in all the sub-saharan africa , and store them to learn .
we have a comic comic book . we have &quot; level high &quot; for regionales , wissensvernetzung , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people all around the world , especially in entwicklungsgebieten , who benefit from this , to imagine their own social enterprise to save the world .
i come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what , do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in the real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we &apos;ve got these superpowers , glückselige productivity productivity , the ability to build bed nets , dringlichkeits-optimismus , and the desire for epischer .
i really hope that we play to play great games to survive on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;re going to play these things like this and play .
when i go to the next decade , i &apos;m in two things : that we can create every public future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the weltverändernden .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what i &apos;d seen to you a few months ago in writing a couple months ago .
i &apos;ve always got my synonym-wörterbuch on the writing , but i was done with the text of the text , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never had my life in my life , which means &quot; disabled &quot; really means .
i &apos;ll read you the post .
&quot; behindert , helpless , zerstört , zerstört , zerstört , zerstört , zerstört , zerstört , zerstört , zerstört , zerstört , gelähmt , gelähmt , gelähmt , gelähmt , paralyzed , gelähmt , gelähmt , aus , erledigt , erledigt , kaputt , kaputt , siehe , lo and behold , lo and weak and weak .
antonyme : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
and i read this list of a friend , and i had to read this list , but i was just coming up to &quot; zugerichtet , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t stop reading , and i had to stop reading , and take me out of these überfallartigen wortflut and the emotional shock shock .
of course , this was a ausgefranstes , old synonym-wörterbuch . i just thought that the output has to be quite old .
but in fact , it was a copy in the early &apos; 80s , when i just started with elementary school and started making my sense of sense of my family outside my family , and shape , also in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god , i &apos;m not used to use .
if i was going seriously , i would be born to a world that someone like me , as a person , as a person as a person in any other way , but today i &apos;m going to have the opportunity and adventure i &apos;ve experienced .
so , i immediately got to the online-ausgabe of 2009 , and i expected to find a ansprechenderen contribution here .
here &apos;s the aktualisierte version of this eintrags .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words are under near antonyms , &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
a lot of altertümliche societies , including the greeks and the roman , have really believed that the aussprache of a fluchs has a big force , because what you ausspricht out loud is also manifestieren .
so , what do we actually want to do -- a disabled person or an powerful person ?
just to talk to a human being as a child , it could do it , einzuschränken and ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be more nice to open doors doors ?
one person who opened doors to me was my pediatrician at the a.i. institute in wilmington at delaware .
it &apos;s called dr. pizzutillo . a italo-amerikaner , whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t answer correctly . so he was always called dr. pair .
and dr. who had always carried very colorful flies , and was just for the work with children .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my physiotherapie .
so , i had a single thing to do with these obese , elastischen bändern -- in different colors -- you know , in different colors -- you know , to build my bein-muskeln , and i hated bänder than anything else . i hated them . i hated her . i hated them .
and imagine , i actually negotiate as a child with dr. pair of a child , and i tried to stop these practice , natürllich without success .
and one day he saw me at one of my practice -- these things were just tiring and gnadenlos -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so powerful , powerful and young girls , you &apos;re going to pull one one day one .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this was , of course , just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i do not want to do that , with the prospect that the richest five girls are going on in the hospital in the zweiten , but he actually brought me to see my daily übungs-horror with new eyes . so that &apos;s what a new vielversprechendes experience .
and i &apos;m wondering today , how much his vision of me is shaped as strong and powerful , and powerful girls in my sense , and i could see , as a nature of strong , powerful and atlethischen and atlethischen .
this is just one example of many , how adults can encourage the imagination of a child .
but as you can prove the synonym-wörterbüchern examples of the synonym-wörterbüchern , our language doesn &apos;t make us any room to imagine what we all wish : it would allow every single way to see itself as powerful people .
our language hinkt the social changes that have been caused by a technological change in many cases .
if you think , of course , my legs , of course , that my legs , of course , you can be , of course , is to say , of course , that my legs , the laser-chirurgie of titan and artificial hüftgelenke for aging bodies , which is , of course , not talking about the social networking platforms , and people allow people to have their own identity , in their own way , define their own identity in the world that they choose themselves .
so some of the technological change , even more clearly , because the fact that there was a different truth , because every human human society can give a little bit of knowledge and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus .
so , the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people are always asking me to tell you how to tell me , and i &apos;m going to be very uncomfortable with that , and i felt very uncomfortable with feeling the questions of people to answer people , and i think , gradually , i understand why .
it &apos;s the idea of dealing with the idea of the idea that success or happiness is dependent on the idea of becoming a challenge , as if my life is so successful , as if my life would be so successful , because i could get the kinds of life to a prosthetic , or whatever people could see me with my disability .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing , of course , of course , of course , we &apos;re being shaped , whether it &apos;s physically , emotional or even both .
and i want to suggest that &apos;s good .
widrigkeiten are not an obstacle that we need to have to make in order to our lives .
widrigkeiten are just one of our lives .
and i tend to see widrigkeiten as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that it &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s very present sometimes , but he &apos;s all the time .
and i don &apos;t want to get the impact of the kampfs of a human being .
there are widrigkeiten and challenges , and these are just alllzu , and every person is different about it , but the question is not if we &apos;re clear to widrigkeiten or not , but how we get clear .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people we love to preserve , but they &apos;re also trying to get out of it .
and we don &apos;t have any like our kids if we &apos;re giving them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you &apos;ve got to separate two things : to be the medical fact , and to the other of the social opinion about whether i am disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and constant disability , which i had to put apart with me , the world is all the time , she can describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect people who are at the heart , and they &apos;re the cool , the hard truth about their medical forecast , or even a prediction to the quality of life that they expect , we have to be careful that we don &apos;t put them on the way that somebody is actually disabled .
maybe this is the concept of what it &apos;s in a broken concept , which is in a broken , and how we fix this , for each greater disability than the offices .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being , and not all of its forces , and not to recognize all its forces and possibilities and recognize , in addition to the natural struggle you may have to lead , another disease .
we degradieren a person who has value for our society .
so we &apos;ve got to look beyond the patologie and focus on all of the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between the perception of our unzulänglichkeiten and our great erfindergeist , a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t be able to abwerten these herausfordernden times or deny , we should not try to avoid them , we should be under the carpet , but it &apos;s about to see the most of the opportunities .
i may be more likely to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to get rid of widrigkeiten , but that we have to hug them for the hug , to put them on the schopf , and maybe even to dance .
and maybe we do it , widrigkeiten as anything natural , stimmiges and useful and useful , and feel like that &apos;s not the presence of their presence .
in this year , we celebrate 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , in a very true of the human character .
i would use it , not the most powerful of its species , and also not the intelligenteste of its way , but that changes change changes .
from conflicts comes creativity is creativity .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people to survive and aufzublühen , from the fight of the human mind is determined to turn through conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest capabilities of people .
and maybe we know what wood we &apos;re cut from wood if we really get tested .
it may be exactly the point of widrigkeiten , a perception of ichs , a sense of our own force .
we can give ourselves something like that .
we can give widrigkeiten a new meaning that over severe times .
maybe we can see widrigkeiten as a change .
widrigkeiten are for a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to have adapted to .
i think the biggest damage that we &apos;ve done to ourselves is believe that we should be normal .
let &apos;s say , who is normal ?
there is no normal .
there &apos;s the common thing . but not the normal . but not the normal , and you know , you know , you know , the poor person who really want to know if they really would be ?
i think it doesn &apos;t .
it would be great if we could even have this paradigm of normal , or the strength or strength to make it even a bit more dangerous , which is that we can release the forces of very many kids , and invite them to bring their very special and valuable skills into society .
anthropolgen found that we &apos;ve always got people from the members of our society : useful to be useful to be useful .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals has been giving up 60,000 years ago , and it may have evidence for 60,000 years ago , and it might have been , because the lebenserfahrung in the überlebenskampf of these people , for society .
they didn &apos;t have those people as broken and useless ; they were very special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went in the city where i grew up in a lebensmittelmarkt in the northeast of pennsylvania in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there in front of a scheffel tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had shorts .
and i hear , like a guy behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around , and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you may barely remember me .
when i first saw her , i pulled her out of the belly of her mother . &quot;
oh , so .
and of course , it &apos;s made it click .
this was dr. kean , a man that i just knew from narratives of my mother about this day because i , of course , is very typical of my birthday to my birthday two weeks .
the doctor &apos;s physician for pränatale diagnostik was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without wadenbeine , and my feet , and my feet , and i had just been looking at this , and some toes toes on the other foot , he was the überbringer , these strangers had to be the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never be as beweglich as other children or you could never have an independent life , and then you just lie in gestraft . &quot;
i found that he had collected my entire childhood zeitungsausschnitte in my entire childhood , whether i had collected in a buchstabier-wettbewerb in the second , whether i had collected my scholarship scholarship or one of my sportlichen , and he used these clips clips , and he used these clips to teach his students , medizin-studenten from the hahnemann medical medical school and the hershey medical school .
and he called this part of his kurses the x factor , the potential of the human will .
you can just not emphasize enough to emphasize the quality of life of a human life .
and dr. kean said , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they haven &apos;t all the time , and even if they get a little bit of support , if you get children , you can do a lot of kids . &quot;
see , dr. kean changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone manage to deal with two different things .
and i &apos;ve changed my thinking in the course , if you were at age me at the age of 15 years , if i had asked my prostheses from flesh and bones , i wouldn &apos;t have a second .
i really wanted to work normal at the time .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not sure .
and that &apos;s what happens because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not in spite of that experience .
and maybe that transformation could happen , because i &apos;ve met so many people who opened doors to my doors , instead of people who me , or i wanted to have an idea .
you see , you know , it really needs a person who shows you how they can manifestieren their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate your own inner inner forces -- the human mind is so empfangsbereit -- if you can do that , and for somebody in a critical moment , you open up a door , you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
they bring them to open doors .
the importance of the worts &quot; is ultimately wurzelt in the word &quot; educe . &quot;
it means something that is in one of the ways to create the potential .
again , what kind of potential do we want to do ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the &apos; 60s , in britain , in the u.k. became umgewandelt in gesamtschulen .
they call this &quot; streaming trials &quot; in the united states we call this as &quot; tracking . &quot;
the students are divided to notes .
and a student a student will be mündlich harder , get better teachers .
they then have given a dreimonatigen period of time with a &quot; enough , &quot; the grade note , &quot; very well . they told them , they were asse that they were very clever , and after those three months , they were really einser .
and of course , it breaks to hear a heart that the other way the einser-schülern was said , they just be enough .
and then it was like the three months .
but only those that still were in school -- except from the students who had thrown out school .
the key thing about this study was that the teachers were not eingeweiht .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were just told that they were the einser-schüler , and that they are the students with the grade enough , and they &apos;ve been treated with them .
the only real real real thing is a gebrochener mind that was broken no hope , has no more hope . he finds nothing more schön. to him , our natural , kindliche , and our angeborene ability of imagination .
but if we can do it to support the human mind , trying to continue to , and to others and other people to find beautiful , curious and phantasievoll , then we &apos;re going to make our forces really positive .
if a mind has about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new daseinsformen .
i &apos;d written with a poem called hafiz poet called hafiz on the 14th poet , and the poem is called &quot; the god , &quot; not the god , not the god of the verbote , but the god who knows only four words , and those all the time , he always says , come , dance with me . &quot;
come , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would they be better than they &apos;re currently ?
suppose i said , by a few changes of their genes , a better memory could have -- more precise , closer and faster .
or if you want to have fitter , you have more power .
do you want to be more attractive and more attractive ?
how would it be to live longer with good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who are always sehnten for more creativity .
what would you like most ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
there &apos;s a few . probably about as many people here are creative people .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would choose to choose a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
some less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i love to be a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is it all einbildung ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been a andauerndes issue here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the idea of a doctor .
the great geneticists in the 20th century , t.g. dobzhansky , who was also a kommunikant in the russian orthodoxen church once had a essay , once called &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense of evolution . &quot;
well , if you &apos;re one of those that accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good time to get rid of your personal kommunikationsgerät -- i give you permission -- and maybe you can see a look at kathryn &apos;s book , which is about being wrong , because there &apos;s nothing in the other course of this talk to make any sense for you .
but if you accept biological evolution , what you think about : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other geltend or does it matter ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this image , i have a bush as a center of the verzweigungen in all directions , because if you look at the edges of life , all the existing spezien on the spitzen of these branches have had survived in evolutionary terms : they survived ; it has fitness , fitness and strength .
and the human part of this busches , far at the end , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
we are zweigen by a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in that period , there were maybe 20 or 25 different spezien of hominids .
some of them have come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130.000 years .
it seems like we were quite remote from the other parts of life the tree of life , but in fact , in the most part , the basic mechanisms are pretty much as our cells .
is you clear that we can make it , and the mechanisms of a bacterium , to produce the protein of the human being , which is used to treat diabetiker diabetiker ?
this is not like humaninsulin ; this is the same protein that is chemically ununterscheidbar from what comes from the pancreas .
and we &apos;re talking about bacteria , is we realize that each of us in our gut are more bacteria than it leads to cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , do you think if antonio antonio damasio is asking your self , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful gastfreundlichen environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s feucht , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re all going to nutrients that you could just wish without effort .
it &apos;s really a lighter way to make bacteria , with gelegentlichen unterbrechungen of unintended , jeodch push to the outcome .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they are important for their life .
they help the essentiellen nutrients . and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionäres balance in the form of a species ?
or are we determined to become something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
let &apos;s take a step back to the time of the big bang , 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago , maybe three to four billion years ago -- the first mehr-zelligen organisms -- the first mehr-zelligen organisms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years -- and then the human species that have changed in the last 130.000 years .
in this huge unvollendeten symphony of the universe , life on earth is only very much higher ; the animal kingdom , like a single one , and the human life , a little notenverzierung .
we were .
this also represents the unterhaltungswert of this talk , so i hope , d ate it .
now , when i was a neuling on college , i had my first biologiekurse .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with evolution , and i found something very basic : in most of the life of life in einzelligen organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to continue into both tochterzellen .
but at the time , as a mehrzelligen organisms , the things started changing .
sexual reproduction comes into the picture .
and importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction that is about the genome , the rest of the body .
in fact , they could say that the unausweichlichkeit of death of our body in the same moment is what the sexual reproduction .
now , i said , if i was a college-student , i thought , i thought , well , sex / death , death of sex -- it seemed to be pretty reasonable at the time , but with every year , it has come to my increased .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , which in vegas was vorführte his show in vegas .
and one night , there &apos;s an pat on his hotelzimmertür .
he opens the door .
it &apos;s a beautiful spärlich showgirl .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super-sex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take soup . &quot;
i came to the realization as a doctor , as a doctor , as a doctor that i was different than the goal of evolution , not necessarily , just different .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to rebuild the health of health .
i wanted us to have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all over the sum of the genome to the next generation and survival generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they are , and i &apos;m like booster rockets send the genetic fracht to the next level of the orbit to fall into the sea .
and i think we would all have the mood the mood of all the way to understand , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve immortality through my work .
i want to do it by not going to die . &quot;
evolution does not necessarily mean to the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily reduce the biggest ones , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the best .
evolution priviligiert the creatures that adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , which are thermophil , and by using the hot steam , if fish were there , there would be a vacuum of fish , and yet they have a vacuum , yet they have a bewohnbare environment there .
so , what that means is if we look at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the place in evolution , and how we think of the people in evolution , and especially as we vorausschauen in the next stage , i would say there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reasons that we were in the first is that we &apos;ve done by medicine a lot of genes that were otherwise rausgewählt , and they would be made from the population .
and secondly , we as a species , we &apos;ve done our environment , that we &apos;ve been able to be able to adapt to us right , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and zirkulieren and mix so much that they can &apos;t tell longer that isolation is necessary for the evolution , for the evolution of evolution .
a second way is that it &apos;s going to be an evolution of traditional species , of course , auferlegt by the forces of nature .
and the argument , here is that the wheels of evolution would be slow slowly , but they &apos;re unerbittlich .
and so far the isolation is , if we cover planets as a species of distant planets , and the change of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third way , a verlockende , intriguing and scary possibility , and terrifying possibility .
i call it neo-evolution -- the new development that is not simply , of course , but led to us as individuen. in the decisions we do .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s think of the reality that people are making decisions about their offspring today .
they are , in some cultures , the choice , to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family choose .
so think if it &apos;s not only possible , if you can &apos;t only choose the gender of your child &apos;s body , you &apos;re also going to make your child genetische your child &apos;s body and prevent disease .
what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or to eliminate the risk of cancer or stroke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to want to make those changes in your genes ?
if we vorausblicken , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2,7 billion dollars .
this next year when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in drein to four months .
today , you can get a sequence of the three billion base of the human genome from about $ about $ 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take a long time to be reality , that it will be the 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will be increasingly available to everybody .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering engineering gave the national prize for francis arnold and willem stemmer , two scientists that evolved to develop the natural process of evolution the natural process of evolution , to work faster and work faster , in a more efficient way -- which is called the frances arnold &quot; direct evolution . &quot;
a few years ago , the lasker-preis of the scientists in which he took an adult hautzelle for his research , he took an adult hautzelle , and through the manipulation of only four genes , the cell together to turn them to a pluripotenten stem cell -- a cell is potentially able to get any cell in your body .
these changes are inside .
the same technology that makes the human insulin in bacteria produces viruses that can &apos;t only protect the protection , but also , to the immunity against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study at a vaccine that has a vaccine that has been grown in the cells of a tabakpflanze .
can you imagine a little good thing that tabak ?
this is all of the reality , and in the future will be much more possible .
then just imagine two different changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if you could change the spermien and eizellen or the fresh befruchtete egg , could change your kids a better chance for a gesünderes life -- eliminating diabetes , remove the hämophilie , the risk of the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want a healthier kids ?
and then the analytical technology , the same motor of science that can allow change changes to prevent disease , could also allow us to adopt super-attribute , hyper-kapazitäten -- better memory .
why don &apos;t have the schlagfertigkeit of a ken jennings , especially if you can expand it with the next generation of watson-maschine ?
why don &apos;t we have the fast muskelfasern that will allow you to walk faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
this will be unwiderstehlich .
and if we &apos;re at a place that we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we will be transformed by alt-stil evolution to neo-evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that needs a process that requires 100,000 years , and we can do it for a thousand years -- and maybe in the next 100 years .
these are decisions with which their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to be .
do we use these decisions to form a society that is better , the more successful is more friendly ?
or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to form a society , and uniformierter , or more robust and vielseitiger ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to meet .
and most of all , are we going to ever be able to develop the wisdom of the wisdom , and the wisdom of the wisdom that we need to make these decisions ?
in good ways , in the good way , and as you might think , these decisions are going to us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine a little bit , a portable robot that gives you a übermenschliche robot , or another , that helps you to stand up and walk up again .
we at berkeley bionics called these robots exoskelette .
they &apos;re not different than something that they put in the morning and give them extra strength , and that &apos;s going to increase their speed and help them to keep their balance .
this is actually the true of human and machine .
but not only that -- in this and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
this is not just a crazy idea .
so to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start to talk about the american soldiers who &apos;s wearing average about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the demand that they should wear more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- rückenverletzungen , 30 percent of it -- chronic rückenverletzungen .
so we thought we would embrace this challenge , and create a exoskelett that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you now -- or the human natural load .
soldier : with the hulc-exoskelett , i can carry 200 pounds across verschiedenartiges terrain , many hours long .
so flexible design enables it to allow itself deep to kriechen , to kriechen and highly wendige movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then my strength and resilience .
we &apos;re as far as we can imagine our industriepartner this device , this new exoskelett in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s take our look at the rollstuhlfahrer , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people in the world estimated in a wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually an conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about a very young person with spinal cord rückenmarksverletzungen that in the blütezeit of their life -- &apos; 20s , &apos; 20s , &apos; 20s , &apos; 50s -- and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , their number .
and pretty much the only option -- when it comes to a hirnschlag , or other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and this is what it &apos;s been for 500 years , by the way , as i have to say , is very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chapter in terms of mobility .
so let me show you a elegs that at 19 years ago , the rückenmarksverletzung suffered by 19 years ago , that she was not able to run out for 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our elegs .
it has sensors .
its completely non-invasiven sensors in the crutches , the signals zurücksenden on our back on our back here on their back .
here &apos;s also batteriepackungen , the motorantrieb is on their hips , as well as their kniegelenken , which they move forward to this pretty much geschmeidigen and very natural gear .
i was 24 years old , and in bestform , as a monströser purzelbaum while a skiabfahrt skiabfahrt .
every fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement of my beckens .
not long after that , a doctor in my krankenzimmer and he said , &quot; amanda , you will never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he er hope of the hope of my consciousness .
anpassungsfähige technologies have been ermöglich to learn to go back to drive again , to go back and go back to the hands .
but nothing was invented that would leave me again , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or amanda , or amanda amanda , but for everybody .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m a head of the entwicklungsabteilung organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t bekämpfe poverty , i bekämpfe as a gehilfe in a volunteer löschzug on a volunteer .
now , in our city , in which you have a hochqualifizierte berufsfeuerwehr , you have to be quite early at the brandstelle to be able to mitmischen .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteers volunteers in the brandstelle , so i had pretty good opportunities to go in .
but it was still a run against the other volunteers to reach the verantwortlichen and figure out what our tasks would be .
and when i found the hauptmann , he just had a very serious conversation with the hausbesitzerin that certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was in the middle of the night , and she was in the schlafanzug , and she stood out in the strömenden , while her house in fire .
the other volunteers who got close to me -- let &apos;s call it lex luther -- reached the hauptmann as first , and was asked to go to the house and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was sprachlos .
there was some lawyer or vermögensverwalter , which is now for the rest of his life that he was able to tell people that he was in a brennendes house , just because it was five seconds faster than me .
well , i was the next .
the hauptmann winkte me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go into the house .
you have to go up with the fire , over , and you have to get this woman a few shoes . &quot;
i swear .
now , not exactly what i hope to do , but i went out -- the stairs , the hallway , the hallway , on the &quot; real , &quot; the &quot; real &quot; in the real feuerwehrmännern , &quot; the &quot; the &quot; real &quot; the &quot; real &quot; , that at that time was pretty much done to get into the bedroom to get a few shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i had my prey back down , where i was on the front door and met my erzfeind dog .
we put our value out to the hausbesitzerin outside , where , not surprisingly , he got a lot more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the feuerwache got a letter a letter , in which she was going to take care of your house in saving your house .
and one of all of the maßen kindness : someone had brought them a couple of shoes .
both in my job at robin hood , as a volunteer fireman , i &apos;m looking at the witness of generosity and kindness in the great scale , but i also see the love and the muts of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look at this room in this room , and you see , you know , you know , or on your way there , i want to offer memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the life of another , until they &apos;ve reached their first million .
if you have something to give , you &apos;ll give it .
if you have a suppenküche , you put a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us a chance to save the lives of a person , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one .
so they go ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just going to come back from a community that knows the secret of humanity &apos;s secret .
a place where women can lead the zepter to sex with sex , say , and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not burning or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their verwandtschaft .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the urwald in congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees in the next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived around six million years ago .
now chimps , chimpanzees are known for their aggressivität .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of überbetont in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
so , as a large , fear of great , fear of being led to the bonobo-gesellschaft of ermächtigten females .
they really have come up with what &apos;s made up , because that leads to a ausgesprochen society that has never been seen in the deadly violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known below primates primates .
they live in the deep depths of the kongolesischen , and the observation is only hard to access .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness -- the arena of a violent struggle that has been wütet for decades and almost as many lives as the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprised that this destruction is the survival of the bonobos .
fleischhandel and the decline of the baumbestandes lead that you can &apos;t even have a stadion with the verbliebenen bonobos -- and even there we are not safe to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a verborgenes laugh for the trees .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have häufigen , auch sex , with wechselnden partners , and the rules and social angelenheiten .
i &apos;m not saying that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because the bonobos of the bonobos is more than the kama sutra .
bonobos -- like humans -- love playing their lives long .
play is not just kinderspiele .
for us , and it &apos;s a fundamental game for the attachment of relationships and the care of tolerance .
this is what we &apos;re learning and the rules of the game .
play is increasing creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of interactions , diversity of connections .
and if you watch bonobos in play , you see the evolutionary origins of human lachens , dance and of rituals rituals .
play is the kitt that beieinanderhält us .
now , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique images from the wild .
first of all , a ballspiel on bonobo-art -- and i don &apos;t think about fussball .
so here we see a young female and males in a verfolgungsspiel .
look at what she does .
this may be the evolutionary origin of this : &quot; she puts it up to eggs . &quot;
only i think it rather like it , not true .
yes !
so , sexspiele are common , both with bonobos as well .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ideenreichtum that you put new elements in the game -- like the testicles -- and also , like the testicles both trust as well -- while it &apos;s a lot of fun .
but the game is a formwandler .
play is a formwandler , and it can take a lot of forms that some of them are quiet , phantasievoll , curious -- maybe to discover the surprise again .
and i want to show you , this is fuku , a young female , and they &apos;re playing with water peaceful .
i think just like you &apos;re playing sometimes , and we &apos;re loten limitations of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore and interact , and the unexpected brains that we form is the real nährboden of creativity .
this is just a little vorgeschmack on the insights , bonobos gewähren us in our past and present .
but they also have a secret to our future , a future where we need to adapt to increasing challenges through greater creativity and druch cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our anpassungsjoker .
to adapt to a unbeständige world , we need to play .
but are we going to do the best from our spieltrieb ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people equally , life are not in teeth and claws alone .
now , if it hardly seems to be appropriate , maybe the nötigsten .
and so , my primatenkameraden , let &apos;s give us this gift of evolution , and in common , as we have the creativity about creativity and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples , in the middle of 1979 , exactly the same day , at exactly the same time , every zeugt , a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , every zeugt a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to use a lot of time , because if you imagine the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me all the time .
just imagine that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case , there is a y chomosom chomosom , which hits the x chromosome of the eizelle .
and in the other case , there &apos;s an x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the eizelle .
both of them are überlebensfähig , both light .
we &apos;ll go back to these people later .
most of my activities , i have two hüte .
and under a hat , i &apos;m involved with the story of anatomy .
i &apos;ve studied historikerin , and in this case , i study how people with anatomy -- the human body , animal body bodies -- like them with körperflüssigkeiten umgingen , with körperkonzepten , how they thought about bodies .
the other hat i carried to do with my work is the activist , as an patientinnenanwältin -- or , as i sometimes say , as an ungeduldige lawyer -- from people who are patients .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have körpertypen , the social norms .
so , for example , i &apos;ve been working with people who are twins , and two people in a body .
i &apos;ve worked with people with zwergenwuchs -- so people who were smaller than common .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with intersexuellen people whose gender is atypisch -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female körpertypen .
and as a general term , we can use the word intersexualität .
intersexualität comes in many different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you some examples of examples of the kinds of geschlechtsvarianten , which is not equal to the male or female .
in one case , you might have somebody with a xy chromosomenbasis , and the sry gene of the y chomosoms leaves the protogonaden that we all have , we grow up .
and that &apos;s why the testicles are going on in fötalen testosterone .
but because that individual are missing the receptors to see the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called androgenrezeptor-defekt .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body is more of the typical female female course .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . it &apos;s being brought as a girl .
but it &apos;s mostly until they reached puberty and their breasts grow and develop their breasts , but they &apos;re not going to get their period , until someone is going to get something different .
and they &apos;re going to make some tests and find out of the tests , instead of the tests , in fact , in reality , in fact , is hoden , and they have a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold this person , but they &apos;re not really .
women , as men , have something called adrenalindrüsen .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the nebennieren stellen are androgene that are hormones .
most women , as i -- i think i don &apos;t have my real chromosomenaufbau -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromosomenaufbau , but i think i &apos;ve probably got the typical -- most women like me are actually talking to androgene .
we produce androgen , and we &apos;re talking to androgene .
the result is someone like me actually have a brain that was exposed to more androgenen than a woman who was born with testicles and a androgenrezeptor-defekt .
so gender is really complicated ; intersexuelle are not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some ways , you can be distributed across the entire range .
one example , a few years ago , i received the call , a few years ago , who was born as a boy , he had sex with his girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived with his husband , and he had just found that he had eierstöcke and a gebärmutter .
he had an enormous form of an angeborenen nebennierenrindenhyperblasie .
he &apos;s got xx chromosome , and in the womb , his nebennieren were so strong that they &apos;ve made a male hormonumgebung .
and as a result , his genitalien männlich , his brain , his brain was exposed to the typischeren male part of the hormonenspektrums .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody saw something .
and only when he became 19 , he got enough medical problems , in fact , in fact , because he was in the inside that the doctors found that he was inside the female female .
okay , just a quick example of a version of intersexualität .
some people with xx chromosomes , develop something that is called ovotestis , with eierstockgewebe umhüllt .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason kids with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s zwergenwuchs or siamesische twins , be intersexuell -- from surgeons often being adapted to the norm , is not because that was for their physical health health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they &apos;re often made different kinds of surgical treatments is because they threaten our social categories .
our system is based on the idea of the idea that we have a certain anatomische scale with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is to have a woman to have a female identity ; a black person to be a black person is meant to have an african anatomy , in terms of our history .
so we have this terribly vereinfachende idea .
and if we faced with a body that &apos;s actually something very different , which is really confused us in terms of this .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualismus .
and our nation is based on a very romantic concept of individualismus .
now you can imagine how amazing it is , when kids are born that are two people in a body .
where i &apos;ve heard the most excited about the most excited , the südafrikanische läuferin semenya semenya semenya semenya , whose gender was weltmeisterschaft in a question .
a lot of journalists were calling me on the question : &quot; what are you going to do that tell us whether caster caster &apos;s female or a male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalist that there &apos;s a test .
now we know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not going to be between the male and female , or between männlich and intersexuell and intersexuell and intersexuell ; tastächlich , we are that line as of course , as of course .
so we have a situation where we have to say that we have to say , where we have to admit that those categories categories that we have held for stable robust categories categories that are very simple zuordnungen zuordnungen to create permanent identitätskategorien , much more unschärfer than we thought .
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also true about race , which turns out as much more complicated than it turns out .
in our betrachtungen , in all kinds of unbequemen areas .
we push into the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what should we start with the fact that we &apos;re only different from them through a few ?
as we move forward our science , we get increasingly in a zone of the unbehagens where we need to recognize that the simplistischen categories categories we had probably had too simple .
we see this in all kinds of areas of human life .
one of the areas that we see in this is in our modern culture today , in which today &apos;s united states , are the fighting of the beginning and the end of life .
we have a difficult conversation about what a body gets to people , so he will have a different right now than fötale life .
we have a very difficult conversation today -- perhaps not as public as medicine -- about the question of when someone is dead .
our ancestors used to fight the question , when someone was dead .
you have somebody else to be a feather under the nose , and if she moved , they haven &apos;t buried it .
if she moved no longer , you buried them .
but today we are in a situation where we &apos;re going to take menschen organs and want to put them in other people .
and as a result , we get on the fight with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation that we don &apos;t have as simple as simple categories as it used to .
now you would think that the whole crash of categories of categories would actually make me happy .
i &apos;m political progressiv , i verteidige people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to realize that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , makes me angespannt .
and it makes me angespannt in terms of thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this anspannung , i first have to take a bekennen , i &apos;m a big fan of founding fathers .
i know they were rassisiten , i know they were sexisten , but they were great .
i think they were so tapfer and strong , and so radical , in which they did , i &apos;m going to look at the schmalzige musical 1776 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happened to the gründungsvätern .
the founding fathers were from my view of the original anatomischen activists , that &apos;s why .
what she was doing was a anatomisches concept , and they ersetzten it through another , which was radically and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
and as you all remember , our fathers lehnten the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was on a very vereinfachten concept in a very vereinfachten concept of anatomy .
the herrscher of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept based on dna , but they had to have a concept .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people , the political power , had to have the political power , because of the vererbten blutlinie from the grandfather to the son and so on .
the founding founding fathers came back up with this idea , and they replace them through a new anatomisches concept , and this concept said that all the people were created on the same way .
they nivellierten the field of play , and decided that anatomisch that anatomisch , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now , they made this part because they were part of a aufklärerischen system in which two things in common .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , the science grew up .
if you look at the story of the founding fathers , you know , many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistischen world .
and they went away from explanations explanations , übernatürlicher things like a supernatural concept of power , back , where the transmission are based on a very vagen act of geburtsrecht .
they moved to a naturalistischen concept .
and if you look at the independence of independence , they talk about nature and god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it made us a concept of anatomischen common .
and this is really what they prepared for the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did was great .
so what happened after years ?
for example , , for example , for example , they used to be more important than that , for example , is that it &apos;s more important than the anatomische , the idea of the founding fathers , which is that , for example , that we don &apos;t have , is that we don &apos;t have to have the wahlrecht , that we should not have the wahlrecht that we should have , the right thing , etc , etc .
and women argumentierten .
next , the successful civil rights movement , where we were looking at people like sojourner truth , who spach about , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the marschierenden rows of the bürgerechtsbewegung who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people more different color , in terms of anatomische differences , again , successful .
we see the same thing in behindertenrechtsbewegung .
of course , the problem is that , and we start looking at all the common , we need to be able to ask why we need to ask why we maintain certain .
well mind , mind , i &apos;d like to maintain certain trennungen , anatomisch , in our culture .
i don &apos;t want to give you the same rights as a person .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that 5-jährige should be the right to einverständnis their informed consent or to get married .
so there are some anatomische trennungen that make sense to me , and that we should , i think .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is , and why we keep them , and whether they make sense .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that have been gezeugt at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in the middle of 1979 , the same day .
so let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months , she was born on one of june one of june 1 .
heinrich , on the other side , is born to the geburtstermin , so he was born on one march 1980 .
just because mary fact that maria were born three months , they won all kinds of the rights three months before heinrich -- the rather einvernehmlichen sex , the right to have the right thing to drink .
heinrich has to wait for all of these , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the zeitpunktes of his birth .
we find other merkwürdigkeiten about what their rights are .
heinrich , because you think he &apos;s male -- even though i didn &apos;t tell you that with xy -- because you accept that it &apos;s male , it can now come in , which maria don &apos;t have to worry about .
whereas maria , on all states , there can &apos;t have the same thing to see the same , the heinrich in all states , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
heinrich can marry a woman , but maria can only be a woman in a woman today .
so we have these dauerhaften kategorien categories that are problematic in many ways and questionable questionable .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do this , because our science is that we do such progress in the anatomy , that we have to say that a democracy that is based on anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but sometimes it feels like science is on its own power .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture would take a kind of pragmatic attitudes , &quot; well , we need to go somewhere somewhere , so we move it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught up in a very strange position .
so , for instance , for example , texas , at a point that they decided to marry a man means that you don &apos;t have a y chromosome and marry a woman , means that you have a y .
now in practice , people don &apos;t test their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i &apos;ve told you about the androgenrezeptor-defekt .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream , &quot; a kind of solution .
he says we should not tell people to judge people , but after the property of their character , &quot; and go beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you look at people because of their charaktereigenschaften ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribute the rights in terms of people , because i have to admit that i know a series of golden retriever who are probably more likely than some people i know .
i want to suggest that i &apos;m probably going to know some bright labradorhunde who are fundiertere , you know , you know , and more sophisticated decisions about sexual relationships than some 40-jährige that i know .
so how are we going to be the question of the properties of character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and part of me ask , what if the content of a personality was something that would be maschinenlesbar in the future , could be made visible ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is a leader to make thinking about the questions of democracy .
in our effort for democracy , we &apos;ve done our things really well , and i think we would do our thing in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like this is the case , for example , where a man who is drawn to other men , and death with death , because it &apos;s ready to put a geschlechtsumwandlung in which he can remain alive .
we don &apos;t exist in that way .
i &apos;m happy to say that we can &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon i talked about a few years ago , who had a few siamesische twins twins in order to separate them , partly to make themselves a name .
but when i was telefonierte with him , and he asked him , and he asked him , and he asked him why he made these interventions -- was his answer to his country , that kids would be treated very badly , and so he had to do it .
and i said , &quot; well , did she look at policy in account rather than an operation to separate them ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible ways to allow people to be that they &apos;re going to change the state of the will .
that &apos;s why i think we have to be leaders .
well , just to finish up , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about dads .
and i want to think about how democracy might look like democracy , or looked like if we had the mothers involved .
and i want to say something that is radical for a feminist , and i think there might be different ways to be able to be able to apply different kinds of the anatomy of the anatomy of these anatomy , when people are using a gruppendenken .
since years , i &apos;ve been interested in intersexualität , i &apos;m also interested in the realm of geschlechterdifferenz .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from kulturübergreifenden studies is that women , on average -- not everybody , but on average -- rather , complex social social relationships and the care of people who are vulnerable within the group of vulnerable to give a lot of attention .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
and when i took a graduate student , one of my favorite students who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked at as a feminist , so it still -- a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism female female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism , that feminism stereotypes about gender , so that is why feminism is not female .
but the more i thought about his question , so much more i thought there could be some weibliches in feminism .
that is to say , there might be an average of the average , on average , where female brains tell us about hochkomplexe social relationships , and aufmerksamer social relationships .
so where the founding fathers were bedacht to figure out how individuals could be protected the state , it &apos;s possible that if we &apos;re more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re more like a concept of bekämmen , not just how to protect , but how we can do it for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s what we need to go to the future when we have to get democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual bodies to think about the individual bodies and thinking more about relationships .
so , when we try to make a human connection , we &apos;re thinking about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in this , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and this is : i &apos;m obsessed with outfits .
i love to find another opportunity to be able to find a different kind of thing , and just to photograph and photograph and bloggen .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of second hand in flohmärkten .
thank you .
second-hand-shopping allows me to reduce the impact of my garderobe on the environment and also my purse .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars are usually a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it &apos;s making a lot of personal schatzsuche .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers , i feel like i &apos;ve won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i &apos;ve been photographing for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does anyone do with so many outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i &apos;ve brought .
i brought seven unterhosen , and that &apos;s all .
unterhosen for a week is all i did in my suitcase .
i have bet that i wanted to wear everything i might have to wear , if i &apos;d come to palm springs .
and since you &apos;re not heard of me , as the woman who &apos;s sitting here at ted in your underwear , i &apos;ve found a few things .
and i just want to show you my outfits for this week .
sounds that good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to give you some of the lessons that i believe , if you believe it or not to carry out of these abenteuern , to wear nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the electromagnetic tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always be great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole thing , including , including me , and it was the most expensive piece , that i carried up in this whole week .
monday : color is powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiologisch impossible to be bad gelaunt if you put hellrote pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you get other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation is going to be totally überbewertet .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my life to try to be , i &apos;m going to be myself , and in the same time .
just be who you are .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , you won &apos;t just understand it , you &apos;ll value it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people tell me , i looked like , &apos; games or i don &apos;t remember them .
i &apos;d like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is key .
if you think you &apos;re going to look good , it &apos;s pretty safe .
and if you think you don &apos;t look good at something , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that briefly for you .
if you believe that you &apos;re inside and the outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to do everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden pailleten fit everything .
and finally , saturday : one of your own , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world something about one word without having a word .
it was always been proven to me and over again , when they were in this week , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
it &apos;s obviously not going to fit into my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to do it all again .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn from myself is that week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to emotionally anhaften , because the corner is going to be a different kind of crazy , farbenfrohes , strahlendes outfit that just wait for me when i love a little bit in the heart , and looking for it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i have something i want to show you .
think of this as a bildpunkt bildpunkt .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , wahrnehmbares design .
let me tell you a little bit about this .
so if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy is growing up with this picture in italy in italy , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this , in the formula one in the past decades , something very interesting happened .
a while ago , if you wanted to win a formula , they took their budget , and they put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
so today , if you want to win a race , in fact , if you want to win a race , a thousand thousand sensors , which is that information from the car , the information from the car , and then you use this information , and then you use them to use these car to make things in real time , and things can change things in real time .
you would call this in ingenieurteams , in ingenieurteams .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made out of two parts -- a spürenden part and a reagierendenteil .
now , what &apos;s interesting today is the echtzeit-kontrollsysteme is starting to come up in our lives .
our cities have been equipped in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to be with computers .
and as computers in free , they start reacting to other ways , and they &apos;re being experienced and driven .
if we herrichten cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population live there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energiekonsums -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
beyond cities , all of this view and drive the objects into objects of everyday life .
this is by an exhibition that paola antonelli for moma later , in the year , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; with me . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to go back to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if any atom is out there to both a sensor and a sensor .
and that changes radically the interaction that we have people with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo michelangelo ...
you know , as a michelangelo shaped the moses is that he took the hammer , and he took him -- actually , you can still see a little bit of untendrunter -- and she said , &quot; perché non parli ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
now , today , our environment begins for the very first time .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with this .
now the first project i &apos;d like to introduce you is one of the first of our labs .
it was born in italy four and a half years ago .
and what we did , actually , was to use a new kind of network of network that has been used in the world -- this is a mobiltelefonnetz -- that &apos;s a mobiltelefonnetz -- and open information out of this network that are being collected by the operators to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was the fußball-weltmeisterschaft .
some of you will remember , it was played in italy versus france , and then at the end of the zidane , the kopfstoß .
and no matter , italy at the end .
now , look at what happened that day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the middle of the kolosseum , the fluß tiber .
in the morning , the game .
you see the zeitachse .
early afternoon , people here and there , they &apos;re making calls and move .
the game starts -- silence .
france makes a gate . italy makes a gate .
halbzeit , people do a quick call , go to toilet .
second halbzeit . the end of the normal play .
first commons , second , second .
zidane , in a moment of kopfstoß .
italy wins . yeah .
now , in this night , everybody went to celebrate .
they saw the big key .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the siegerteam and the prime minister the prime time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the picture of the place circo , where , since the roman time , people who go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the key to the end of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t see a few years ago .
so quickly , a different example , you know , this is not about people , it &apos;s about people we use and consume .
now , today , we know all about where our things come from .
this is a map that gives you all the chips that a mac a mac computer is how they came together .
but we just know a little bit about where things go .
so , in this project , we actually designed some little markers to pursue the trash through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that were helped us to tag a little more than a year in seattle , the things that they have helped markieren -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that you might just throw away .
then we have the little chips , the little brands , the little brands , and put it on the waste .
here &apos;s the results that we &apos;ve just got .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with that information we realized that there &apos;s a lot of ineffizienzen in the system .
we can do the same things that we do with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this is a lot of unnützer transporte and complicated things .
the other thing is that we believe that if we see that we see that , if we see every day that we throw away , the cup that we just throw away , it &apos;s still on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw away every day .
and if we were to show that people , then we can push behavior change .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could give you a lot more about this and a lot of the other wonderful things that you can do with vision , but i want to talk to the second part that we &apos;ve been talking about in the beginning , and that &apos;s the betätigung of our environment .
and the first project is something that we made a few years ago in zaragoza , spain .
it started with a question of bürgermeisters , which came to us and said that spain and südeuropa have a beautiful tradition to use water as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology ?
and one of the ideas that were going on in a arbeitskreis ermittelt was , imagine these tubes , and the valves , magnetventile , work that open and close .
they do something like a wasservorhang with bildpunkten in water .
if those bildpunkte fall down , you can write , you can write patterns , images , text .
and they can approach it , and he &apos;s going to open up , and he will open up to let you see how you can see in this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor to the mayor .
it really liked him .
and we got the mission to design a building in the entrance of the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was water .
there are no doors or windows , but if you &apos;re approaching it , it will open and leave it .
the roof was covered with water .
and if it &apos;s windig , if you want to reduce the spritzen , you can even let the roof down .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture is going to be , and the whole architecture , you know , you know , this days , you get the roof , you get the images of people who were there and say , &quot; they destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t break the building , it &apos;s just that architecture is almost disappears .
here you see how the building works .
you see the person who asks what happens inside .
and here you see me when i was trying to test the sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what was happening at night when all the sensors stopped working .
but actually , it was a little greater fun in this night .
all the children from zaragoza came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to take them , but a building that &apos;s still breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump without getting wet .
and that was , very exciting for us , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we think about how people are using the things that we do .
but reality is unexpected .
and this is the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with people .
so here is a picture of the building with the physical bildpunkten , the bildpunkten of water and the projections .
and this is what made us think about the following project that i &apos;m showing you now .
so , if you could actually start to fly .
imagine you could have little helicopter , you could have little helicopters that fly through the air , and each of you with a little bildpunkt of light with light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the room .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the ones you saw earlier , which is completely moving in with others .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexiblen screen or an ad , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or , in three dimensions dimensions , where what &apos;s changing , the light is not the position of the bildpunkte .
you can play with different species .
imagine that it could just appear in different formaten or sizes , in different auflösungen .
but then it could just be a 3d cloud of bildpunkten that you can walk up and move through them , and move through them that they can look at many , many directions .
so here you see a real flyfire-steuerung , the herabsinkt , to form a gleichmäßiges .
when you turn the light on , it looks like this . so , as we saw it before .
imagine that every one of people are being controlled .
it could have a single impulse that &apos;s going to have a impulse that comes from people , from the movements of people or something like that .
i want to show you something here .
we &apos;ve worked with roberto bolle , one of the best balletttänzer of our time -- the étoile theater theater in new york , and the scala in milan -- we &apos;ve taken its movements in 3d to use it as a momentum for the flyfire .
here you see roberto dancing .
on the left-hand side , you see the bildpunkte , the different eingefangenen sensations .
it &apos;s at the same time a echtzeit-3d-scan and a bewegungsaufnahme .
so you can relate to this movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we all have bildpunkte , you can play with it and you can play with color , and play with color .
we want to use that as a possible impulse for the flyfire .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is , again , imagine what we &apos;re looking back with the people with something and to change the environment -- almost something like we call it , wolkenbewegung , but with a cloud .
imagine that everybody can give a little donation for a bildpunkt .
i think that the remarkable thing that happened over the last few years , the last decades , is that we have changed by a physical world .
that &apos;s all digitalisiert , knowledge , you know , and it makes it accessible by the internet .
for the first time , for the first time -- and the campaign showed this -- we can have shown this -- we can move from the digital forces of the networks of the networks of the networks of the physical world .
that can be , in our case , we &apos;re using it to design and create a symbol .
this is something that &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , to ask us the challenges -- think about climate change or the co2 emissions -- how we can then change from the digital world .
so the idea is that , in fact , we &apos;re in the people who are doing things together , collective .
the cloud is again a cloud of bildpunkten , in the same way that a real cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of bildpunkten .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but with bildpunkten .
they can move in and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it at the bottom , the most important moments for olympia 2012 and more than the kind of connection to the community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky , and something on the top you can go on , like london &apos;s new berggipfel .
you can get inside .
and a kind of digital leuchtturm in the night -- but as a allerwichtigstes , a new kind of experience for everyone wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , the context is very important .
by my work , i try to express that people are separated by nature , and that everything is connected to each other .
the first time i was in antarctica 10 years ago , where i saw my first eisberge .
my awe .
my heart raste , so i was trying to believe what was standing in front of me .
the eisberge around me was almost 60 feet from the water , and i could just wonder that this was a lion in a different snowflake , year to year .
eisberge are born as a kalb of a glacier or by brechen .
every iceberg has his own individual personality .
they &apos;re interacting with their environment and their experiences .
some refuse to give up and klammern up to the bitteren , while , as others , and in a anfall much more dramatic passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you &apos;re easy to think that they &apos;re isolated , separated and alone , just as we see people often .
but the truth is far away .
and as a iceberg , i atme his vorzeitliche atmosphere .
during the iceberg , he &apos;s setzt drinking drinking water , which feeds a lot of life forms .
i &apos;m going to look at this eisberge , as i was going to make portraits of my ancestors , in the mind that they exist in these individual moments of this way , and never come again .
it &apos;s not a death when it melt ; it &apos;s not the end , it &apos;s a fortführung of your pfades along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the eisbergen that i photographiere is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so the last images i &apos;d like to show you is a iceberg that i have in kekertsuatsiak kekertsuatsiak in greenland .
very rarely , you can actually witness a rollenden iceberg iceberg iceberg .
this is what you see .
on the left , you see a little boat .
it &apos;s about five feet long .
please look at the form of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the wasserlinie .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a grönland-eisbergs .
it ragt about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just like this shows you the iceberg a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really blessed by working on some amazing projects .
but in the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was about this guy .
his name is tempt .
tempt was one of the leading graffitikünstler in the &apos; 80s .
then , one day , he came back and he said , &quot; paps , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of it .
tempt is completely paralyzed .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood across him .
i have a company that design design and animations , so that &apos;s also a complex part of what we admire in the world world and watch .
so , we decided , tony -- tempt -- and his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with that ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i &apos;ll just want to talk to tony again .
i just want to just him again and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all the paralyzed people communicate through these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard to higher gesellschaftsschicht and have a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
ordinary people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
did anyone see the movie and taucherglocke ?
that &apos;s how they communicate -- so they walk along their fingers .
i staunte : &quot; very archaisch , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came to the need with the need , just a check check , and instead i made a check check , i didn &apos;t have the smallest idea of how i was supposed to go .
and i verpflichtete on his brother and his father -- in the words , &quot; well , my proposal , &quot; well , my suggestion is , tony &apos;s going to talk to him a device , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can do his art again .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s still carrying it , it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i talked about a few months later at a conference .
i met these people of grl , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on each surface , and then put a laserpointer on this , which is that the negative space .
so they &apos;re moving around and make kunstinstallationen like this .
they say all the things that are shown up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the geschlechtsteilen , then the schimpfwörter , then the schimpfwörter , and finally , people are doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in her presentation .
so , i went home with my wife and i had dinner with my wife , with my wife , with my wife and i had dinner with my wife , which is where you can use your eyes to control things , then we should find a way that tempt can make a laser , so that would be awesome . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , a lot of organization and a lot , and forth , we &apos;ve done some things .
first , we have the insurance insurance for the doors , and actually have a device for tempt a device that he can communicate with -- a stephen hawking-maschine .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really very funny -- i call it yoda , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so unwürdig , this guy is incredible . &quot;
we also have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the edges of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children , and i pulled into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and verschwörungstheoretiker and anarchisten have taken our house .
a lot of our friends thought that we were beautiful to do that , and that we were zurückkämen and all the images on the walls were graffitis .
but for two weeks , we &apos;ve programmed , in venice , in venice , in venice , my children were involved , my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap sonnenbrille that we bought at the strandpromenade of venice , something kupferdraht and a few things from the hardware store and the elektronikhandel .
we took a ps3-kamera , they &apos;ve got a ps3-kamera , and now we have a device that &apos;s accessible to free -- you can build it ourselves , we provide the code free , we can download software for free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free of constraints .
no insurance can be insurance .
no hospital .
every paralyzed paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so , at the end of the two weeks , we went back in tempts .
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all this rummel in front of the great unveiling .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks , nudelparties and durchgemachten nights , tony drew the first time after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support , and it looks beyond his life support system .
we tend to geneigt his bed so it can see it outside .
we have a system set up against a wall of the hospital .
and he came back for the first time of his family &apos;s family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a sense of it was on the parking lot .
we also had to deal with the parking lot , we felt more than a part of the sprüher-szene .
at the end , he sent us an email with the following content : &quot; for the first time for seven years , i &apos;ve drawn something .
i feel that i was kept under water , and finally someone raised up and raised my head , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
this is something like our kampfschrei .
that &apos;s holding us on the shelf , and let &apos;s move forward .
and we need to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s an amazing device .
and somebody who has some such potential potential , deserves so much more .
so what we &apos;re doing is to figure out how to do it faster and stronger .
since that time , we have all kinds of recognition .
we won a couple of awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve .
it all comes from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong twitterte over us and then , in december , we have honored to be honored than one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
this is the coolste -- and this includes the whole circle -- that it &apos;s this april -- it &apos;s this april , in the middle of los angeles , in the middle of los angeles .
and there may be as much as the hardest representative of straßenkunstszene to be present -- banksy , shepard , shepard , caws -- all these guys are going to be there .
tempt will be part of the show , which is pretty wild .
so basically , if you see something that is impossible , then make it possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eyewriter -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- all of you here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never had anything to do with augenerfassungstechnologie , but i just got something , and i was surrounded with this amazing people , so we could put something on the legs .
and this question should each of you , and every day that you make something that you can do . if you can do something that you can do , if not , when it is ? and if not me , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s meist kinderbuchautor .
and i &apos;m always saying that i don &apos;t want to get to the people like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or leather , but nobody ever voted farmers .
today i &apos;d like to tell you about circles and offenbarungen .
well , an epiphany is usually something that you find , because you &apos;ve dropped it somewhere .
you go to the block , and you take it as revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends made it -- richard bollingbroke .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at high school in the &apos; 60s , ohio , where i was the klassenschwuchtel .
i was the one who was beaten every week in the jungentoilette green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by letting me use the toilet in the lehrerzimmer .
they did it .
she did three years .
and i had to go away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it proposed to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then in the 1980s , i found it really important to record a work at aids-organisationen .
about three or four years ago , i got a call from the night from this teacher , frau post , who said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other as adults .
can you please go to ohio , and please come together with the guy i know you &apos;ve found it .
and i should mention that i have bauspeicheldrüsenkrebs , and i want you to go . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we cried , we cried , and we knew that they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , and we took them , and we took care about them , and we gave them eight , because it needed to be necessary .
it was something we knew to do .
and as the woman who would know me as adults , i got to know , she turned into a box , and she was placed in my hands .
what happened is that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation of that i &apos;ve been talking about .
the revelation is , death is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this was so often mentioned here today .
it takes as much -- he would need , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s about giving these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion while you go up to 1,000 feet .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine a nuclear engine , das , klack , klack , klack , klack , klack power .
that sounds angst .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i was sitting on 1d .
i was the only one who was able to talk to the flugbegleitern .
so i looked at her , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve probably caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already been gewendet , and we weren &apos;t far away .
you can see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot richtete the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
he turns out the engines .
imagine a geräuschloses plane .
and then he said three words -- the emotionslosesten words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; bereitmachen to hit . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the bordpersonal .
i could see it in your eyes , there was upset , life was at the end .
i want to tell you three things that i &apos;ve learned about that day .
i learned that in a moment , everything else is different .
we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to do a hand , and it didn &apos;t do , all the fences i wanted to do , all the experiences i wanted to do , and never did .
while i was thinking about it later , i was a saying , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is as far and the person , then i open him .
i don &apos;t want to move more in life .
and that urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we verfehlten up the george washington , pretty much about haaresbreite -- i thought , human , there &apos;s one thing that i really bereue .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i &apos;m going to be able to get better in everything i anpackte .
but i &apos;ve also given my ego my ego in my ego .
and i bedauerte the time that i &apos;m doing for bedeutungslose things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife to friends , to people .
and then , when i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t get my wife to my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have that anymore ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing that i learned -- and as the inner clock beginnnt , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 .
you see the water .
i said , &quot; please flieg in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break into 20 parts , as you know it from a documentary .
as we abstürzen , i had this feeling , human beings , is not terrifying .
almost like this , we would prepare for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness really formierte in a mind , which is that i just wish for one thing .
i just wish i could see my children grow up .
about a month after that , i went to my daughter of my daughter -- erstklässler , nicht talent ...
... not yet .
and i &apos;m feiere , i &apos;m wine like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made sense for me .
i realized at the time by putting the dots the dots with each other that it &apos;s about a great father .
more than anything , everything else , is my only goal in life to be a good father .
i was the miracle more than not dying that day .
i received another gift , which i got to see in the future and come back and to live and live differently .
my call to all that fly today is : imagine the same thing happens on your flight -- you don &apos;t -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
what would they do that they &apos;re doing because they think they &apos;d be there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and your negative energy ?
and more than anything , are they the best parents that they can only be ?
thank you .
and the idea behind the stuxnet computer-wurm is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is the uran-anreicherungs-einrichtung in natanz .
the gray boxes you see here are echtzeit-kontrollsysteme .
now , if it &apos;s going to be able to control the systems and control the systems , then we can actually do a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes are not running with windows-software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do it is an effective institution on a laptop , which is used by a wartungsingenieur , to konfigurieren this gray box , we &apos;re in business .
and this is the planning of planning .
so we start with a windows-dropper .
the nutzdaten run into the gray box , the centrifuge , the centrifuge the centrifuge , and the iranian verzögert in verzögert .
this is a kinderspiel , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started putting our research back six months ago , it was completely unknown , which is the sense of purpose and purpose .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the windows- part of the windows- part of the dropper- part of , and he made by unzähligen zero- .
and it seemed vorzuhaben , with these gray boxes , that echtzeit- kontrollsystemen .
the erregte of our attention , and we started a labor- project where we were infected with stuxnet environment , and studying this .
and then something weird happened .
stuxnet verhielt , like a laborratte that didn &apos;t like our cheese -- schnüffelte , but wouldn &apos;t eat it .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we &apos;ve been experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i was looking at that this is a gezielter attack .
looking at a particular goal .
the dropper streift active in the gray box , when a particular configuration was discovered , and even if this particular program , which is trying to give it to this goal .
and if not , stuxnet doesn &apos;t do anything .
so , that really got my interest , and we started working , almost about the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it may , for example , for example , say , for example , a us- american power station , or a chemieanlage in germany .
so we should be able to figure out what the goal is .
so , extrahierten and dekompilierten , we found the angriffs- code , and what we found in two digital &apos;s -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also noticed that they were very professional , of people who had obviously had all the insider- information .
they knew whatever bits of bits and bytes that they had to attack .
you probably knew the schuhgröße of the maschinenbedieners .
so they knew everything .
and if you already realized that the dropper of stuxnet complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the nutzdaten are a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here &apos;s a clip from this angriffs- code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
looks pretty much like old-fashioned assemblersprache .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart in this code .
so what we were looking at as the first was systemfunktions- , because we know what they do .
and then we looked for timern and datenstrukturen , and we were trying to bring this to the real world -- potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could take or prove .
so to make these theories , we call ourselves a reminder that it &apos;s definitely about hochgradige sabotage , it has to be a hochwertiges goal , and very likely it &apos;s in iran , because most infections were reported .
well , in this field , there &apos;s no thousand goals .
and basically , it &apos;s going out on the buschehr and in natanz .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; i &apos;m going to get a list of all experts for zentrifugen and nuclear power plants . &quot;
and i called them and zapfte her , to compare their expertise to what we had to figure out in the code .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to make the little digital sprengkopf with the rotorsteuerung .
and it &apos;s the moving part of this moving in the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulated the speed of this rotors , you actually , in the situation , and actually , to explode the centrifuge .
what we &apos;ve found out is that the goal of the attack was in fact that the goal of the attack was to leave it slowly and unheimlich -- clearly in the attempt to try to leave , so that she won &apos;t be able to get quickly behind it .
the great digital sprengkopf -- we got a glimpse by looking at the way we looked at the same data and datenstrukturen .
so , for example , the number 164 is very out of that code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
and i started doing this , scientific literature , about how to be built in natanz , and found that they &apos;re strukturiert in so-called kaskaden , and each kaskade contains 164 .
so that made sense , it fit .
and it was even better .
these zentrifugen in iran are divided in 15 called the levels .
and guess what we found in the angriffscode ?
almost identical structure .
so again , this was really good together .
and this gave us great confidence for that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it didn &apos;t just go .
these results have been achieved by several weeks .
and we were just running in a dead end and we had to neu us .
anyway , we found that both digital sprengköpfe is actually in one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little sprengkopf takes over a kaskade , and überdreht , and überdreht and überdreht it , and the big sprengkopf starts with six kaskaden in interaction and manipulated valves .
so , in the big one , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have what the goal is .
it &apos;s natanz and it &apos;s just natanz .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other targets could be made by stuxnet .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- made me really aus .
there &apos;s the gray box down there , and on top of it , you see the zentrifugen .
now , what this thing is done is that it makes the eingehenden values of sensors -- so for example of drucksensoren and vibrationssensoren -- and it provides legitimen code , which is still with the attack , with wrong data .
and in fact , this falschen data is taken from stuxnet before .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywoodfilmen , where the überwachungskamera is fed with vorher videoaufnahmen videoaufnahmen .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea of this is obviously not just the maschinenbediener maschinenbediener in the control .
in fact , it &apos;s a lot more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to überlisten a digital sicherheitssystem .
we need digital sicherheitssysteme where a human maschinenbediener can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power plant , for example , if the big dampfturbine is going to be fast , you have to open entlastungsventile within milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human maschinenführer .
so at this point we need digital sicherheitssysteme .
and if you &apos;re at risk , then really bad things can happen .
the power station can explode .
and neither the maschinenführer , the sicherheitssystem will notice .
this is scary .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is generisch .
he has nothing to do with zentrifugen , with urananreicherung .
so , for example , he would work as well -- in a power station or in a power plant .
it &apos;s generisch .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the angreifer -- you don &apos;t have to put the nutzdaten on a usb- stick , as we &apos;ve seen it in stuxnet .
you could also use ordinary wurm- technology technology .
you have to spread it as far as possible .
and when you do that , you get a cyber- massenvernichtungswaffe .
this is the consequence that we have to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
it &apos;s in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas are the zielreichsten environments .
we need to make the consequences , and we &apos;re starting to prepare better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it became a lot of that people assume that the mossad is the hauptorganisation behind it .
is that your mind ?
okay , you really want to know ?
yeah . okay .
i think the mossad is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the cyber- superpower .
there &apos;s only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- happiness , for happiness .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for having a heidenangst eingejagt . thank you . thanks ralph .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years to place in situations that usually are very difficult , and they &apos;re sort of dangerous .
i went to jail -- difficult .
i worked in a kohlebergwerk -- dangerous .
i was filmed in kriegsgebieten -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days trying to spend nothing like this -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to the biggest part of my career to fürchterlichen situations , and it &apos;s all the way for trying to look at social belang , and it &apos;s interesting , and hopefully in a way to understand what they do for the audience fun .
so when i knew i was going to come here to look at a tedtalk of branding and sponsoring and sponsoring , i knew i would do something a little different .
some of you may have heard about that i took an ad on ebay a few weeks ago .
i sent out a few facebook-nachrichten , some twitter-nachrichten , and i gave people the opportunity to erstehen the namensrechte of my tedtalk in 2011 .
i &apos;m sure , some happy people and companies , i &apos;m sure -- because i &apos;m sure that chris anderson would never be given that -- to buy the namensrechte at the talk you just see , who &apos;s not a title of a lot of content , and not a lot of evidence of what the topic would actually be .
so what you got was this : your name here : my tedtalk , which you have no idea what &apos;s going to be going on , and you have the ears in the end of the end of the ears that could fly the ears , especially , if i put your involvement on your involvement .
but again , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
this is just the arbeitstitel .
so despite this warning , i knew that anybody would buy the namensrechte .
so if you asked me , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to have been able to tell you this .
but in the new project that i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the ad .
as i said , i &apos;ve gone into some pretty terrible situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing was able to get me on anything that was so difficult and as dangerous as with these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea of a film .
what i want to do is a film about product placement , marketing and advertising , with the whole film , by product placement , marketing marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the greatest movie ever . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the greatest movie &quot; is that it &apos;s all happened , from the top to the end , is that everything , from the top to the end , completely with brands , which you see in the movie , which is the brand .
now this brand , the qualcomm stadion , the staples center ...
these people will be connected to the film in eternity -- forever .
and so the film is going to look at this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a redundante person .
that was more on guilt .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to have the brand x as titelsponsor , but we &apos;ll make sure we &apos;re going to sell every single category in the movie .
we may sell a shoe , and it will be the greatest shoe you ever carried ...
the greatest car they &apos;ve ever been on , from &quot; the greatest movie ever , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , &quot; the greatest movie ever . &quot;
so , the idea is to show that brands are a part of life , actually , actually , to fund the film ?
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of statten .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to the end .
and i would be happy if ceg would help to do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how empfänglich people will be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; angle , &quot; because this has a negative konnotation -- but you know how to develop this ?
how much money is needed to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s going to be hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth it , some really , some really well-known brands .
who knows when the film comes out , we might look like a whole bunch of horde .
what do you think the answer is ?
and the answer is probably &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing about the film or a difficult thing for me ?
jk : both .
so , so , not so optimistic .
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people that you have to do .
there are some places that we can apply .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera &quot; would mean that we wanted to have a hintergrundgespräch .
it turned out that it was in reality , &quot; we want to have nothing to do with your film . &quot;
and just so all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
no wanted to do something with the film .
i was amazed .
they wanted nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising , your product as many people as possible to present as possible as a lot of people as possible .
in the world today , at this intersection of new and old media and the zerstückelten media media -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting vermittlungsinstrument , that the mass of this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a fatalen mistake , and that was the following .
in fact , no , this was not the mistakes at all .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but that &apos;s what this picture is , is a problem .
look , if you put transparency transparency in the google-suche , this is -- this is one of the first images that seems to be .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and tücke , just to discover and durchschauen ; and by charakterisiert , by sichtbarkeit and the access to information , especially what &apos;s geschäftspraktiken -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a whole lot about transparency .
our politicians tell us , our president says , even our ceos say it .
but if it comes to that , it &apos;s going to be done , something is changing .
but why ? now , transparency is fear einflößend -- like this strange bear , who still brüllt .
it &apos;s unvorhersagbar -- like this strange landstraße .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is any risky ?
a whole dish cool to eat .
that &apos;s risky .
so when i started talking to companies and to tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid , and my father caught me in lying -- and he &apos;s sitting there , and he &apos;s watching me -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions in every story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version version .
but there &apos;s only one company that was willing to help us -- and it &apos;s only because i knew john bond and richard kirshenbaum for years , i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to deal with the mittelsmann , and i had to go directly with my team .
so what they suddenly began to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , a broad problem .
i have friends who make big giant hollywood-filme , and i have friends , the little independent-filme like me .
and my friends , the big , huge hollywood-filme , say that the reason their movies are so successful in the markenpartnern that they have .
and then my friends , who are doing little independent-filme , &quot; well , how do we compete with these big , giant hollywood-filmen ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
so , how exactly will we see ban in the movie ?
whenever i go to the way to do it , and whenever i open the medizinschrank , you &apos;ll see ban deodorant .
and every time i interviewe somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you right ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so maybe you should get a little bit of this . &quot;
and then we have one of these great düfte .
either &quot; floral fusion &quot; or a &quot; paradise fusion &quot; , &quot; you &apos;ll have choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped both for men as well for women -- solid , roll-on , or stick , whatever .
this is the kurzfassung .
now i can answer all of your questions and give you a ausfühliche frames .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget as other brands .
so doing things like this -- you know , you know , people -- it &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
what would you describe ban ?
ban is blank .
that &apos;s a great question .
überlegene technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone else does .
we talk from bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word , that category really makes the positive thing , as opposed to &quot; fighting smell smell and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh -- better , more fresh , more fresh , more fresh air .
these things have a positivere effect .
and this is a millionen-konzern .
what about me ? what about the druchschittstypen ?
i have to talk to the man on the street that are like me , otto-normal-verbraucher .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like beautiful clothes .
&apos; 80s : &apos; 80s &apos;s hit in skaterpunk , except .
well , what is the brand gerry ?
unique .
i think the genre , the way that i have , is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of grautöne and a stuff .
but normally i have a accessoire , like sonnenbrillen , or a jewelry , or an jewelry .
if dan would be a brand , it &apos;s probably going to be a classic .
the brand i am , i &apos;m going to say , lässige fly fly .
woman 2 : partly hippie , part yogi , partly brooklyn-mädchen -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the schmusetyp .
i &apos;ll sell schmusetiere throughout the country , worldwide .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , verzerrten industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex because i were ausliefere .
brand five : brand gescheiteter alkoholsüchtiger .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a anwaltsmarke .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the tom-marke , but i &apos;m often looking at the interface of dark glamour and lässiger &apos;s fly .
and what was noticed was that i needed a experts .
i needed someone who could really help me understand what &apos;s called the markenpersönlichkeit .
and so i found a company called olson zaltman in pittsburg .
they have companies like nestle , febreze , hallmark helped to discover these markenpersönlichkeit .
if you could do it for that , you could also help me .
you brought your pictures , yes ?
this is what i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit like that with your thoughts and feelings about it .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about this world .
md : this world ? i think the world is the world where you live -- like humans around you , the friends , the family , the way you live life , the work and so .
all these things came from and begin to come from a place , and they start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
the next day . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what is the idea about the thoughts and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like strange things .
tell me about why &quot; -phase -- what does it bring us ?
what is the machete ? what puppenstadium are they going on ?
why is it important , neuzustarten ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about you &apos;re not .
what else do you go through ?
don &apos;t have to be afraid . in what kind of rollercoaster you are ?
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
thank you for your patience .
yeah . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to make .
there were a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their markenpersönlichekti have two separate , but ergänzende pages -- that morgan spurlock-marke is a achtsame / verspielte brand .
it &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction .
and i think some companies are just going to focus on a strength , rather than both .
and it &apos;s the human nature -- and this is the human nature -- and this is the human nature -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- and that they &apos;re going to be welcome to these things , and they turn them to themselves in something positive , and that &apos;s a geschickter schachzug .
what other brands are doing ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it , target , target , mini , mini coopers and jetblue .
well , there are verspielte brands and achtsame brands , those things coming and go , but a verspielte , achtsame brand is a pretty strong thing .
a achtsame , verspielte brand . how is your brand ?
if someone would ask them to describe their markenidentität , their markenpersönlichkeit , how would they be ?
do they make them a up-attribut ? are you something that brings blood in wallungen ?
or are they more like a down-attribut ?
are you something that &apos;s a little quiet , reservierter , conservative ?
up-attribute are things that are verspielt , fresh like the fresh prince , zeitgemäß , abenteuerlich , abenteuerlich , ausgefallen and agil , wendig , wendig , wendig and agile , herrisch , magical and mystisch like gandalf .
or are they more like a down-attribut ?
are they achtsam and mondän like 007 ?
are they established , traditionally , pflegend , compassionate , compassionate like oprah ?
are it reliable , stable , sicher , safe , heilig , sacred , bedacht and the dalai lama lama ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies that were up and down-firmen and they were saying , &quot; no , &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this film because they had no control , no control over the finished product .
but we found 17 markenpartner who were willing to give up with someone who were willing to do with someone who were willing to do with someone who were willing to do with someone , and we eventually have to tell stories that we don &apos;t usually have to tell -- stories that usually would never support .
they befähigten us to tell the story of the neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this film , that you &apos;re using mris today , you know , to the lustzentren of the brain , both for advertising and films .
we went to sao paulo , where außenwerbung has been banned .
in the entire city , for five years , no anzeigentafel , no poster , no flyer , nothing .
and we drove in school in school where companies are coming out of their path in verarmte schools , in all of america .
the incredible thing to me is that the projects that i got most feedback or where i had the biggest success , those are where i &apos;ve been interagierte with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
because they umgingen the mittelsmann , they umgingen the agencies , and they said that the agencies may not have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and make something completely different , something that people are thinking about thinking that our world challenges .
and how did that be for you ? what it successful ?
now , because the film at the sundance film festival had , we can look at this .
according to burrelles , the first is in january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- 900 of this film .
this is actually just one period of two 1 / two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn &apos;t been driving .
there isn &apos;t even online . no streaming .
he &apos;s not coming out of other countries .
well , finally , the film has got a very big momentum .
and this is not bad for a project that almost every werbeagentur , which we talked about who we talked about their clients to make their clients .
something that i believe is that if you take your chance to take care of your chance to take risks that in these risks .
i think when you keep people from it , then you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you trained his employees to avoid risks , you &apos;ve got the entire company prepared to get a profit .
i feel that we have to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunities that they might verängstigen .
finally , we should go forward to the fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
they welcome fear . they welcome the risk .
each one of them is full of , we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , it makes us a little bit more honesty .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; they welcome transparency transparency by my good friends of emc , who pay $ namensrechte for the namensrechte for the namensrechte .
big data is turned into large opportunities around the world .
emc : &quot; they welcome transparency &quot;
thank you .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency this : what happened to the $ $ ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i &apos;ve got a check in my pocket , on the oberorganisation of the ted-organisation , the sapling-stiftung -- a check out of $ 7100 to fund my ted-auftritt in the next year .
my name is amit .
18 months ago , i made something else at google , and i regte to do something with museums and art , and my chefin , which is now , gave me the green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of spaßiger negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and her access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education for more -- i don &apos;t -- but i had no access to many museums and this works .
when i went to visit and visit these museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i worked for google , i tried to do this desire -- i tried to make art accessible -- to bring technology together .
we then set up a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
so you go to googleartproject.com. .
you can look around in all these museums .
there is the uffizi , the moma , the rijks , the van gogh .
i even come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get in two because of it -- very simple .
click , and wumms , is in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you go around and amüsiert itself .
they want to do in the museum ?
open up the map , and jump on a click .
they &apos;re in there , they want to go to the end of the gangs .
just further . a lot of fun .
look through it .
thank you , but the best one is .
now , i &apos;m in front of one of my lieblingsbilder , erntearbeiter breugel breugel .
i see this pluszeichen .
if the museum gave us the picture , you click on it .
so this is one of the images .
this is all metadaten .
those of you who are really interested in art , can click here -- but i &apos;ll click away now .
this is one of the images that we call it on the so-called gigapixel-technologie .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion bildpunkte , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you this .
you can be very easily and rauszoomen .
you see something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unbezahlbar .
but then they really want to go deep inside .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there is something happening there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close to the end , and i realized slowly that these kids actually beat something .
i worked a little bit of research with some known thing with some known in the met , and actually found that it &apos;s a game called squail , where a gans is beaten on a stick with a stick .
it seems quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
in order to go close , you can go to the rissen .
just to give you the überblick , i &apos;ll show you what you can see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best one else -- in a second .
let &apos;s jump at moma , again in new york .
another lieblingsbild of me , sternennacht .
in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the pinselstriche ?
and what happens if you want to see how van gogh created this masterpiece ?
you go in . you can really go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom into one of my lieblingsteile this image until i really am the rissen .
this is sternennacht , probably never before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing the time .
this is the really cool part , he &apos;s called the collections .
every one of them , everybody -- whether rich poor , whether they have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
they can go and create their own museum online -- from all these images , they can put their own collection .
very simple , they go in -- and i created this , it means the power of zoom -- you can umherzoomen .
this is the gesandten , in the nationalgallerie .
you can put everything on your friends , send your friends , and you start a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think finally , to conclude , is the main thing that all the wonderful things are not coming from google .
they &apos;re not even coming out of the museums .
i might not be able to say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re just going to represent this digital medium of art , and they just represent online .
and the biggest question that i asked me recently is , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a museumsbesuchs ? &quot;
the answer to that is no .
it &apos;s called the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided in two camps .
this is the left half , which is the logical side and then the rights half , which is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the aptitute of every hemisphere , we could represent your brain .
for instance , this is somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you positionieren your brain on that scale ?
some of us may have decided to have one of us , but i think that , for most people in the audience , their brain looks about this kind of -- with a high aptitute that is at the same time .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both exclusive or something like that .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and this is what i see as one of the people in common experimental experimental quantenphysikern , which need a good amount of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition to actually perform the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love playing with things .
so we go out and play with it , and see how it responds , and then we start developing our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the trials they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing can only be in a place at the same time .
i mean , it can be weird to think that one thing at the same time is two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed it .
i remember a child playing playing on a bodenschwelle .
he was still a kleinkind and not very good at it , and he fell constantly .
but i bet that playing is a very valuable lesson to play a very valuable lesson , which is the big things you don &apos;t just leave you , and you &apos;re going to stay in .
and this is a great konzeptionelles model of the world , so long they &apos;re not teilchenphysiker .
it would be a terrible model for a teilchenphysiker because they &apos;re not playing with bodenschwellen , but with these little strange particles .
and if you play with your particles , imagine all kinds of weird things -- how they fly directly through walls , or that they can be at the same time in two different places .
and so they were writing all these observations , and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics .
that was the state of physics a few years ago ; they took quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
that &apos;s not like my intuition , and maybe just because i don &apos;t often play with particles .
well , i play with you sometimes , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
i mean , no one has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it .
because if all of the things are out of particles and all these particles the rules the rules of quantum mechanics , shouldn &apos;t just be just the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that was not supposed to be .
so i &apos;d better feel better with the whole thing , if we could kind of show that alltagsgegenstände is the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i did a few years ago to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in the quantenmechanischen superposition .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see that green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
here i get it up . we &apos;re looking at the center right here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up close-up of this little bit of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal it &apos;s actually shaped , and it &apos;s shaped over the edge .
so i made this thing in similar ways to make a computer a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new siliziumscheiben , and rackerte for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to create this kind of swimming pool , and getting this thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the quantenmechanischen , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i &apos;m doing all sorts of weird things , and then i &apos;m going to get other people , and i &apos;ll stop doing all these things , because i don &apos;t want to do it with it , or , frankly , they &apos;re verschrecke .
so quantum mechanics says that unbewegliche objects are just as comfortable .
it &apos;s not only people , it &apos;s not just humans , but the light that seems to them and the wind and the wind and the heat and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal acts , we had to schmeissen all the mitreisenden out .
and then we did .
we &apos;ve turned out the light , we put it into a vacuum and saugten it into a vacuum and kühlten the entire air , and so far in the elevator alone , in the elevator , was free to behave like it .
so we measured its movement .
we found that it really moves strange .
instead of that , rather than it &apos;s a little quiet , the way it , the way it was like this , like this -- like this -- like a ausdehnender and zusammen blasebalg .
when we gave him a little push , we could allow it to vibrate at the same time , and not vibrate -- something that is just going to happen in the quantum mechanics .
so , what i &apos;m telling you is what truly fantastic fantastic .
what does it mean to vibrate for the object at the same time and not vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion of atoms in which the piece of metal are still there , and at the same time , they move the same atoms and down .
it &apos;s just accurate stimmen .
the rest of the time are delokalisiert .
that means that every atom at the same time is two different places , which means that the whole piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth me for all this year in the green room , because , check that , the massstabsunterschied between a single atom and this piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , this piece of metal can be two different places , why don &apos;t you ?
i mean , this is just what my logical side says .
so , imagine you &apos;d be at the same time , how would that feel like that ?
how would your mind deal with that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we aufwärmten it , the light and the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator is actually just quanten objects that are gefercht in a small space .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
now , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more than that , it goes deeper deeper .
it &apos;s like these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the tiefsinnige and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should think we should think about economic development .
it should be that when families are thinking about where families are thinking about where they live and work , the opportunity to pick up between at least one hand full of different cities that are all standing in competition in competition .
now we are far away from that goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries that don &apos;t even have a single city that they &apos;d welcome to .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs them .
so we could just einfach the world very simple with duzenden , maybe hundreds of new cities .
this may sound absurd to you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
and they &apos;re just building homes against the cities .
imagine half of the people who want to live in apartments , this already ; they did not do the other half .
they could try to extend the capacity to extend existing apartments .
but you know what they were going to be going to be about , in these apartments , and its environment and its environment , to avoid , and from ausbau ausbau .
so it turns out to be very hard to meet all of this .
but you could go to a completely new place , and build a whole new block of the laws that the laws were going on there , and not behindern .
so i &apos;ve proposed that governments create new surfaces that offer enough space for a city , and gave you a name : charter cities .
i figured out later , i found that , around the same time , javier and octavio about the challenge of a reform of reform .
and they knew that every year , every year , would leave their country in the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and can do exactly the same thing .
if we just put a unbesiedelte area of the american surface of our country , what happens if we just go to a unbesiedelte area of our country , what happens if we just want to make a message of our country , which is the united states , or the united states , you can work there , and you can do anything on the surface of these messages , what they usually had to go to canada or america ? &quot;
in summer in 2009 , they had a major heftigen .
in the next planmäßigen elections , pepe lobo in a shift , whose program would say both innovations and schlichtung .
he challenged octavio to be stabschef .
in the meantime , i prepared a talk at tedglobal .
through improvement , test out and through consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter city of the wesentlichen city .
the first thing is the importance of laws , laws that determine that we &apos;re not allowed to keep existing wohnungsbesitzer .
we give up new technologies , but for progress , it needs technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that help us help .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
again , he showed him javier .
they were calling me .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country . &quot;
so we met in december of the sitzungssaal of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they are .
and i used this graph to show how valuable rohland is in a place like new york . think that a area in some cases is worth thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a place when there was a pause , he said , &quot; paul , maybe we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk , in a very simple shape , that a charter city is a place , which is a anfang city , in the beginning , which is the laws of the laws that is there , and the people who offers the ability to decide either under those rules or not .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president &apos;s president , who meant that we have this project to happen , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to fix our country .
i was asked to go to tegucigalpa , and i was a talk to the fourth of january of january .
so i &apos;ve given another one with facts &apos;s talk , which is a graph like this , which has tried to illustrate that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch of the new airport that was built in denver .
this is a surface of 100 quadratkilometern alone .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the honduraner , if you want to build a new city , you want to start with at least 1,000 quadratkilometern .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand morning .
polite all applaudiert .
the faces of the audience were very serious and paying attention .
the head of congress came up , and he said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we might look at this tedtalk .
i &apos;ve got it on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and you played this tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the punch line that a new city provides people new possibilities .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also includes new opportunities for leaders .
and the leaders of the government , they would depend on the help of partnerländern , and they could benefit from their partnerländern , they could benefit from the laws of this charter , and they would support that everybody can trust the charter .
and the knowledge of president lobo was that the faith that i &apos;ve thought about as a way to bring foreign investors , as a way to get the foreign investors and build this city for all parties for many years , which has been under fear of fear mistrust .
we &apos;ve been in an area .
this picture is from this place .
it &apos;s mühelos a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly after that , at the 19th of january , they voted at congress for a change in the constitution to have a verfassungsgemäße policy control that is special entwicklungsgebiete .
in a country that &apos;s just a heftige crisis of crisis , in the congress , in the congress for this verfassungsänderung .
all the parties , all the fraktionen of society , supported this .
but to become part of the constitution , it must be approved twice by congress .
on the 17th , it was approved to the second time with 114 .
immediately after this choice , between the 21st and the 24 february , a delegation of about 30 hunduranern to the world that were most interested in the world that were most interested in the business of the städtebaus .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new city , which in south korea built in south africa as a bostons of the city .
everything you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the genehmigungen .
the other place that was very interested in the urbanism is singapore .
it &apos;s built two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re thinking about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a baugrundstück , and they consider that area for the second city .
it &apos;s already been working on a legal system that allows us to participate , and it &apos;s also working on a external legal system .
a country has already offered the supreme court to provide as a court for the entgültige appeal of the dortigen system .
städtedesigner and -bauer and -bauer are very interested .
they actually bring funding into funding .
one thing , as you already know , was totally understood , there are many mieter .
there are a lot of these businesses like to put in america , especially in a place with a freihandelszone , and there are many people who would like to live there .
all over the world there is 700 million people saying that they would like to live in another place .
a million people leave a year every year and go to the united states .
a lot of you are fathers who are forced to be forced to get your families , sometimes it &apos;s single mothers who have enough money to make enough money to eat and eat clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes kids who are even kids who are trying to find their parents trying to find their parents in some cases , in some cases , for a decade .
so what is it for an idea to think about a totally new city ?
or even duzende from these cities , or are hundreds of all around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to insist that every family has a choice between multiple cities that are in competition for new residents ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
so my friends from , i asked me to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions do you do in a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve been making a survey with 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices , the average american , is a typical american .
in addition , a study was done with ceos that they saw for a week for a week .
and these scientists just documented the different topics with those ceo , and how much time they were making decisions that relate to the issues .
and they found that an average ceo of average ceo in the week with 139 tasks .
so each of these subjects , of course , of course , of many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions have been made within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions they needed an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
you know how many decisions you &apos;re going to meet in the nine minutes in the nine minutes of view of an hour ?
how good , do you think of dealing with the decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the largest entscheidungsprobleme of our modern time , the entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem .
i want to talk about the problem , and talk about some possible solutions .
now , if i &apos;m talking about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise them because i &apos;m blind , just the hand , if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , please , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question for today is : are you ready to hear about the entscheidungsüberlastungsproblem ?
thank you .
when i was a abschlussstudent at stanford university , i went to this very , very exklusiven store ; at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store called the draeger .
this business , it was almost like a vergnügungspark .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and vegetables and vegetables , and more than two dozen different kinds of water , and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we actually drink leitungswasser .
i loved to go to this business , but at a time i asked myself , well , what &apos;s going to be like you never kaufst ?
here &apos;s the olive oil .
they had 75 different oil olive oil , including those who were embedded in boxes , came from thousands of thousands of oil .
so i decided one day to go to leaders , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model that you really offer people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up on the busladungen of tourists that came every day , and they usually had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose marmelade for our experiment .
here &apos;s her marmeladen gang .
they had 348 different kinds of marmelade .
we &apos;ve put a little verkostungsecke directly on the entrance .
we have put six different tastes there , or 24 different tastes , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , what would more people would stand up and try marmelade ?
there are more people left when they were 24 , about 60 percent when they were six percent , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what people were more likely to buy a glass of glass .
now we saw the opposite effect .
from the people , when they were 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of marmelade .
and the people who were standing when they were six , well , now we saw that 30 percent of you actually bought a glass of marmelade .
now , if you calculate it , the people bought six times a glass of marmelade , who they had six to the choices when they had 24 of them .
well , not to buy a glass of marmelade is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our taille -- but it turns out that we can also affect us very konsequenzreichen decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even though it comes against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day , financial .
i &apos;m going to describe to you a study now that i was doing with gur huberman , emir kamenica , wei jang , where we were making the decisions for retirement , almost a million americans from about 650 plans in the entire united states .
and what we &apos;re looking at was whether the number of fondsangebote was possible to be able to be able to affect the 401 plan , the 401 plan that &apos;s more likely to be saved tomorrow .
and we found that there was a context in fact .
so in those plans plans , we had about 657 plans that people do something between two to 59 fund .
and what we found was that the more fund was offered that the more fund , in fact , in fact , the participation &apos;s participation .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans , the two fund , a teilnahmerate in the 1970s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that anboten almost 60 fund , the teilnahmerate now fell around about the sechzigsten prozentanteil .
now turns out that even if you were to participate , if you have more opportunities to get a choice , even then it has negative consequences .
so , the people who decided to participate , is that the more possibilities they were available , the more likely to choose to choose it and to fund .
the more possibilities they were available , the more they put their money in pure geldmarktkonten .
none of these extreme decisions , to make the decisions that anyone would recommend when they care about the future financial well-being .
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three crucial consequences in humans that provide more and more and more choices .
they &apos;re going to make the decision -- push them , even if it against their own best .
they &apos;re more likely to make worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re going to decide for things that they make themselves feel less content , even if they make objective better .
so the main reason that we might enjoy it is that we may enjoy this huge shelves of mayonaise , mustard , essig and marmelade , but we don &apos;t actually take the comparison , and then in fact , in fact , we can choose some of the fantastic supply .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested on different ways -- which you can just use in your business .
first of all the first .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today that is less .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; 4 . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing regalfläche .
but in fact , we &apos;re looking at more and more that if you &apos;re willing to be willing , and the unwichtigen possibilities , you know , you know , there &apos;s a rise of sales , and it will cost the cost of sales , it will be brought down to the cost of &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s a improvement of entscheidungswahrnehmung .
as a proctor and gamble , the different head and shoulders species of 26 to 15 , they experienced an increase in sales by sales .
when the golden cat corporation sold her 10 at the worst katzenstreus corporation , she experienced that the profit is about cover percent -- a result of the two , the sales of sales and the reduction of cost .
you know , the average supermakrt today is providing you about 45,000 products .
a typical walmart walmart is giving you 100,000 products .
but the neuntgrößte supermarket , which today is aldi supermarket in the world today , and they can only give you 40,000 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in a dose .
now in the world of the sparens , i think the best of the examples that have recently got to the market , was something that david laibson was very strong , in which david has very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
and every harvard harvard employees now takes automatically on a lebenszeitfond part .
those who want to make a choice will be offered by 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to tell it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i have the employees is , &quot; tell me , how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if their employees can &apos;t auseinanderhalten them , they can &apos;t do it . &quot;
now , before we started now , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer all the people in this audience in this audience to offer a all-inklusive holiday in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i &apos;d like to read them .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read , and i ask you to clap , if you &apos;re willing to assume gary &apos;s offer .
okay . everybody who &apos;s ready to adopt gary &apos; offer .
are that all ?
well , let me show you something more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i might have heard more hands .
good .
in fact , that &apos;s what you &apos;re looking at when the first time you had more information than the second time , but i would have to guess that you felt it in the second time .
because the images made it real sense for them .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you cope with the problem of entscheidungsüberlastung , it &apos;s the konkretisierung .
it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between possibilities , understanding what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that these consequences have to be vivid and specific .
why are people about 15 to 30 percent more when they use a ec-karte or a card card than in cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t really matter .
and it turns out that if you make it that something feels more specific , it feels a very good tool , so you get people to save more .
so , in a study that i &apos;ve done with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero , we &apos;ve made a study with the people in ing -- employees that have all worked for ing -- and these people were all in a meeting where they launched their participation for their rentensparplan .
and as this session , we &apos;ve got this meeting as close as it was always , and we added a little bit more .
the small thing that we have on it was that we asked people to think about all positive things that would happen in their lives if they were going to save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation on 20 percent , and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or a increase by four percent on the amount they were willing to pay for the sparkonto .
the third technique : kategorisierung .
we can deal with more categories than to deal with more choices .
here &apos;s for example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a zeitschriftengang .
it turns out that it turns out in the wegmans and down in the northeast , in the northeast area , the number of magazines exploded to 664 magazines .
but you know what ?
if i &apos;m going to show you 600 magazines , and i &apos;m going to give you 400 magazines , or i &apos;m going to show you 400 magazines , you believe that i gave you more choices and a better auswahlerfahrung than i gave you the 400 , if i gave you the 600 .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different schmuckauslagen .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called swing . &quot;
if you think that the left display is swing , and the ad on the right is , you clap in your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
if you think that you &apos;re on the left side , and that , on the right side , you &apos;re clapping .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is swing , but you know what ?
this is a highly unnützes kategorisierungsschema .
the categories have to say to the auswähler something that provides the selection .
and this is a problem that often you , if you look at the long lists of all this fund .
who do you actually want to inform ?
my fourth technology : premise of complexity .
it turns out we can actually deal with more information than we think about more information than we think we have to simplify them .
we need to increase the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german autohersteller that gives you the opportunity to konfigurieren your car .
they have to make 62 different decisions to create their car completely .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices that they provide a decision .
autofarben , außenfarbe of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
what i &apos;m doing now is i change the order in the decisions .
half of the customers is going to go from the many possibilities , 56 autofarben to the low possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the customers goes from the low possibilities , four gears , to the 56 autofarben , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how are they interested .
now , if you &apos;re constantly using the decision , it means that you &apos;re being overwhelmed , the heisste , i &apos;m losing them .
what she &apos;s finding is that the people who go from the many to the low auswahlmöglichkteiten are always going to go and pick the standardauswahl .
we lose them .
go from the little choice to the many , then you &apos;ll stay on .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order to change this information .
when i start with the simple start , i &apos;m learning auswähle .
even though , even though the gears choose , nothing about my preferences in the interior says , i &apos;m still making it .
it versetzt me too excited about the big product , which i &apos;m zusammenstelle , and so i &apos;m ready to motivate me to get interested in an interest .
let me summarize .
i told you about four techniques that mildern the problem of the entscheidungsüberlastung -- just -- you &apos;re going to take the überflüssigen alternatives alternatives -- make it real ; it &apos;s real -- we do better -- we can do better with more categories , less ways to deal with .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m thinking about today is to help you manage to manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for people who they service service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re selective at human .
and the more we &apos;re going to choose to choose , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allocca , trends-manager on youtube . i &apos;m looking at youtube-videos .
that &apos;s true .
today , we want to talk about how videos are viral , and then that &apos;s why it &apos;s important .
we all want to be star -- berühmtheiten , singer , singers -- when i was young , it seemed so infinitely difficult .
but webvideos has allowed us that we all or all our creative activities can be incredibly famous in part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be on the internet to the next saturday famous .
but on youtube , more than 48 hours , more than 48 hours per minute .
it will only be a tiny percentage of times , and it &apos;s been looking at thousands of times and so thousands of times looked like this cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : tastemaker , teilnahmecommunities and the unexpected .
well , then we want .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
woah !
ohhhhh , wowwww !
last year , sendete bear vasquez of this video that he shot in front of his house in the high national park .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
this chart shows how it looked like when the video was popular for the first summer .
in fact , bear didn &apos;t do a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you do that if you do this , if you yosemite mountain bear .
he had uploaded a lot of naturvideos .
and this video was actually sent in the january .
what happened here ?
there was jimmy kimmel .
jimmy kimmel sendete the tweet that made the video so popular .
because tastemaker , like jimmy kimmel , give us new and interesting things and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday . gotta get down to the weekend , weekend get , &apos; , weekend , friday . friday , down , down , gettin , gettin . you didn &apos;t think that we would have this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
rebecca blacks friday is one of the most popular video of the year .
it was looking at almost 200 million times .
this is what the graph looked like .
just like the &quot; double rainbow &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; double &quot; the &quot; double . &quot;
what happened that day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also freitage .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
now , tosh.0 gabelte , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson nelson nelson nelson was a first one who was working on twitter .
it &apos;s important that a person or a group of tastemakers took up a standpoint with a big audience , and accelerated the process .
and then this community formed by people who shared these large insiderwitz , and began to talk about it .
now there are 10,000 parodien of &quot; friday &quot; with youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a parodie for every single day .
unlike the einseitigen conversation of the 20th century , the community is going to be part of the community to become part of the community -- either by indem it , or something new from it .
&quot; nyan cat &quot; is animation and music in endlosschleife .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year was seen almost 50 million times .
and if you think that &apos;s crazy , you must know that there &apos;s a dreistundenversion that &apos;s been looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at people who look at this video .
it &apos;s important , the creativity that are in the internetkultur of techies and geeks .
there was remixe .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole remix-gemeinde shot from the ground , which made it from a stupid joke to something that we all can participate in .
now , we don &apos;t just find pleasure on something , we do .
who would have voraussehen all this ?
who would have predicted &quot; the double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; . &quot;
what would you have been able to write in which drinsteht ?
in a world , in which every minute minute , in which every minute of the video , it can only be really unique and unexpected hervorstechen as they mentioned .
i &apos;m not going to be interested , i wasn &apos;t interested in a friend , when i said , i should have this great video , about a guy who &apos;s in new york strafzettel for bicycles .
i got a parking ticket because i &apos;m not on the radweg , but often there are challenges that don &apos;t make a very nice to drive .
because this was completely surprising , and humorous , casey niestats fun idea and his argument , five million times .
this approach is true for everything we &apos;re creative .
and that all leads us to a big question .
what does that mean ?
ohhhh .
what does that mean ?
tastemaker , creative teilnehmergemeinden , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to the audience in the audience .
as i said , one of the currently biggest stars -- justin -- made his start with youtube .
nobody has to give your ideas green light .
and today , we &apos;re all feeling as owners of our popular culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they &apos;re not going to meet the media from today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk to 10 minutes about three generations , in a little girl &apos;s life , and how the amazing strength of this connectedness is in a vierjährigen boat in a small boat , in a little boat in the chinese ocean , in a small boat in the chinese ocean , and one which is in the life of this little girl , and never disappeared -- this little girl who lives now live in san francisco and talks to you today ?
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
i want to tell you some of the puzzlestückchen .
imagine the first piece : a man who is burning his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life had been stuck together by the simple hope of oneness and freedom .
keep it in the einmarsch of kommunisten in saigon , as he must say that his life was a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , is now his friends .
he moved back in silence .
he died , broke through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgotten me his life .
i had to worry that it was not for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was really trying to zerdrücken us , but we through it .
the next puzzleteil shows , like a boat in the early morgenrot quiet on lake .
my mother may was 18 , when her father died -- in a arrangierten marriage marriage , with two little girls .
for her , life had asked one task : the flucht of your family and a new life in australia .
it was completely ausgeschlossen that it could fail .
after an vierjährigen and filmreifen saga glitt , a boat on the lake , as fischerboot .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the greatest fear had pirates , rape and death .
as most adults on the boat , my mom wore a little giftflasche .
if you had a gefangennahme , i would just have my sister and i &apos;d like you , and then drink my grandmother .
my first memories are from that boat boat -- the steady of the engine of the engine of the engine , the clapping of every wave and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates who came many times , but from the todesmut of the men of men on our boat , or the ausfall of the engine that didn &apos;t want six hours .
but i remember the lights of the ölplattform in front of the coast of the coast of the malaysischen , and the young man who died and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the flavor of the first apfels that gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple ever geschmeckt .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next puzzlestück is about four generations in three generations , which are building a new life together .
we let us go down in footscray , one of the arbeiterklasse ground of vorort , whose population is made of immigrantenschichten .
unlike the alteingesessenen mittelklassevororten , whose existence was completely unknown to me , there was no anspruchsdenken in footscray .
the smell of the ladentüren came from the rest of the world .
and the fetzen broken englischs in between people who had a thing together , they started neu .
my mother worked on farms , then on a fließband line , six days , twice .
they kind of managed to find the time , english and it-qualifikationen .
we were poor .
every dollar has been given , and was put in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to give up for that . mostly the new stuff that came out of the second hand .
two couple of strümpfe for school , every one to cover the holes in the other .
a schuluniform to the knöcheln , because she had to do six years .
and there were the rare aber chöre of &quot; schlitzauge , &quot; schlitzauge , &quot; and there &apos;s da : &quot; grandmothers , go home . &quot;
where ?
something versteifte in me .
there was a meeting meeting the reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and we were listening to the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother was suffering from the boat .
and it was my job to wake up every night , until the alpträume came , so i could aufwecken it .
she opened up a computergeschäft , then she took a kosmetikerausbildung and opened up a business .
and the women came along with their stories of men who are not ertrugen , angry and unflexibel , and sorgenerfüllte children , caught between two worlds .
darlehen and donors were looking for .
centers were built .
i lived in parallelwelten .
in one of them , i was the classic asian student , the unerbittliche demands of himself .
in the other , i was involved in uncertain lives , the tragic scars scars scars violence , the drogenmissbrauchs and isolierung .
but so many of the years of help .
and because of this aid , i was taken in my last year for the last year of jurastudiums .
and i was going to katapultiert from one puzzlestück to the next , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le footscray , anonymous bewohnerin from footscray , was there tan , refugee and social aktivistin , who was invited to talk about places that she had never heard , and in homes whose existence could never have imagined .
i was not familiar with the etikette .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the besteck .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back into a routine and the bequemlichkeit of life , a mother , and two daughters , a mother and two daughters , and two of her days , like 20 years , by telling each other the stories of their day and einschliefen , we &apos;re still in the same bed .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do it .
she reminded me that i was as old as she was at the time , when we had the boat .
no one was an opportunity .
&quot; do it just , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i was talking about jugendarbeitslosigkeit and education , and the vernachlässigung of the marginalisierten and entrechteten .
and the more open i talked about , the more i should tell .
i met people in all lebenslagen , so many of them did what they loved , lived in the limits of the possible .
and although i ended up with my degree , i realized i could not with a career in law .
there had to be another puzzlestück .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a tutor , ein in the picture -- and not just okay , but something you have to be grateful for , maybe a gift of boots .
because dazuzugehören can be so easy to collapse in the horizons collapse , so easily mean that you &apos;re accepted the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve gone enough to know enough to know that , yes , yes , the world auseinanderbricht , but not how to befürchtet it .
possibilities that didn &apos;t have been allowed to have been ermutigt .
there was a energy , an unerbittlichen optimism , a strange mixtur of humility and wagnisses .
so i followed my gut gut .
i collected a little team of people to me , for which the schublade &quot; is not a unwiderstehliche challenge .
we didn &apos;t have a cent for a year .
at the end of one of every tags , i cooking a huge drop soup that we shared .
we worked late to the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a couple of brilliant , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to draw in the u.s.
after just a journey there .
my gut again .
three months later , i was moved and the adventure continued .
and before i go to the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
it grew up at a time , in which the social norm the social norm and local english was the most important person .
life has been changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother moved her alone .
with 17 , she was the second woman in english , whose mother she proposed .
without support of her man &apos;s man , she took it for a sensation by dish by trial , and she was in her own case , and even bigger sensation than she won .
&quot; don &apos;t be a unwahr .
i just duschte in a hotel hotel in sydney hotel hotel when she died . 1,000 kilometers away in melbourne .
i looked through the duschtrennwand and looked at them on the other side .
i knew she was coming to pass himself .
my mom called me for a few minutes .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in footscray , and i sat around .
we told their stories and versicherten her stories that we were still with her .
to midnight midnight , the monk came and said he must close the sarg .
my mother asked us to touch their hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm , and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve been thinking about this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you don &apos;t wear it . &quot;
if it &apos;s in our family a band , it &apos;s through the women .
you see who we were and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men who may have come into our lives would have come into the quere .
defeat would have been too simple .
now i would like to have my own kids , and i think of the boat .
who ever wants to ever want ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilegien , ease , berechtigungsanspruch .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous every wave , the unbeirrte , stetige tuckern tuckern of the engine , the long horizon , the long horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give that , and it could be safe , i would do it .
another mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother today in the fourth or fifth .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it even photography ?
because this is , of course , a picture you can &apos;t pick up with your camera .
nevertheless , my interest in photography , when i received my first digital camera , age 15 years .
i put it on with my former predilection for drawing , but it was a little different , because when the camera was using the process , it was in planning .
and if you put a picture with a camera with a camera ends when you push the trigger .
so for me , photography seemed to be more about walking in the right place at the right time .
i thought everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that happens when it goes to the trigger .
pictures like this : one construction site along a much befahrenen road .
but it has an unexpected turn .
and yet , behaltet is a realistic level .
or pictures like this -- dark and farbenfroh at the same time , but all with the common goal to keep an realistic level .
if i say reality , i mean .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can actually capture , but i would let it look as if you could have this , on a photograph .
photos , where you have to think about a short moment , to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more like to capture an idea than a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what does the illusion create ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be done on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what realistic is realistic , but what we do for realistic .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i see you as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect vorstellbare physical objects that we &apos;re all able to identify with in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain ways , you can create something that &apos;s still three-dimensional than if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we überlisten our brains , because our brains don &apos;t really make sense that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combine by photographs .
it &apos;s really just to combine different realities .
so the things that make a picture realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you &apos;re just looking at it wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a realistisches outcome .
as you can see , it &apos;s not three special images .
but again , you can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined data should have photos the same perspective .
secondly , put together the same beleuchtungsart together .
and these two images meet these two demands -- shot from the same altitude and geschossen the same .
third , it &apos;s impossible to make it impossible , where the individual images begin and end by connecting them into a transition .
it &apos;s impossible to tell how the photo was actually put together .
so by indem the color , contrast and light on the edges of the individual images , wie , entsättigte , entsättigte colors and störungen colors , we have the limits the boundaries between the different images , and let them look like a single photograph , although a picture of a picture can basically contain hundreds of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a landscape , and it &apos;s the lower .
but this picture is actually completely composed from photos of different places .
i personally finde. that it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to make a compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to get them to find the different places for the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been taken on a anglerausflug .
the shore comes from another place .
the unterwasser-teil comes from a quarry .
and yes , i actually have the house up on the island of red umgefärbt to look like this look .
so to make a realistisches outcome , it &apos;s going from me in planning planning .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s a piece of very good plan .
and if you do good images , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
so it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that limited us limited is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic gesundheits-projekte fail .
and i think the most important thing is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we &apos;ve introduced to the radboud-universität was a haupt-zuhörer .
and they &apos;re not very scientific about this -- she &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea , and the patients , families families , relatives , &quot; how is it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everybody -- maybe most of the electronic gesundheits-projekte fail : because we stopped listening .
this is my wlan-waage . a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button .
and every morning i get on it .
and yes , i have a job , as you might recognize .
i have my job at 95 pounds of angesetzt .
it works very simple : every time i get to the scale , you send my data to google health .
and they &apos;re also going to abgerufen by my allgemeinarzt , so he can see where my gewichtsproblem is , and it &apos;s not just in the moment that i need to be kardiologische or so , but with a look at the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you know that , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 follower on twitter .
so every morning i get on my wlan-waage , and people talk to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; for lunch , just a little salat today , lucien . &quot;
but this is the netteste thing that can happen because this is the gruppenzwang to help patients help patients help patients because that could be used for obesity obesity , or it could give patients smoking .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and bring them to play some kind of game to control their health .
next week , it comes to the market .
it &apos;s going to be a little blutdruck-messgerät that you &apos;re going to be on an iphone or something like that .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from home to their arzt and share him with others , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients come to play . they can &apos;t only be the control of control of their own ship , but we can also help public health care of the challenges that are in front of us , and the kostenexplosion of health care , double demand , and so on .
make ways that are easy to use , and start with this to hug patients in the team .
and they can reach through these sorts of methods , but also by crowdsourcing .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we all have navigationssysteme in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all the machines are maastricht around .
we know one more where all the gas stations are .
and clear , we can find fastfood-ketten .
but where would the next aed to help this patient ?
we have herumgefragt , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next lebensrettende was finding in this moment .
so , what did we do ? we &apos;ve done crowdsourcing in the netherlands .
we built a website and asked a menschenmasse website , &quot; if you see a aed , please share us where it is , &quot; because sometimes it &apos;s closed during geschäftszeiten , of course .
and over 10,000 aeds , they have been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find apps .
and we have a ipad-app designed .
we &apos;ve developed an app for layar , extended reality , to find these aeds .
and if you &apos;re in a town like maastricht , and somebody goes down , you can use your iphone , and within the next couple of weeks , you can find the next aed to find the next aed that life can save .
and then we don &apos;t just want to do this as a aed4u , like the product calls , but also as aed4us .
and we want to put this on a global level .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues all over the world , from other universities , to help us to help , like knotenpunkte , to crowdsourcen around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation , and someone goes down , it is your own verwandtschaft or somebody else , you can find a aed .
the other thing that we want to ask is companies all around the world are helping us for bestätigung these aeds .
these could be kurierdienste , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the gemeldete aed still is still in its place .
please help us and try to do the health , not just just to improve it , but taking your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
i work in solartechnologie-branche .
and my little startup wants to force us to the environment by ...
get rid of the crowdsourcing .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take it until it geladen .
now -- we can just skip it -- i &apos;m just going to jump off the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
solartechnologie is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get stars in technology and to work in a year and work in a year that &apos;s pretty much everything they hate really hate , we have to work in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like friedenscorps .
we choose some of them every year , and we &apos;re going to work with stadtverwaltungen .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in rathäuser .
and they developed great apps , worked with urban employees .
but what you really do is to show what technology is possible today .
so you meet al .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
here it looks like after a date , but if he &apos;s looking for a date , if he &apos;s looking for a date , when he &apos;s eingeschneit , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good at brandbekämpfung when it &apos;s zugedeckt by a meter of snow .
how did he come to look for this particular kind of aid ?
we had a team of fellows in boston , this is the code for america for america .
they were in february , and it &apos;s got a lot of geschneit .
and they realized that the city never schaufelt those fires .
but a certain fellow , a man named erik michaels-ober , noticed another thing , and that was that the residents had the sidewalks to frei directly before these parts .
so he did what any good engineers would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire fire .
you stimmst to schaufeln , if it schneit .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you &apos;re not doing that , somebody can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that were written in the last year .
but she does something , which no other regierungstechnologie does .
it &apos;s rapidly spreading .
there &apos;s this guy in the i.t. department of the city , who saw that he could use this app app , not snow , but to adopt the citizens of tsunami-sirenen .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami-sirenen work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to test them .
and then , i decided to use seattle to use the app to clean the verstopften gullys .
and chicago has just introduced them , so the people die when it schneit .
we &apos;re now familiar with nine cities to use this app .
and it spread , organic , of course .
if you know something about regierungstechnologie , you know that it usually doesn &apos;t happen .
the beschaffung of software takes a few years .
we had a team that was working last year on a project in boston for three people to a half a half .
it was a way to find out the parents , which are the right public schools for their children .
we &apos;ve been told later , if it took over normal channels , it would have taken over two years , and it cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
there &apos;s a project right now in the california law that has cost two billion dollars so far , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of the government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading by selbt , a kind of shot the bug institution institution institution .
it shows how the government could work better -- no more like a private company , as many people think that she should .
and not even like a technik-unternehmen , but more like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more important to that app is that she represents a new generation , which is the problem of government -- not as the problem of an institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at the collective act with digital technology .
now there is a big community of people who make the tools that we need to do in order to do things effectively .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; there are hundreds of people all over the country who write up and writing , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re awful frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they repair .
and these people know something that we lost from their eyes .
and this is when you &apos;re all your feelings of politics and the snake , and all the other things that we really upset about is government , in the core , in the words of tim o reilly , &quot; what we do in common that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people gave up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i &apos;m going to you , you know , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally takes out of us -- erinner you , &quot; we were the people ? &quot; -- how we think about how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government than i started this program .
and as a lot of people , i thought that in the government , mainly to choose people in office .
now , after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s especially in communities , especially .
this is the call center for service and information .
you usually get out , if you &apos;re 311 in your city .
if you &apos;ve ever got the opportunity to work in your städtisches center , as a part of the program -- in fact , in fact , do that -- you &apos;re going to see that the people who are calling government for many different problems , including that a beutelratte is in your house .
so scott gets this anfruf .
he type &quot; beutelratte &quot; into the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the tierfänger .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you open all the doors in your house and see a very loud music , and see if the livestock is abhaut ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the beutelratten .
this is not just a call center .
it has an app , a web- and handy-app , called citizens connect .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is work very smart people in the office of new urban mechanics in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- came in this : &quot; beutelratte in my mülltonne . can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happened with &quot; citizens &quot; is different .
scott unterhielt himself to human .
but on &quot; citizens connect &quot; is all public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it looked a neighbor .
and the next point we got was , &quot; i went over there , found the mülltonne behind the house .
beutelratte ? it &apos;s alive .
turned the mülltonne on the side . went home .
good night , sweet beutelratte . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital of the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how to get the government .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean , this is a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m more like to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
she connected these two people .
and you would have to connect them with government , if they were required , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative alternative to state services .
when a neighbor helps the other , we make our communities .
let &apos;s call the tierfänger , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we have to think that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system .
how often we have chosen a political leaders -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re going to go back , and we expect the government , our values , and our needs our needs , and then didn &apos;t change much ?
this is because the government is going on like a further ocean and politics that are the top 15cm .
and what is that is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt , which is this thing that we have , and we pay for them to be something that works against us , something else , and then we entmachten ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the actual regierungsarbeit is happening .
we need to get to the machinery of government .
so the occupythesec-bewegung did it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of more concerned citizens who wrote a very detailed report , which is an answer to the sec-memo of the sec-memo .
this is not politically active , which is bürokratisch active .
now , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to ask .
do we really believe that we can achieve what we need to do without the institution to improve the institution of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology is making it possible , the function of the government , in a way that can actually achieve something by stärkt society .
and there &apos;s one generation that has grown up the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the only systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up to see your voice as granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this struggle that we all fight , about who &apos;s allowed to speak ; they all have to talk .
you can make your opinion , on every channel at every time , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of the government , you don &apos;t take care of your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the work of government .
and this apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
that could be a fire fire , a hydranten mülleimer , a trash trash with a beutelratte .
and sure , we would have these fire fires all the time , and many people do do .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of government who pay taxes and receive taxes .
we &apos;re more than that , we are citizens .
and we won &apos;t improve the government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question that i &apos;ve all of you here : when it &apos;s about the big , important things that we have to do together , all together , will we be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
now , my role in the role of explaining the people who are the new technology , and i thought , i &apos;m going to tell you what i really think . and also trying to look back and understand what &apos;s really going on here with these incredible sprüngen in the front of which so quickly we can &apos;t keep up with .
i &apos;m going to start to show you just a single , boring slide .
so , you could just show the slide .
this is a slide i &apos;ve chosen to take from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but it &apos;s about the overall form .
this slide shows a analysis of a analysis of risc processors compared to the performance of a local area networks .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like so many others , which we &apos;re often find in our field in our field of a semi-logarithmischen curve .
in other words , every step here is a power in leistungsskala .
and this is a novelty that we need to use this guy on semi-logarithmischen curves in the field of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
so , if you could turn the light again .
a little bit smaller because i &apos;m going to be drawing on the paper here .
now , why do we draw graph in technology on semi-logarithmischen curves ?
and the reason i would draw it on a normal curve , where i would like to draw it on a normal curve , so the zeitachse of a way , and this is an unprecedented measure of technology that i want to represent with a graph , then the graph will be silly .
and they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a transporttechnologie , and then it would go on the semi-logarithmischen scale scale very much , in the form of a flat line .
but if something like this is going to happen , then this changes changes .
so , as fast as the transporttechnologie progression , then we could go into a taxi in a taxi , and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not that fast .
this has never happened before in the history of technologie-entwicklung , this kind of rekursivem growth , by which the scale of the scale of all years .
and the question i want to ask you is if you look at these exponential exponential curves , you can &apos;t see them forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything for forever and forever evolved as fast as now .
there are two options .
it &apos;s going to be a classic s-kurve like here , like here , to get something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
it &apos;s about it .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
it &apos;s really like that , that means we &apos;re right now right now in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the past world to a new kind of world .
so , the question i want to ask , and i often want to ask myself , is this new world will be ?
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in the year 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now here we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
more than we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future of every year has reached a year since i &apos;m in this world .
i think the reason is that we realize that there &apos;s something happening .
the transition happens . we can all feel .
and we know that there &apos;s just no sense of trying to look at 30 or 50 years in the future , because everything is going to be so different , that a simple hochrechnung of what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make sense .
so i want to talk about what that might be , this transition that we are right now .
in order to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things , which is really nothing about technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we have to take a step back and look at a longer längeren .
i want to look at this on the zeitskala of the earth &apos;s life .
i think the gesamtbild makes sense , if you split it into some milliarden-schritte .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s a half billion years , the earth was a great , steriler steinklumpen steinklumpen with lots of chemicals .
now , if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , then that gives us a pretty good image about how to do it .
and i think there are the theories that start understanding how everything started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a vereinfachte story of which is that this time little öltröpfchen herumschwebten , which different types of rezepten for chemicals .
some of these öltröpfchen shared a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and to grow .
they were all those things began .
these little öltröpfchen were in the sense of primitivste zellenform .
but this öltröpfchen is not about living in today , because each one was just a small , zufälliges recipe of chemicals .
and every time it shared , they have befindlichen chemicals in the ungleichen chemicals .
so every tröpfchen is a little different .
in fact , the tröpfchen , which was one for the growth of the growth of the growth of the growth as other than others and integrated more chemicals from outside and shared faster .
so these tend to survive longer , and they vermehrten in grösserem .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , if these tröpfchen learned a trick about abstraction .
in any way , which we don &apos;t really understand , this tröpfchen is the ability to niederzuschreiben information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and it &apos;s in a certain chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they have found in this geistlosen , evolutionary way , a way that allowed them to see what they passed , so that that that information was stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is to store information over a 2.5 billion years where they were born , the same .
in fact , the recipe for us is that our genes , which is exactly the same code and the same notation .
and every living creature is using the exact same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re as far as we can write , just for vergnügungszweck , for the vergnügungszweck thing , in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 mikrogramm of a white pulvers , which i &apos;m trying to do in the airports from sicherheitspersonal .
there is -- what i &apos;ve done , i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code consists of normal letters , which we use -- and i &apos;ve written my visitenkarte on a piece of dna , and i have 10 ^ 22 times .
so if you want a hundred million copies of my visitenkarte , i have enough enough for everyone in this room , and even for everybody in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was in reality , i would have been written at a virus , and i would have it in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the niederschreiben of dna was an interesting step .
and the veranlagten cells -- they made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and that began to communicate these cells and share information , so communities emerged from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria actually replace your dna .
that &apos;s why , for example , for example , is increasing .
some bacteria have figured out how to be penicillin by penicillin , and we have this information with other bacteria with other bacteria , and we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate with each other .
now , this communication allowed the community for communities that were in a certain sense of the same boat ; they were synergetisch .
so they either have survived together , or they went out . that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community became more often repeated and by evolution .
now the übergangsstelle is where these communities are so close to these communities that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into the dna .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
at this stage , we have mehrzellige communities , communities from a lot of verschiedlichen , which together , as individual organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a mehrzellige community .
we have a lot of cells that aren &apos;t on themselves .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities began weiterzuentwickeln , so that the level , on which evolution was , no longer the single single cell , but the whole zellengemeinschaft that we call this organism .
so the next step happened within these communities .
the zellengemeinschaften started to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures that made nothing different than that information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the informationsverarbeitungsapparat that have built these zellengemeinschaften .
they started to train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , and understanding of information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
because at that time an individual -- learning has happened now within the period of a single organism , instead of this evolutionary period .
so one organism , for example , for instance , for example , learn how to learn to eat , because she liked schlecht and made it sick , the last time he ate it .
now , this could happen in the life of a single organism , whereas from hundreds of hundreds of thousands of years , because of thousands of thousands of years , it had to be learned from the individuals that died because of these frucht , because these informationsverarbeitungsstrukturen were still not there .
so the nervous system has this particular informationsstrukturen using this particular particular system , because evolution could now be within a individual .
she could take place in a time of time .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
as example , as an example , the raffinierteste version of this is the human language .
it &apos;s a fairly amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , very complicated , unordentliche , verwirrte idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m going to basically grunzende sounds like me in the hope to create a similar idea in your head that a certain kind of similarity with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , turn it turns out to sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the head of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we &apos;ve done , the humanity , is we started to abstract .
we go through the same stages , which have been through the mehrzellerorganismen -- the abstraction of our methods , as we can hold data , is to present .
and the invention of language , for example , was a little step in this direction .
telefonie , computers , videobänder , cd-roms , and so on all our specialized mechanisms mechanisms that we built in our community to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also able to grow faster than we were .
so today , evolution can happen in the amount of microseconds .
you &apos;ve seen tys little evolutionsbeispiel , where he saw a little bit of evolution in the &quot; convolution &quot; program , right before your eyes .
so , we have verschnellert again .
the first steps of the history i &apos;ve told you , dauerten a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
then the nächstens steps , like language and so on , dauerten less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be a few decades .
the process is feeding itself from itself , and so i think , auto-katalytisch is the word for this -- if something increases its änderungsgeschwindigkeit .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosionsartigen curve .
we see the process that feed itself .
i live a living company from building computers , and i know that i &apos;m going to use the mechanism that i &apos;m using to build computers , not using the computer , without having some recent progress in computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it is impossible to design this in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor in the verbindungsmaschine does .
it has billions of them .
instead , what i do do instead of thinking about thinking , is that we think of a kind of abstraktionsebene this machine , and the machine makes it something that makes our capabilities far beyond , better and faster than we could ever do it .
and it makes it part of the ways that we don &apos;t even understand .
a method which is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been used in recently , is evolution itself .
and we install a evolutionsprozess in the machine that &apos;s going on in the mikrosekunden-bereich .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s developed from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , generiere : a hundred million randomly randomly the sequences of instructions .
now , all of these random elected instructions come out of , all of the programs , and ultimately choose the ones that i have to be the next . &quot;
so in other words , i first define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i sort of kind of like numbers , that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve been doing for that .
so , find programs that can put most likely numbers .
of course , the chance at random instructions is very small that they sort of just sort of the instructions , so they don &apos;t actually have the instructions to follow .
but one of those likes to be two numbers in the right order of the back .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences that have come to the next 10 .
store that , lösche the rest .
now reproduziere all of the übriggebliebenen that have the numbers in the best .
and that &apos;s a method of rekombinierens , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their subroutinen , and the children are the characteristics of the subroutinen of the two programs .
so , i have a new generation of programs that emerged through combinations of programs that came to be a little bit closer than others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
again .
maybe you have some mutations .
and try it again with another generation .
all these generations need very few milliseconds only need a few milliseconds .
and so i can go through evolution over millions of years in the computer in less minutes , or in more complicated times a few hours .
and finally , i get programs that can make numbers perfect .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i can ever write by hand .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s verworrene and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , and i &apos;m sure that they do the job because they come out of a series of hunderttausenden programs that have the job done .
because their life depended on whether they did the job right .
i once sat in a 747 with marvin minsky , he ale a map , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
it says , &quot; this plane is from hunderttausenden kleinteilen , which are working together to make their flight secure . &apos; it doesn &apos;t make you ? &quot;
we know that a entwicklungsprozess is not optimal when it gets too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers , for a process which is a process of classical engineering engineering .
it allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities from that yet .
so , gewissermassen überflügelt gives us technology .
we &apos;re using these programs to make the computer much faster , so we can make these processes even faster .
so it creates a rückkopplung .
it gets faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies from today are feeding themselves .
we raise up .
we &apos;re at a point , which is analog to the back at the time , as einzeller-organismen .
so we &apos;re the amöben , and we can &apos;t quite make what the hell we &apos;re doing here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this übergangpunkt .
but i really believe that after we have something else .
i think it &apos;s very hochmütig from to say that we are the product of evolution .
and i think all of us here are part of the creation of whatever comes next .
now , the lunch is before and i think i &apos;m hearing here , before i &apos;m going to hear .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert with sufi-sänger mukhtiar ali .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the time of ancient indian epos . &quot;
if we were going to travel at the indians , we left into a car and schwirrten across the sky .
now we do this with airplanes .
back then , when the big indian kriegerprinz , he took a bow , shot in the floor and water .
now we do this with bohrern and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic was replaced by machines .
that made me sad .
i got some fear of technology .
i &apos;m afraid that i could lose the ability to be able to be able to enjoy at sunset at sunset without tweet and without tweet in my friends .
i found that technology should be possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silberne taschenuhr .
this piece of 50 years of technology became the magischste thing for me .
it became a goldener access to a world full of pirates and verunglückter ships and verunglückter in my mind .
i was able to think of it was when we were holding cameras and cameras to dream .
they kept being inspired by being inspired .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic , instead of killing magic .
with 16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling that can connect readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it brings images and text together and animation and touch .
storytelling , it always takes more senses .
but what do we do with that ?
so i just go to khoya , an interactive ipad app .
it says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here says , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and i got a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows , in gps where i live -- it &apos;s really addressiert me .
the child in me is really excited about the possibilities .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean the magician and the magic , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
it was always exciting in a glass of glass .
so you have to flip the ipad and make fireflies fireflies .
and the lights on the way through the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can be in a single murmel .
and so every book , and every world is a little murmel that i put down here to the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
fantasybücher were always maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows , and it stands , and serves to orientation in the rest of the book .
it also shows you on other places .
i &apos;m going in here .
it &apos;s important for me to do something that indisch is also very zeitgemäß .
these are the apsaras .
we &apos;ve all heard of feen and nymphen , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the apsaras ?
the poor apsaras were caught for thousands of years , in an old muffigen book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary story for children .
a story that &apos;s used to share with new issues like the umweltkrise .
on umweltkrise , a big problem of the last 10 years is that children are sitting in their rooms in their rooms , on their computers , without out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids to the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you have to go out and collect more natural objects .
as a child , i had collections collections of stöckern , rocks , kieseln and muscheln .
somehow the children don &apos;t do anymore .
it &apos;s going to be zurückgebracht . you have to go out to make a picture of a flower in a flower .
in a different chapter , you &apos;ve got a piece of baumrinde fotographieren and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photos that you can put online .
a child in london shows the picture of a fuchses and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox today . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
it creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities with magic , the world and technology .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction where you used to use the video , and through augmented reality , an animation of elfen , which seems to be on a plant in front of the house .
at a point , the screen starts with leaves screen .
you have to do the sound of the winds , right and reading the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the nature of technology can come to the technology and the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and closer to the natural world , and the magic , and the magic , and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really a extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in untersuchungshaft , prisons or todeszellen .
i spend most of my time with the socially weakest in the sozialbausiedlungen and in places where there are lots of hopelessness .
and to be here at ted , to see , to see what it is , i have a lot of strength .
in the short time , i realized , ted has an identity .
you can say things that have the world .
and sometimes , when something about ted , it gets a meaning and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of one teacher &apos;s words , but the words of a dedicated teacher in particular .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a fürsorglicher doctor , but you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t have learned this in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional afroamerikanischen household , who was dominated by a matriarchin , and this matriarchin was my grandmother .
she was a taffe , strong woman , she had an impact .
she had the last word in every familienstreit .
it was also the origin of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a sklavenfamilie .
their parents were born in the 1840ern in virginia as slaves .
it was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery formed very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
if i met it as a little boy , she came to me and umarmte me .
they got me so clear that i could barely breathe . then they let me go .
one or two hours later , if i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; bryan are you feeling my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said no , she umarmte me again . if i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she ließ me .
it was something that made that you wanted to be in close .
the only problem is that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins walked around .
i remember , i have to woke up eight or nine that i woke up in the morning and the living living in the living in the living room .
my grandmother was at the end of the zimmers and staring at me .
first of all , i thought that &apos;s a game .
i looked at her and smiling , but she saw very serious .
this was about 15 or 20 minutes , and she stood up and came over to me , and she took me at the hand , and she said , &quot; come , bryan . you know , we need to talk . &quot;
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out , and she said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t weitersagst . &quot;
i said , &quot; i promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; ehrenwort ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
and then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me just three things . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , you &apos;re going to love to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you &apos;ve got to promise you &apos;re always going to take care about it . &quot;
i turn my mother , so i said , &quot; yeah , grandma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next to me , you &apos;re going to do the right thing . &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise to me is &quot; that you will never drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , rural south , and i have a brother that &apos;s a year older and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this sixpack beer beer with grabbed himself , and i got into the forest and went into the forest .
we just alberten around there as well .
and then he took a drink of beer and offered my sister &apos;s sister , and she was looking at me , and she offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no . it &apos;s ok . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , you know , we do that today , you &apos;re doing everything we do .
i had something , your sister . go , trink a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . just do it . just do you . &quot;
my brother staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , what &apos;s going on . &quot;
and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not still going to be crazy because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells all the grandchildren that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to say something .
i should probably not do that .
this is perhaps in public .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i gestehe that i &apos;ve never drink a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s tugendhaft . i say that identity is power .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people things that they don &apos;t believe in .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they be special .
my grandfather was in prison .
my uncle died of alkoholinduzierten diseases .
and she believed that these are the issues that we need to take care of .
i tried to say something about our justizsystem .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
there were 300,000 people in haftanstalten and in prison .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest inhaftierungsrate of the world .
seven million people are entlassen or with bedingter strafaussetzung .
and i think of the world has changed our world fundamentally .
in social weak and black parts of the population , there are despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male black black in prison between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , on bewährung , or with bedingter strafaussetzung .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles , baltimore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of the black young men either in prison , in prison , to go on bewährung or with bedingter strafaussetzung .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with rassenzugehörigkeit , it &apos;s also entstellt by poverty .
we have a justizsystem in this country that they treated much better when they &apos;re rich and guilty as poor and innocent .
wealth , not verschulden , affects the result .
yet , we seem to be happy with it .
a politics of fear of fear and anger that these problems are not our problems .
we have lost contact .
i think it &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a couple of hochinteressante developments .
my home state in alabama , make them permanent the wahlrecht when they &apos;re convicted .
here today in alabama , 34 percent of the male woman &apos;s male killed her wahlrecht .
we prognostizieren that in 10 years , the ratio of the civic health rate is as high as the verabschiedung of the wahlrechtsgesetzes .
the silence is ohrenbetäubend .
i vertrete children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world that dreizehnjährige children &apos;s children convicted death in prison .
in this country , there are lebenslängliche haftstrafen haftstrafen ohne .
we &apos;ve already been running a lot .
the only country in the world .
i vertrete people in todeszellen .
the death penalty is an interesting question .
we believe , because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is : does a human being able to die for him to die for him ?
this is a very sensible question .
but you can also think about it , depending on how we see our identity .
the other view is not : does anyone for a crime , but : have we made it to kill ?
i find that fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
at nine people we executed executed , one that we &apos;ve executed for innocent finding the entlastet and from death row .
an amazing fehlerquote . one of nine innocent .
i find that fascinating .
we would never fly someone with an airplane , if there are nine planes coming out of the abheben .
but somehow we can do it , in this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question of whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting , because i think of my students , beibringe history . i talk about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time at the end of the rekonstruktion , to the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for afroamerikaner in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people have to be afraid of lynchmobs .
or before bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
and these older people now come to me and say , &quot; mr. , stevenson , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re talking about to stop saying that we need to do it for the first time in the history of our nation &apos;s history : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people we grew up with it . &quot;
and , of course , after the terrorism , of course , the rassentrennung and decades of the rassistisch motivated unterwerfung and decades .
and yet , there &apos;s a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what the importance of our actions in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly hitting each other .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the rassentrennung is not to overcome , without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , they were willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about the death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood after my talk , and he said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply bizarre to hear you speak . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there are no death penalty .
and of course , you can never give it more in germany . &quot;
it was still silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we will ever kill ourselves for the systematic .
it would be gewissenlos of us , aware and gezielt people . &quot;
i thought about it .
as it would feel like to live in a world where german state would make people hinrichten , especially when they were unverhältnismäßig , many jews .
it would be unerträglich .
it would be gewissenlos .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old südens , we have people in this country , in the states of the old südens , more 11 , if it &apos;s black , when it is black . 22 times higher , if the angeklagte is black and the victim knows -- in the same states , in their soil , the body is ruhen people .
and yet , there are these mental abkopplung .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we &apos;re not going to deal with these difficult topics , the positive and wonderful things also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , this realities of leid , abuse abuse , ausgrenzung , ausgrenzung .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to be able to pass in a complex world .
for me , the time to try and talk about the poor , the benachteiligten , who never will be at ted .
but think about a way that is embedded in our own lives .
we all need to believe things we can &apos;t see .
we do this . so , too rational , we think of that .
innovation , creativity , and development doesn &apos;t just come out of our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s these kopf-herz-verbindung , which i believe that they &apos;re driving us , not just being open for all the light and begeisternden things , but also for the dark and problematischen .
vaclav havel , the great tschechische politicians , once said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted all sorts of things . but what we needed was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be sometimes in hoffnungslosen places , sometimes in places . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i think has to be involved in it .
there &apos;s no line of technology and design that allows us to be all human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , ausgrenzung and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity asks a lot more of us when we did not care about it .
she will deeply touch it .
as a young lawyer , i hatt the great privilege to meet pink parks .
frau parks came back to montgomery , where they were two of their oldest friends , where they had two of their oldest friends , johnnie carr , who organized the montgomery-busboykott -- an incredible afroamerikanerin -- and virginia durr , a white , whose husband , clifford durr , dr. king vertrat .
so these women were going to hit themselves .
and then she came up with me and said , &quot; bryan , ms. parks comes into the city . we want to talk .
do you want to dazukommen and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , very much . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what will you do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over , and i just stopped .
it was always so inspiring , so beflügelnd .
one day i was sitting there and i heard this women , and after a few hours , woman came to me , and he said to me , &quot; well , let me tell you what that &apos;s going to be in the same way .
what do you try to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to work against injustice .
wr people want to help people who were convicted .
we want to fight bias and discrimination .
we want to eradicate lebenslängliche haftstrafen without bedingte for children .
we want to do something about death sentence .
we want to lower the number of death .
we want to eradicate masseninhaftierungen .
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; mhmm . mhmm . &quot;
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
and then woman lehnte himself to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why they have to be very , very tapfer . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i think the ted community should be tapferer .
we need to make ways to ask us this challenges : these problems , that suffering .
because ultimately our humanity is going to depend from our humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a couple of simple things .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
when someone is lying , he &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear him , it &apos;s not just a plant .
even who kills someone , is not just a killer .
and because it &apos;s so , there &apos;s a basic human human dignity that has to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think that in many places that are the opposite of poverty .
and finally , i believe that although it &apos;s so dramatic , it &apos;s so beautiful and inspiring , we don &apos;t be measured by our technology , not the things that we develop , not to our intellect and understood .
finally , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and powerful and the powerful and privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the verurteilten , the inhaftierten .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us feel .
sometimes i &apos;m losing a balance .
sometimes i push too much .
i &apos;m going to get tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas are ahead of our thinking in very important ways .
i vertrete these kids who were convicted too hard .
i go to the untersuchungsgefängnis and visit a client that may be 13 or 14 years old , and to be an adult court .
then i wonder : how could this happen ?
how can a judge make somebody into something that it isn &apos;t ?
the judge is looking at him as adults , but i see a kid .
so one night i stayed up too long and thought , my goodness , if a judge can turn us into something else , then it must have zauberkräfte .
right , bryan , the judge has zauberkräfte .
you should also wish that .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think more right , i started working on a bill .
i had a 14jährigen , poor black boys as clients .
and i started with that bill . the headline said , &quot; finally , my poor , 14jährigen clients like a privileged , white , 75jährigen .
so in my bill , i explained that i explained that error is the staatsanwaltschaft and the police and the police .
there was a crazy line of this that in this country , in this country there &apos;s no more error .
the next morning , i woke up and i didn &apos;t know if i knew that crazy , or i didn &apos;t know it .
and i didn &apos;t just write it to my horror , i didn &apos;t just write it .
a few months over , and i just had forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court and that crazy case .
i got into the car , and i was really overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so painful .
finally , i went from my car and went up to the court .
when i was hochging. the staircase to the court , there was an elderly black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came over to me , and he said , who are you ?
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; she &apos;s a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and umarmte me .
then he did the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , there was force .
it touched something deep deep in me , identity , the ability of every single one , to contribute to a community , to a community of hope .
well , i went to the gerichtssaal .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , did you put this crazy bill ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
i had written these crazy things .
polizeibeamte came in and stellvertretende staatsanwälte and office workers .
in handumdrehen , the gerichtssaal was full of people who were angry , that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
i saw the janitors and i saw the janitors .
he kept looking through the window , and he could hear the whole tohuwabohu .
he went up and down .
finally , this older black man came up with a very besorgten gesichtsausruck in the gerichtssaal and sat down behind me , almost on the verteidigungsbank .
ten minutes later , the judge quit a pause .
and during the break , a polizeibeamter came in that the janitors was in the gerichtssaal .
this deputy ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the gerichtssaal ? &quot;
the older black man . he looked at the deputy , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to say to this young man , you don &apos;t lose the goal . don &apos;t give them up . &quot;
i came to ted because i believe that many of you understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far ausschwingt , but that it &apos;s the justice of justice .
that we &apos;re not fully designed as humans , unless we take care of human rights and grundwerte .
that our survival of the survival of every single one .
we need to connect our visions of technology and design and creativity and creativity with humanity , compassion and justice .
and most of all , i want to share with you , that &apos;s just saying , you don &apos;t lose the goal of your eyes . don &apos;t give them up .
you have this audience in this audience , in this community , in this community , and you know , and this community , and to help you and do something .
what else can we do ?
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a volksentscheid in this spring , where it &apos;s about , actually , in fact , in fact , in the spring of business , something from the geldstrom umzuleiten , which else flows into the politics of punishment .
here , in california , for example , in the next five years , you &apos;ll have a billion a billion dollars for the death sentence for a billion dollars .
and yet 46 percent of all the tötungsdelikte is not with a verhaftung .
56 percent of all vergewaltigungsfälle come from court .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
this referendum is going to suggest that referendum money in more sicherheitskräfte and security .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the verbrechensrate is enormously down in america .
this fact is often asked into a context with increased inhaftierungszahlen .
what would you say to somebody who believes ?
well , in fact , the number of gewaltverbrechen has not changed very .
most of the masseninhaftierungen in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of gewaltverbrechen .
it was the fehlgeleitete kreuzzug against drugs .
and so the dramatic numbers are coming up with the prisoner .
we have hinreißen from the rhetoric of the punishment .
now we have &quot; drei-verstöße « , the people forever , for the gitter , for a fahrraddiebstahl , for the theft , for the theft of good , rather than that you get them to give you the victims .
and i think we need to do more to help people who have become a straftat , not less .
and i believe that our current can &apos;t help anyone .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
bryan , you &apos;ve actually made a string here .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
thank you for ted . thank you .
bin laden &apos;s death is going to get an increased .
famine at 2 : famine in somalia , three : pfefferspray .
bösartige , bösartige , bösartige .
six : social decline : 65 dead .
tsunamiwarnung : tsunamiwarnung , 9 .
different speakers , mass destruction .
recession . gridlock . doomsday . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just some of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but they could have collected the last six days , or the last six years .
in fact , the media prefer to show us negative topics because our minds are actually giving attention to these subjects .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for this .
every second each day , our senses will start much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because it &apos;s more important us than our survival , the first stop station for all the information is part of the information , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our frühwarnsystem , our gefahrendetektor .
it sortiert and durchkämmt the whole information on the search for any andeutung in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old saying , &quot; when it blutet , the demand is very true .
now , with all of our digital devices , which gave us seven days , 24 hours a day , all of these negative messages , it &apos;s not a wonder that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a wonder that everybody thinks that the world always goes worse .
but maybe this isn &apos;t the case .
it may be reality .
perhaps the enormous progress that we &apos;ve made in the last century through a series of forces that we &apos;ve done in the next three decades , in the next three decades , to create a world of abundance .
well , i don &apos;t say that we have no big problems -- climate crisis , artensterben , water water and energieprobleme -- we &apos;ve got that .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at all problems , in a very long way , but they end up .
let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled which is the inflation of the population of the population of the world &apos;s population .
child mortality has a tenth .
so , you know , the ernährungs- , elektrizitäts- and communication costs have to have a vielfaches .
steve pinker has shown us that we &apos;re currently in a very peaceful time of menschengeschichte life .
and charles kenny is up at 80 percent in the last 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we are increasing our expectations .
in fact , we &apos;ve defined poverty .
consider that a great proportion of americans who live under the poverty , are access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , tv phones , klimaanlagen , air control and cars and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the imperatoren of the earth , could never dream of solche .
so the basis of a lot of this form technologies , and these are growing expotentiell .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that is going to be the information information , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the preis-performance-quotient all the 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less and less than a supercomputer from a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first of all , how smooth it is -- in good times , war or peace , recession , depression and hochkonjunktur .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
it &apos;s slowed down for none of our big problems .
also , despite your logarithmic verlaufs on the left , they &apos;re going on up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to everyone .
&quot; cloud-computing , &quot; which is what my friends &quot; infinite-computing &quot; , &quot; sensors and networks , 3d printer that allow me to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , fuel , impfungen and food , digital medicine , nano-materialien and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of the ibms supercomputer in &quot; risk ? &quot;
it was great .
i &apos;ve been looking for the newspapers and looking for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson bezwingt human enemies . &quot;
risk is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the language of language .
imagine that these artificial intelligence were available every owner of a mobiltelefones .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i started here at ted , which is called &quot; singularity university . &quot;
we bring our students to all these technologies , special focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we are asking the students to create companies , products and services that can affect a decade , in a decade , within a decade .
think about this is that a group of students can affect the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this would have lächerlich .
today , we can have verweisen on dozens of companies that have been able to do this .
if i think of creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating a knappen surplus .
scarcity is kontextbezogen , and technology is an ressourcen force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of napoleon iii. in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
napoleons soldiers got silber-besteck , napoleon himself .
the king of siam got aluminium-besteck .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and platin .
this is the reason why the dome was made out of aluminum .
even though aluminum 8,3 percent of the erdmasse takes it , it &apos;s not a pure metal metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silikate .
but then the technology of the elektrolyse was developed , and so cheap that we use it with our wegwerf-mentalität .
then let &apos;s project this analogy to the future .
we think about energieknappheit today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that &apos;s filled with 5.000-mal more energy than we use .
16 terawatt energy prasseln all 88 minutes to the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not scarcity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time , the cost of solar power in india to 50 percent of the diesel-stroms -- 8.8 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar is 50 percent in the last year .
last month , this was published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sunny parts of the united states , solar &apos;s six cents per kwh , compared to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have a energieüberschuss , we will also have water .
let &apos;s talk about wasser-kriege .
remember , as carl carl , in 1990 , when it was on saturn when it was on saturn , back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a pale blue . &quot;
because we &apos;re living on a wasserplaneten life .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered to 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s 97,5 percent saltwater , two percent , and we &apos;re struggling to fight 0.5 percent of water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new nanotechnologien on the way , nano-materialien .
and the morning with dean dean kaman , one of the innovators of knowing it , i want to share with you -- he gave me permission -- he gave me permission -- he gave me permission -- the slingshot , and many of you may have heard . it has the size of a kühlschranks .
it can produce a thousand gallons of clean water per day from various sources -- whether water , verschmutztes water , latrine -- and all this for less than two cents a liter .
the president of coca-cola is just eingewilligt , a big test-projekt with a hundred units in developing countries .
and if everything is going on , and i &apos;m very confident , coca-cola is going to apply to the technology global countries on all the planet around the planet .
this is technologieunterstützte innovation that we have today .
and we also saw this in mobile mobile phones .
you know my god , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of mobile phones in the developing world to the end of 2013 .
just think that a massai-krieger with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better mobil-kommunikation than president reagan , 25 years ago .
and if you search with your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has the information and communication that nobody has ever been predicting .
and it gets even better , the things that you and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , hd-video and photograph , libraries of books and music , technology to medical diagnostics -- are literally entmaterialisiert and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best thing about it is what we expect in health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure , with the qualcomm-stiftung that called $ 10 million qualcomm tricorder .
we &apos;re asking teams all over the world to connect all these technologies in a cell phone , that you can talk to the device , because it is with ai , you can test reinhusten or your blutwerte .
and to win , the device needs to be a better diagnosis than a team of hochqualifizierter doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the krankheitslast and 1.3 percent of the employees of health care .
if this device sequenced a rna- or dna-virus , which is not known , it calls it out at the point and prevents a pandemic pandemic a pandemic pandemic .
but now to the biggest force that will lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the 7-milliarden-marke .
and by the way , the largest absicherung against a population explosion is a better education and food throughout the world .
so , in 2010 , we had that right under two billion people .
by 2020 , we get voraussichtlich from two to five billion internetnutzer .
three billion new heads that we &apos;ve never heard before , the global communication will join .
what do these people need ?
what are they consume ? what are you going to want ?
and instead of economic gridlock , i see one of the greatest economic anschübe of history .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars that are going to flow into global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be able to get a healthier healthier , and they &apos;re going to be trained to be trained , and they &apos;re going to be able to use the ability to use 3d 3d computing and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated members of menschengemeinde , productive members ?
how about a set of new , never gehörter voices .
how would it be , the oppressed , wherever they are , to give a voice to notice and create change , for the first time ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
how about beiträgen that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i &apos;ve learned by the x prize is that little teams that motivated through passion and focus , can create extraordinary things , things that could create large companies and governments only in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might have already seen .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will evolve .
according to its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medizinforschung .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university university and so on .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who play the game online .
and it showed that today , as the human recognition , the human recognition pattern is better than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best protein-ordner of the world , it wasn &apos;t a mit-professor , it was no caltech-student , and it was a person in england , manchester a woman who was working during the day as an assistant in a reha-klinik and was the best protein-ordnerin of the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what i believe is enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to put us the big challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a diy-innovatoren .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropen .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online with the new challenges , and to do what is needed .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to have something about a verändernswertes piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical scientist , and i am .
and maybe i &apos;ve been a long time in business , when i can allow it to give up a piece of my own wrong prestiges to give up this .
but before i come to the real issue of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re close to the saisonende and move to the world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full with great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; moneyball &quot; seems about statistics and turns out about statistics , and to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to relate to a statistics that i hope most of you have heard .
it &apos;s the durchschnittsleistung of the schlägers .
we talk about one 300 when a bat is 300 .
that means that the player is safe to beat 3 .
this is called the ball beating , he &apos;s coming up , he &apos;s going to go , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball on the first base , didn &apos;t have done it in time and the viewer was in security .
three from 10 from 10 .
do you know how to call a 300ter in major ?
well , really good , maybe a all-star .
do you know how to call a 400ter ?
that &apos;s someone in the rest of the rest of the rest of 10 .
legendär -- like ted legendär - -- the last major league in baseball player who met over 400 times over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel some more comfortable , or maybe a little less likely i &apos;ve talked to you about it .
suppose you have a blinddarmentzündung , and you &apos;re going to überwiesen to a operateur that durchschnittsleistung 400 400 400 in terms of blinddarmentzündungen .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine you live in a certain remote area , and you have a beloved person with verstopften herzkranzgefäßen , and your hausarzt überweist this to a kardiologen , whose durchschnittsleistung is at gefäßdarstellung at 200 .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s aufsteigenden .
and she &apos;s schlägt .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you believe in like the durchschnittsleistung or a nurse or a nurse or a nurse , a geburtshelfer , a geburtshelfer , a rettungsassistenten ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody in all of medicine knows that there is a good surgeon or a doctor or a doctor .
however , what we do is that we have each of them , including me , including me in the world to be perfect .
never make a mistake , no one is going to be thinking about the details of how to be done .
and that &apos;s the message that i put in medical school .
i was a mobile obsessiver student .
in high school , he said that brian goldmann would learn for a bluttest .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little dachstube at the toronto in the toronto , general hospital , unweit from here .
i learned everything .
in my school , i learned , i learned the origins and the tail of every muskels , every arterie , every branch of the aorta wegführt , obskure and ordinary differentialdiagnosen .
i actually knew the differentialdiagnose of renale tubuläre azidose .
and i &apos;ve been collecting more and more knowledge .
and i was good at cum laude .
and i left the medical school with the impression that i knew if i knew everything , or at least as much as possible , or as much as possible as possible , as possible , that i was immune to make the mistakes .
and it worked for a time , until i met a printer .
i residierte on a lehrkrankenhaus here in toronto , as a woman , was brought into the notfallabteilung of the hospital .
at that point , i was zugewiesen in the kardiologischen service of service .
and it was my assignment when the notfallpersonal kardiologischen was advice to study the notfallpatienten .
and feedback to my oberarzt .
i saw a printer , and she was in atemnot .
and when i put her in front , she did sound .
and when i abhörte your chest , i could hear a knackendes sound on both sides that told me that she suffered under kongestiver heart failure .
that &apos;s a state in the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart , instead of pump the blood up in the lung in the lung lung , and that kind of kind of kind of kind of allmählich , so that came up .
and that was not a hard diagnosis .
and i asked her and made me the treatment .
i gave her aspirin . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call diuretics , wasser water , so they ausschied the liquid .
and over a year and a half hours , it began to feel better .
i felt pretty good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without my oberarzt .
i didn &apos;t take that up and i did what i should have , which would have been a call at my oberarzt , so that he had a chance to have had a chance to have a single image .
and he knew her , he was able to have more extra information to her beizusteuern .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the hilfsbedürftige doctor .
maybe i wanted to succeed so successful and so capable of taking responsibility that i was like that , and i would be able to deal with my patients without kontaktieren .
my second mistake was worse .
so that &apos;s what i sent her home , i sent her home to me , i was a quiet voice to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
so , in fact , in fact , that i asked the nurse that i asked the nurse , and i asked the nurse , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and he said , &quot; yeah , i think it will be fine . &quot;
i remember it as being yesterday .
so i unterzeichnete the entlassungspapiere and an krankenwagen and rettungsassistenten and they brought home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day i had this nagende feeling in my stomach .
but i continued to work .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , verlies the hospital and went home to drive the car , when i did something i didn &apos;t do otherwise .
i went home through the notfallabteilung on my way home .
and there &apos;s another nurse said , she didn &apos;t see the sister that he saw after wife , but another three words to me , and those three words fear most of the notfallärzte that i know .
other medical doctors are also afraid , but the notfallmedizin is very special because we &apos;re just looking at the patients .
the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients in the patient ? &quot;
asked the nurse sachlich .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular tonlage .
so she was back .
she was back and they die .
about an hour after she reached home , after i was sent her home , she kollabierte , and the family phoned , and the rettungsassistenten brought them back to the notfallstation with a 50 , which is a dangerous schockzustand .
they didn &apos;t breathe and was blue .
and the notfallpersonal all strands .
they gave her blutdruckerhöher .
they closed them on the beatmungsmaschine .
i was shocked and to the inner zerrüttet .
and i went through these , because she came to the stabilisation on the intensivstation , and i hoped she would recover .
and after two , three days realized she was never going to be an awakening .
she had not suffered a behandelbaren .
their family came together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they found the geschehenen .
on the neuten day , you liesen them -- a printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
they say that they never forget the names of the versterben .
and that was the first time i learned this .
and the next couple of weeks , i gave me to the first time , and i found the first time for the food , which exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you all know , you know , if you have a secret to the best friend , if you have a secret to the best friend &apos;s worth , and you &apos;re going to get the best friend , and the best friend , and that &apos;s a terrible discussion , if you &apos;re going to end up the bad sense , and you know , you know , you can never again .
if you do wiedergutmachung , you never do the mistake .
this is the kind of lehrreicher shame .
the food environment that i &apos;m talking about is the ones that makes you sick in the innersten .
it &apos;s the one that says that you &apos;re doing bad , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t on the bottom of mine , he was very love .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was going to glättete and make sure that i was not going to be sued .
but i asked myself these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the oberarzt ? why do i get them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why did i go into medicine ?
slowly , it &apos;s safe .
i started feeling better .
and then on a bewölkten day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun , and i said maybe i can feel better again .
and i was with me that if i doubled my efforts to perfection , and never even back to a mistake that the voice could be verstummen .
and she did .
and i kept working .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in a kommunalen hospital north of toronto , and i begutachtete a alten man with gereiztem rachen .
it was a lot and i was in a hurry .
he always showed here .
i looked into the rachen , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him an prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and even when he walked out of the door , he showed his rachen .
two days later , i came to my next notfalldienst , and my chefärztin asked me to a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember you ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the gereizten ? &quot;
it turns out he turned a streptokokken-infektion .
he had a potentially lebensgefährliche disease called epiglottitis .
you can google that , but it &apos;s not an infection in the rachens , but it &apos;s not causing the top of the atemwege .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got intravenöse antibotica and recovered a few days later .
and i went back to the same tortur of shame and selbstzweifel , felt free , and went to work to work again and again and again .
in a notfallschicht , i have two times .
so there &apos;s a lot of things , especially if you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that was only 14 patients a night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no mängel in their treatment .
and i thought he was nierensteine .
i ordnete the kidneys of the kidney . when this was without befund , my colleague at the patient at the patient who was a verhärtung in the lower right-hand sector , and called the operateure .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i ordnete fluide to rehydrieren him and asked my colleagues to reveal him .
and he did , and when he looked at a verhärtung in the right lower sector , he called the operateure .
in both cases , operierte , and it was fine .
both of me are nagten at me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which is what many of my colleagues say , but total nonsense .
some of my klöpse happened happened in the last five years .
you know , you know , without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t end with my mistakes and talk about it , if i can talk about the quiet voice that tells me what really did not happen , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i had a room in a room -- like now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time of someone who talked about fehlschlag about fehlschlag ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and you might hear about any doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about your own mistakes .
if i was full of a room with colleagues with colleagues , and to tell you , and to tell your immediate support and to tell you , i would probably not get to the end of the second story , before it really would tell you , anyone would make a joke , you would change the topic and forget the rest .
and in fact , in fact , if i knew my colleagues in my hospital had lost somebody lost the wrong leg , then i think i &apos;d have trouble looking into the eyes .
this is the system we live in .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system where there are two fundamental positions -- the ones that make mistakes mistakes and the ones that don &apos;t do . those who einschränkt schlafmangel , and that ohne with the bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response like antibodies antibodies who attack a human being .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we &apos;re the ones who make mistakes out of medicine , we have a safety system .
but there are two problems .
in about 20 years of medical sendungsbewusstseins and journalism , i &apos;ve got a personal medical study about medical mistakes and false treatments about that all of the things that i did for my first article for the toronto , &quot; white coat , black way , &quot; writing .
and what i learned is that errors are absolutely unumgänglich .
we &apos;re working in a system in a system in which one of 10 medikationen is either a false or wrong , in the krankenhausinfektionen and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and zahlreicher , or devastation .
in this state , about 24,000 kanadier of umgänglichen mistakes .
in the united states , the institute of medicine has put up the number 100,000 .
both are strong , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as much as we should .
and is the crux .
in a krankenhaussystem , in a krankenhaussystem , all the two two to three to three to three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
schlafmangel is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake , so we can take a perfect krankheitsverlauf for a patient .
then i take the same patient with brustschmerz , make it verschwitzt and geschwätzig and give you a slightly alkoholisierten breath , and suddenly , the story is durchsetzt with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptoms .
all of this is fehler .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and all of the fehlerbehafteten gesundheitsexperten , then at the end , no more left .
and you know the leier about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
and i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; black art , &quot; i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about yours ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show him with the microphone .
and then their pupillen , they &apos;re going to come in front of their head , and they look hard to go down and eat , and start to tell their stories .
they want to tell stories . they want to share their stories .
you want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i fabrizierte . &quot;
what they need is an environment that &apos;s versetzt them .
what they need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new arzt doctor is a man , white to make his humanity , she &apos;s not proud to make mistakes , but it takes everything to learn something from them so that it can be passed on .
it divides your experience with others .
she supports when others are talking about their mistakes .
and it shows others their mistakes , not to be bloßzustellen , but in a liebevollen , supportive way of all of them .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people live the system with life , and if that &apos;s like that , then people make mistakes of time .
so , the system is going to be able to find mistakes that make it easier to make mistakes that everybody who &apos;s going to do the health system , in which anyone who have a health care system , can actually respond things to the things that can represent the potential , and even rewarded for it , and that specifically for people like me , they should make mistakes , and they should be rewarded for the begradigung .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m neu .
i &apos;m a man . i &apos;m making mistakes .
but i &apos;m bedaure das. , but i &apos;m trying to learn best to get to others .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding from me , but i can live with that .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about veränderbare normwerte .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories to use time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was here .
you might think that he jagte finken , but that &apos;s not true .
he actually collected fish .
he described one of them as a very .
it was a zackenbarsch .
to the &apos; 80s , it became a big style .
now he &apos;s on the red list of endangered species .
and we heard a lot of times from the galapagos or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
they still describe them as pristine .
what happened here ?
the second story is to make a different concept of veränderbare taillenweite .
because i &apos;ve experienced it was when i was in 1971 in 1971 .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad sonnenbrand , and i was convinced that i really wasn &apos;t there .
it was my first sonnenbrand .
as you can see , the uprising of palmen and some mangroven umsäumt .
there were buntbarsche from about 20 inches , schwarzkinnmaulbrüter , a unterart of buntbarsche .
the fischgründe of these buntbarsche were very ertragreich , and the fishermen lived well , and they were doing above about it in ghana .
when i got back 27 years later there was the fish on half its size .
there &apos;s five centimeters .
they were genetically erdrückt .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the happiness to be there .
so it changed nothing , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story told me about my mittäterschaft in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- rather at the beginning of the &apos; 60s -- förderte europe a lot of entwicklungsprojekte .
fischförderung meant countries that were already 1,000 fish , the industrial fishing fishing , of course , is called mutiara .
i was driving on that , and we made it all over the southern südchinesischen ocean , and especially in the javasee ocean .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know that it was the bottom of the ocean .
90 percent of our fangs were sponges , other animals that are connected to the bottom .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there on the trümmern , den , were korallenriff-fische .
basically , the bottom of the sea was deck and then became zurückgeworfen .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
within a year , you get an survey , and then you start with working fishing fishing .
the reason is going to change . in this case -- in this case , or soft corals , is crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t eat it , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started living alive .
she was not ertrunken .
then they wanted to kill them because they could eat it well .
in fact , this mountain , in fact , this mountain of trümmern , every time you &apos;re going to drive in areas , you &apos;ve never had a fish .
it &apos;s not documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adapt our normwerte to the new level of the new level , and don &apos;t call us what was there .
so , if you look at it , what happens .
on the y-axis , a couple of good things : biodiversity , number of orca , the green country , the green one .
it changes with time . it changes , because people are their actions , of course .
every generation is looking at the images that you &apos;re looking at at the beginning of your conscious life , as standard , and you get rid of it .
the difference is then seen as loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
there can be an order of changes .
and at the end , they just want to get the erbärmlichen remains .
now that &apos;s largely our goal .
we want to get things that have disappeared or things that are not more like they were .
you could think that the problem of people was involved in that , certainly when they were in räuberischen societies , animals were killing animals , and they were aware of a few generations what they had done .
because obviously there &apos;s an animal that had a lot of the things that was very common , very often before .
so you don &apos;t lose vorkommenden animals .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not being seen as a loss .
we &apos;re focusing on the great animals , and in the ocean , we are the big fish .
they &apos;re less likely to catch them .
with the time remains little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the normwert .
the question is , why people accept that .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
they &apos;re going to confirm it , because the evidence , as you in an early form , you &apos;re not that you would like the evidence .
for example , for example , there &apos;s an anecdote that the report of a kapitäns project , who can be used in this area , is not used to be used , or von , because it &apos;s not scientific .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in educated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormously big role that can play a marine reserve .
because in marine areas , we basically put the past the past .
we &apos;re putting the past the past that people can &apos;t understand , because they have changed and very low .
and so the people who can see a marine reserve and the insight from the insight that it allows you to zurücksetzen their normwerte .
what is with the people who aren &apos;t possible , because they don &apos;t have access to people in the west , for example ?
and i think of the art and the film , perhaps fill the gap and the simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago there were grauwale -- 500 years ago .
and the farbtöne and -schattierungen may remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were being touched by this -- besides the pocahontas-geschichte , why were it so touched by the bilderwelt ?
because it &apos;s something that has been lost in a way .
so , the only one that i &apos;m going to give is the only one thing that i &apos;m going to focus on cameron , so it &apos;s about cameron ii .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist ostdeutschland , you had to know if you had a typewriter a typewriter a typewriter .
they also had to sense a leaf with beispieltext from this typewriter .
the reason for this : the government could track where a text text came from .
found an article with falschem gedankengut , could find the creator the creator of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand in the west , how anybody could do something like that , and how much the speech of speech .
in our own countries , we would never do this .
but when you buy a new farblaserdrucker in 2011 , in 2011 , and print a site , this side of bright yellow flecke on every page , in a pattern that makes the site clear to you and your printer .
that &apos;s what happens to us today .
and that nobody seems to be aufzuregen .
and this was an example , in which our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three hauptquellen of the existing online-problemen .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really going on in the world : we can divide attacks into categories .
we have three hauptgruppen .
there are online-kriminelle .
for instance , for example , this is mr. kiew golubow .
and the motives of online-kriminellen are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use online-angriffe to make a lot of money , a huge pile of money .
there are several known cases of online-millionären , multimillionären , who have made their money through attacks .
this is wladimir tsastsin from tartu in estonia .
this is alfred gonzalez .
stephen watts .
björn sundin .
this is matthew anderson , tariq al-daour and so on .
these people have come online , but they &apos;ve been acquired , for example , by example , for example , for example , for example , to try to put money out of our bankkonten , while we do our online-banking , or keylogger that we &apos;ve collected our kredikarteninformationen on the eingabe about the keyboard , while we had infected computers online .
the u.s. intelligence account , two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam &apos;s jain here , and on this account were 14,9 million dollars as it was frozen .
mr. jain himself is unbekannt , the aufenthaltsort is unknown .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s more likely to be more likely to be a online-verbrechens than a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be worse .
in the future , most crimes will play online .
the second largest angreifergruppe that we can observe today are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something -- i &apos;m going to think , or by the audience .
groups like anonymous are over the last 12 months , and they have become one of the hauptspieler on the field of online-angriffe .
so these are the three hauptangriffsgruppen : criminals that are going to do it for the money , hacktivisten , like anonymous , but the last group are nations , governments that lead attacks .
there &apos;s cases that we &apos;re doing .
it shows a great thing that governments will attack their own citizens .
diginotar is a vollmachtszertifikat from the netherlands -- or it was .
in the last fall , it had to anmelden , because diginotar had been hacked .
somebody was hacked , and had the system had been hacked .
and last week in a meeting with dutch regierungsvertretern , i asked one of the leitenden of that group , if he was able to do it for possible , that because of diginotar-hacks people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying in a row like this ?
diginotar is a zertifizierungsstelle .
they sell zertifikate .
what do you do with zertifikaten ?
well , a certificate is required when you have a website with https , for example , gmail .
so , we all of us , or a lot of us , or a lot of us , or a lot of us , , or a lot of us , or a lot of us , or a lot of us , because , you know , you know , they can trust more than local anbietern , and they &apos;re encrypted , so that the local government can &apos;t herumschnüffeln in their conversation .
but you can , if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign .
zertifizierungsbehörde hacken and fake zertifikate .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in diginotar .
how about the arab spring and the things that happened in egypt ?
now , in egypt , in egypt the headquarters in april , the headquarters headquarters the egyptian geheimpolizei , and they found a lot of records .
in these records , a folder was called &quot; finfisher . &quot;
and in this folder , again , notes in germany , which egyptian government sold a few programs that they had sold to -- in very large scale -- in a very large scale -- to capture any communication of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for 280.000 euros to the egyptian government .
the firmenhauptquartier is right here .
so western governments have totalitäre governments with hilfsmitteln governments with their own own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago , the so-called staatstrojaner found , and this was a trojaner that was used by german regierungsvertretern to bespitzeln their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to put it in a kriminalfall verdächtigt , it &apos;s quite secure your phone .
but today we are far beyond .
they zapfen their internet connection .
they use tools like the staatstrojaner to bespielen their computers with a trojaner that allows them to monitor their entire communication , their online-diskussionen abzuhören , to collect their passwörter .
so if we &apos;re thinking about things like this , the obvious answer would be the people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t hurt me because i &apos;m a braver citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i don &apos;t hide anything . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we now , in 2011 , our governments like trust , it is every right , that we &apos;re going to be emitted forever .
and we trust , we don &apos;t trust to any future government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of betonblocksteinen .
the first betonblocksteine were made 1868 and entstammten of a simple idea : module from cement with the extra measurements that fit .
betonbausteine were very quickly the meistgenutzte baueinheit in the world .
they &apos;re able to build things that were bigger than us , buildings , bridges , a stone after the other .
essentially , the betonbaustein has become a block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out with this .
it was &quot; automatically verbindende stone . &quot;
and within less , lego lego went back every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 rocks for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create nice houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it for everybody .
lego has essentially den the betonbaustein , the building block of the world , and it took a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the same year , the next revolution was announced the next revolution , the next one .
the transistor was a little plastikeinheit that uns us from a world of static , aufeinandergestapelten building blocks into a world where it was interactive .
like the betonblock , the transistor allows us to build much larger , more more complex , a stone after the other .
but there &apos;s a hauptunterschied : the transistor was just for experts .
i don &apos;t accept that that the building block of our time for experts , and therefore i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i began to explore this idea how to put the power of engineers into the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing littlebits .
let me show you how they work .
littlebits are electronic module that have a specific function .
they &apos;re vorgefertigt , light , clay , motor and sensor .
and the best thing is that they connect together with magnets .
so you can &apos;t sit together .
the stones are farbcodiert .
green is a copy ; blue is electricity , pink is input and orange .
so everything you have to do is to connect a blue and a green one , and you can build very quickly larger kreislaufe .
they add a blue one blue to a green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between , and so they created a little dimmer .
take the switch out of a pulsmodul that &apos;s here , einzufügen , and they made a little blinker .
add that buzzer for an extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a lärmmaschine .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
beyond the simple play , littlebits is actually quite powerful .
instead of code , verdrahten or löten , they have to allow them to be simple , intuitive gestures .
so , in order to slow down , just turn it down to that button , and it does the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind littlebits is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world into a gebrauchsfertigen rock .
lights , sounds , solarelemente , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve got littlebits to children and see them playing .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , as you start the electronics that you can understand in your life , and you don &apos;t learn them in school .
like , for example , like a nachtlicht , or why the doors of the aufzugs offenbleiben , or how to respond to touch .
we also brought littlebits .
so , for example , for example , for example , for example , designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing with littlebits as material .
this is what we see with filz paper and water bottles , like geordie ...
a few weeks ago , we brought risd to risd , and they gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- only box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; power . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project they did , a bewegungsgesteuerte konfetti-kanone .
but wait , this is really my lieblings-projekt .
it &apos;s a vermeer out of play-doh , the fear of darkness .
for these nicht-ingenieure , littlebits became another material , electronics became just another material .
and we want to do this material for all available .
so littlebits is open source .
you can go to the website , all the designvorlagen download and make them yourself .
we want to encourage the world of creators , the inventor , the inventor , because the world that we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
so , you go and start to invent it .
thank you .
